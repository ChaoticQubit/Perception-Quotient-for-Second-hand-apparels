https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HB82,Cynthia,Exactly what is pictured!,"This dress fit exactly as I expected. The dress isn't lined and the fabric flows beautifully. The color is orange/red. I am pear shaped and was able to wear a size12 instead of my usual size 14 because it isn't fitted in the hips. I had a little more room than I wanted in the waist area, but that could have been because I am short waisted and the dress is made to accommodate a taller person. Without the extra fabric in the waist it would have accentuated my figure better. I am 5'3"" and the dress fell about 3 inches above my ankle. I wore the dress with black boots as we had lots of snow and it was 12 degrees. The dress arrived in condition to be worn without any ironing necessary. I did need to use static guard because I had to wear a winter coat. I would definitely recommend for a work day or breezy outdoor lunch/dinner function.","January 14, 2019",True to Size

I'm posting the best picture of the jacket, but I saw some photos of me from other angles that were not flattering because the jacket made me look so much bigger than I really am. It's a fun, different style, but I wouldn't wear it again and definitely wouldn't buy it.

Modern, Stylish and Wearable... for so many occasions","Pros: The fit was excellent; I am between a size 6 and 8 and after reading reviews sized down to a 6- it was perfect. This cut is so flattering and great if you have a bit of a tummy to hide due to the ruched effect. The play between pattern and asymmetrical ruffle is superbly done. I actually had someone compliment just that aspect. You can dress this up or down. I wore it the first time to a jazz club with a black top and heels. Then I wore it again to a dinner party with black heeled boots for a slightly more casual look. Cons: Really can't think of any except that the zipper (which is on a bias) was sometimes difficult to zip up. This isn't a con, really, but the fabric is lighter than I expected, but if worn with tights and boots is fine for a winter party.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAR41,Melissa,"Fun, trendy, flowy","This was a favorite dress of mine. I sized up a bit too much but the cut is really fun to wear and I love the black, red and navy sections. It is very versatile. Also great for layering! I wore this one day to the office with a suede jacket and one rainy cool day in Seattle with a slim black long-sleeved shirt underneath. Very chic.","November 18, 2019",True to Size

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU59,Sheila,Soft Coat - Hard 2 Clean?,"I rented another coat from Louna that was also a size Small, but too big. This coat appears to fit me better. It is very soft and warm, super cute and stylish. However, it is really hard to zip and the coat I rented had two pieces of human hair (different colors - different people?) stuck in the fabric which makes me think it is hard to clean and not very sanitary.","December 21, 2019",Everyday

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU59,Celana,a soft COMFY sherpa,"I thought the wrists wear a little tight, the color a bit dull, the sherpa was definitely worn- so worn that it was difficult to zip it up. Despite all that, it was incredibly warm and comfy to put on.","February 10, 2020",Small
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU59,Kelly,SO SOFT,"This was probably one of the softest, most comfortable, and cutest teddy jackets I've ever worn. I really had to stop myself from buying it. It is bulky, but that's the look I was going for and I got a ton of compliments. The zipper is very hard to zip due to the fluffy coat exterior, but it's still warm enough for a 40 degree night. The inside isn't teddy, it's a really soft satin-like material. Overall I can't say enough good things about this jacket.","January 7, 2020",True to Size
