Stretchy dress so be sure to order 2 sizes cuz it may be overstretched or run big on you. Super comfortable! The sequence did not irritate my arms at all...unlike most of my other coworkers who wore sequence dresses.","January 21, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK308","Lys","Loved! Sexy + Classy for NYE. Excellent Customer Service by RTR.","Day of delivery RTR said this dress was no longer available in my size (8), but they were sending the backup (6) and a similar dress. I could also select any dress to be overnighted to me. But as you can imagine, not much was left the night before NYE. I was bummed. BUT the 6 in my original choice was PERFECT! The spare was gorg too. I was thrilled to wear my original choice. 100% sequins. Color is stunning! Bc it's not a mini & doesn't show cleavage, it's both classy and sexy. I felt beautiful.","January 3, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK308","RTR Customer","Many compliments!","I usually wear a 4 or 6 and I think for an athletic body the 6 was ideal. I would have liked it a pinch tighter around the waist but other all it fit great. Don't forget about the sequins and it can get a little itchy under the arms.","September 9, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK308","Morgan","Sparkling all night!","I am between a 4 and 6 usually. I went with the 6 to just be safe. It was a bit big in spots (waist, back, length)... but otherwise seemed true to size. The sparkles are LEGIT and I had so many compliments throughout the night!","July 31, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK308","RTR Customer","Compliments & Glam!","I did not want to let this dress go back! It's fit was perfect. The dress is very comfortable and light. I am 5'5"" 140 lbs and a 6 fit PERFECT. It is hard to tell in photos but this dress is Navy underneath all the sequence & beading work. It's perfect for all occasions.","June 25, 2019","Formal Affair"

Wore for a red carpet/black tie event.","Normally I am a size 10/12 and the 10 fit me perfectly, with room to spare. The material and dress is very flattering and I received a ton of compliments.

I love to say my favorite color is sequins and this hits the mark! It was very flattering and fit my curves very well. I went braless and wore no spanx - didn't want them and didn't need them! I probably could have sized down as many others have said but it was still very flattering and comfortable. Rent this dress - you won't regret it!","February 5, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK308","Kathleen","Unbelievably gorgeous and surprisingly comfortable.","This dress is gorgeous. I cannot tell you how many people complimented me on the dress. It is stunning in person. The strap situation took a little time to figure out. It felt like the dress kept pulling to one side, but I finally got them in the right spot. I have super sensitive skin and was worried the sequins would irritate my arms, but I had zero issues. The only con was losing sequins. I feel like our cat found all the stray sequins that I lost. It wasn't noticeable, but I know I lost a handful.","February 5, 2019","True to Size"

I contacted RTR immediately with a photo, replacement dress arrived overnight! Huge thanks for the prompt service!! Rented the dress for a Mardi Gras Fundraiser Event, it was perfect! The fit was beautiful, I was comfortable dancing all night long in this piece, no irritation from the sequins. I loved the adjustable straps!!! I'm 140#, 5'3"", 34 D, athletic build and this dress was true to size. I felt the structure was perfect and didn't need a bra.","January 15, 2019","Formal Affair"

I wore it to dinner and a concert on New Year's Eve. It fit like a glove and the adjustable straps on top were great for making it fit nicely with my small chest. The dress had just enough stretch to make it very comfortable to wear.","January 7, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK308","Kayla","New year's eve","Loved it! Such a beautiful dress. Loved the color and fit. It has adjustable straps which helps me since I don't have a big bust. I could've sized down for a tighter fit but the 16 was fine.","January 5, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK308","Anna","Perfect New Year's Sparkle!","I loved, loved, loved this dress! The neckline and crossed back are so pretty in person. The sequins are definitely more of a turquoise green in person than forest green as I expected, but the dress is still very pretty! It is also lined very well, so the sequins don't scratch at all. I usually size up as some of the RTR pieces run small, but this dress definitely ran true to size. I wore the 2, but probably could worn the 0.","January 2, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK308","Meredith","Perfect for a holiday party","I wore this to a holiday party at the Field Museum. I loved this dress. Fit perfectly and I have never gotten so many compliments on a dress before. It really stood out compared to the typical black dress/jumpsuit at the parties. Also the sparkles didn't scratch my arm up like other sequin dresses have in the past. Would definitely recommend.","December 8, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK308","Katie","Photographs really well!","I have a big bottom half and usually wear a 10 in a-line dresses and a 12 in sheaths. This dress was only available in a 12 and it fit wonderfully. The 10 would've fit I bet but may have been more snug. If you're wanting it to hug your body to give you more of a shape, maybe size down, especially if you aren't super curvy because it's stretchy. The back straps are adjustable so it's good for all breast sizes. Really loved this dress.","December 8, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK308","RTR Customer","This dress is a knock out!","Absolutely LOVED this dress for my husbands Christmas party. It is the perfect green for the holidays. I rented two sizes but ended up wearing the 10 for comfort. This dress is very comfortable and has stretch and give (was supposed since usually the sequin dresses fit right.) I got so many complements all night long and was about the only one not in something plain black! Would def rent again! awesome on a curvy figure!","December 3, 2018","Party"

I could have worn a 6, I think, but with the adjustable straps, the 8 worked fine. Recommend wearing a push up bra if you're small chested. Stunning dress!","November 18, 2018","Formal Affair"

But it was also very comfortable- I could move in it easily and it was not scratchy like some sequined dresses can be. It seemed a little big to me. I actually had ordered the 6 as my backup size, but they were not able to get me the 8 at the last minute. The 6 was actually a little big around the chest and back, but the straps are adjustable so that helped. It was perfect for NYE!","January 9, 2019","Large"

The dress was a little longer than I expected (past my knee) but I am also short so that's expected, still loved it and the way it looked on me!

The straps can adjust in length, too, which helps. The color is very pretty - the base is navy (not black as I thought originally), but in a dim party atmosphere it still looked good with black shoes/jacket. The sparkly green is an eye-catcher! It was perfect for a holiday party. Overall, it's comfortable and only a little scratchy under the arms from the sequins. The sparkly dual tone is also flattering for camouflaging any stomach insecurities. I loved it!","December 10, 2018","True to Size"

I am typically a size 2 or 4, and the 38L (size 2 equivalent) was perfect. Beware if your hairstyle is something that needs to be kept in place nicely-- this dress has no zipper, it just goes over your head! Still, amazingly stunning. It hit just right for my height at 5'7.5"", but I'm sure someone a couple of inches shorter can still wear without a problem. Taller might be a bit more difficult unless you didn't mind ankles showing.","November 21, 2019","Formal Affair"

I usually wear a size 12 in most of RTR's unlimited rentals because of my full bust. They didn't have the dress I wanted, and all they had left in this dress was a size 46 (size 10). I ordered it and crossed my fingers. It fit just right! I'm 5'4"" 150lbs with 38DD chest. It fit my curves and had plenty of room for my DDs. It was a little bit of a struggle to get on because it has no zipper, so I recommend doing hair first, or pulling it on from the feet up. My friend is also wearing a RTR dress, so we were happy with our choices. :)","January 28, 2019","True to Size"

And because it goes on over the head - you need to put it on first then do hair & makeup. Because of the gorgeous cutouts front and back you don't need much jewelry - just some simple earrings and a bracelet! Would definitely order again.","February 14, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP8","Amy","Amazing black formal, honestly thought about purchasing!","This was my second formal option after the first arrived damaged. I knew from previous rentals this designer makes great pieces. I'm 5'3"", 150, 34 C and work a 4 inch heel. I wore the dress in a 44long and the length was perfect for my heel height. The dress fits snug, but in a supportive way vs. uncomfortable. It's understated with a lot of impact. The front and back slots along with the gathering along side the dress really makes this stand out. I was able to wear a regular bra. I gave this 4 stars and didn't purchase because the fabric around the cut outs seemed a bit stretched out, but nothing fashion tape couldn't fix for the night. And for what it's worth, this dress has no zipper and has to go over the head. Also there is no slit in the bottom so your range of motion while walking is a bit limited, so maybe not the best dress if you have to do a lot of running around at an event. But all in all loved the dress, loved the fit and will keep renting from this designer.","October 24, 2017","Formal Affair"

I was in panic mode as this was my best friend's wedding and she wanted us in long dresses. I spent about 2 hours in the store trying on literally everything and was skeptical about this gown given it's straight fit but it was perfect. the fabric is very stretchy & tight so it almost acted like spanx which was awesome - did not need to wear a bra or anything. since it is so tight and taught though, just a heads up that in order to have my hair and makeup done i had to put my dress on first, otherwise I would have totally gotten makeup all over it and messed up the updo. Honestly, people raved about it and it was also super comfortable, it was great. Highly recommend!","September 19, 2017","True to Size"

The fabric is forgiving and very comfortable. The thickness of the fabric truly hides the bumps and lumps and really makes you feel confident wearing it. There is not a zipper so be sure you put it on before your hair and makeup. I am 5'10"" athletic build. It does run a little bit short so glad I went with the long and a smaller heel. The side ruching helps to hide the tummy. Fantastic dress and I felt like a million bucks wearing it. I highly recommend this dress so any shape or body size.","August 30, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP8","Nicole","Best Combo of Black Tie and Business!","This dress is perfect for tall curvy gals! I had a black tie awards ceremony in NYC, so I needed to be formal yet professional, and this dress worked perfectly! It was also sexy enough that I felt beautiful, but not too sexy for a work event. The fabric ensures the dress fits like a glove. I'm 5'9 and opted for the long size since I wore three inch heels, and the long size fit perfectly. I think this dress may run a touch large -- I wore the 48 for this dress, but I definitely wear a 50 in other dresses by this designer. As other reviewers have mentioned, however, due to the unique nature of the fabric, there isn't much difference in sizes. I would say size up if you have a large chest and/or want the dress to be less form fitting. I also opted not to wear undergarments underneath because the fabric is very supportive.","April 5, 2017","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP8","Jennifer","Subtle elegance","I may rent this again sometime! That's how much I liked it. Maybe it was because of all the compliments I received but it definitely exceeded my expectations. I thought it was going to be more low-keyish but it's a sleeper! It was a little blah when I put it on so I added a belt for some sparkle. There were several photographers at the event and they each took several photos (although I forgot to get one myself other than the poor mirror shot I sent to a friend). A few notes that aren't a con but just be aware....this lovely is not intended to be floor length. It hits right at the top of your shoes and felt short for a minute but it's just perfect. It does not have even a walking slit. So it's not for dancing, big strides or getting into tall vehicles! I am 5'10"" and wore a kitten heel. The fabric is as lovely as all my previous RTR dresses have been, but you literally wriggle yourself in and out with no zipper. Not hard but a little difficult. (Read: do your hair & makeup after it's on!) I did order the 48L as my backup but the 46L fit much nicer. I am a 36DD and have no hips or butt. This dress is simply lovely.","December 3, 2016","Formal Affair"

It was very slimming on my body shape by being more form fitting on the top and coming out for on the bottom. The extra piece across the skirt also added a nice touch and I think added to it being flattering on someone who wants to cover up/slim down larger hits and thighs.

The pattern helps disguise things, but just make sure you don't only have hot pink undies! Otherwise, very flattering and cute dress.","April 30, 2019","Small"

So after quick thinking my mom & I cut a lace tank top & safety pinned it into the bust of the dress & then it was fine. But it would have been totally inappropriate for my to wear to my JR Prom without doing that. It was a good height for me & I'm 5'3. & it's true what they say, it is scratchy on the underarms.

It's super flattering, fits really well and I love the embroidery. The little ruffle on the sleeves aren't too big or ruffly like a lot of other dresses with ruffles are. It hits just above the knee, would be appropriate for almost anything.","September 11, 2018","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL199","Birvy","Chameleon dress!","I received this dress as a back up after my original dress was shipped too late to arrive for my event, customer service worked with me to find something that was similar in style to my original order. I ended up really liking this! It was for a late afternoon to dinner wedding, and it went from afternoon to cocktail really well. I love the details in the embroidery and even though I am generally not a fan of the cold shoulder trend, it worked on this dress (and I could still lift up my arms). It was true to size, though a little loose in the middle, but that tends to happen with me... if there was an 18 available it probably would have looked more tailored to my body. It was comfy without shapewear, though it was hot out and the lining tended to stick to my backside when I would stand up. The only other true con was that the hook at the neck tends to pull on your hair. All in all, while I was disappointed I had to track down customer service when my original dress' delivery date was after the event I was ordering for, they did a really good job making up for it!","September 3, 2018","Wedding"

I had a size 18W as I’m an 18 on bottom. It was maybe one size too big on bottom and two sizes too big on top. I generally do not rent sheath dresses bc of problems sizing but this was a back up. I will definitely try it again for a special date night! The dress: I loved the choker style, and the flutter sleeves. The entire dress is made from embroidered material that is just gorgeous! The fit: I think it ran big, but again I’m not familiar enough with the designer to know my size. I took one picture with the waist pulled in to see if I could create a waist with this one... I’m not sure it’s possible but I may be wrong if I had the right size...??? It was super comfortable and there was nice room in the neck so you don’t feel choked!

The embroidery is beautiful, but in person I was just not a fan of the sleeves so I pinned them inside the dress. They were a little to much for this Plain Jane gal.

Fits about the same as others in the brand; I'd say true to size. It's a little too exciting for work (depending on your job and comfort level)--just a little too low cut if you're on the busty side and a little too short (and I'm 5'3).

The colors and fabric are beautiful, pictures do not do it justice. I gave it a 4 out of 5 only because it was tight around my hips (just had a baby 6 months ago).

The setting of the event was in a beautiful, older home, which had been converted to a bar/restaurant... this means it required a dress that was equally unique! When I saw this dress on RTR, I knew it was the perfect dress for the occasion and setting. The color is a perfect blend of blue and green (a bit more green), and the gold thread really catches the eye. The design of the ""wings"" was a beautiful surprise, and made the dress surely stand out! I would rent this dress again if there was an extra large option... because this was tight! I paired this with a spanx-skirt and panthose (it was 5 degrees outside), and lucky for me, it seemed to hold it all in! All in all, I felt pretty and received a lot of compliments! Thanks again, RTR!","February 12, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP10","Samantha","Love the color and lace","I have been debating renting a dress and when I saw this I loved everything about it. The teal color, lace and gold accents. I'm 10 months post partum and am still dealing with extra pounds. I read every single review and the ones similar to me because I really wanted it to work. I'm 5' 4"", 161 lbs, 36DD, bust measurement is 41"". I chose the large and medium as my back up even though I was sure it probably wouldn't fit. I think the dress runs small, I went with the Large and could not zip it up by myself but luckily with someone else's help it fit. It was tight but I was comfortable enough. Dress was a tiny bit short, found myself adjusting occasionally when sitting but was not that bad. The dress came super fast and the only issue I had was the return label would not scan at ups so they had to correct the shipping info. My suggestion would be to show the size chart info based on actual measurements like bust, waist, hips. I find that's helpful when trying to determine size. Overall I am happy and recommend this dress and will definitely use rent the runway for my next formal event.","October 22, 2018","Wedding"

I am a curvy, size 16, and though I loved this dress it was troublesome as the night went on, even with a plunge bra & garment tape, the low plunge gaped open.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR69","Maria-luisa","","I love this flirty dress by Saylor! Running big with no stretch, I recommend wearing a size down for your primary size. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and at the hips. It works best for A-C cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a NuBra or a deep-plunge bra since the neckline is so low. At 4’8”, the length hit mid calf on me. The lace and ruffle details give this dress a romantic feel, however the plunging neckline makes it risqué and possibly problematic for bustier women (Fret not, a cami could be worn underneath). The material is really soft and light-weight making it perfect for warm weather. Pair with stiletto pumps and a cute clutch to complete your outfit!","February 2, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR69","Jamie","Low cut and not so flattering","I had hoped this dress would have worked out better than it did. First, it was very low cut. I wore an undergarmet to cover it up but if I hadn't it would be ridiculously low. The other issue I had was the dress and lace were cut so that the line of the dress went up in the middle, which made the dress hang in such a way it looked like your tummy was huge. Even while sucking it all in, it looked like there was a hugely round tummy going on because of the cut. All in, cute concept but not flattering and too low cut.","December 30, 2018","True to Size"

I fell like the body of the dress was true to size but the bust had just a little too much fabric to feel safe from any wardrobe malfunctions. Be warned that under the front ruffle is a slit that comes all the way up to your crotch if you're short like me. Although the dress was a bit risky, with some strategically places garnet tape and spanx it looked and felt amazing.","December 19, 2018","Party"

The v cut and subtle peek-a-boo under the chest means there really aren't any undergarments you can wear. Sorry for the boob shot I posted, but it shows how even a backless strapless bra shows. In the end it took stick cups, as the dress has no support, and double sided tape to pull it off. But on the positive side, once that was finally settled the dress was fantastic! Many compliments, very feminine and fun! I would not recommend this dress for anyone over a C-cup however.","December 16, 2018","True to Size"

The unlined lace panel at the bottoms added visual interest and ventilation. The neckline allowed for a standard bra with little to no cleavage. At my height the lace came just to my knee.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NK107","Anna","One of the most unique dresses","I wanted to rent this dress for past occasions, but everyone told me it looked like an ""80s prom dress."" However when my initial dress I chose for this particular wedding wasn't available, I called Rent the Runway's spectacular customer service and they let me choose this dress in the other's place, no sweat. I am a size 6, but ordered an 8 as my backup, because a lot of reviews said the bust area ran small. Unfortunately, with my already small bust and slightly wider stomach and waist area, this dress was surprisingly difficult for me to be comfortable in. The bust ended up being too large, and the zipper didn't go all the way up in the back for either size. I ended up finagling it to make it work, and it looked great and was easy to dance in once I figured out how to make it sit properly on my body. It ended up looking gorgeous and I got a lot of compliments, but I was not the most comfortable in this outfit, and my experience with this dress was not the most enjoyable! :( If you are looking at this dress and you like it, I would suggest someone with a slightly larger bust with a slimmer waist.

Given the amount of tulle in the bottom, the dress has a weight to it, as such, I didn't think two straps felt secure enough to hold the dress. Moreover, I wish the straps were adjustable. I have a short torso, and I wish I can bring up the dress by an inch or so. Overall, I really love the dress, it's so unique and fun.

The first one I tried on (with the damaged boning) was a 0 and it fit well. However the 0 in my new order was too tight, so I ended up wearing the 2. It is definitely tight in the lower ribcage area and generous in the bust, but it wasn't anything impossible to manage with fashion tape. I received compliments all night long, and it ended up being the perfect dress for the evening. Because it does have a very full skirt and leans on the side of being more formal, I opted for very simple accessories to dress it down a bit.

The amount of compliments I received was crazy, but even more gratifying was how amazing I FELT in the gown. The only other dress I've ever felt so beautiful wearing was my wedding gown. The bust on it was a bit big, but it was a simple fix for me, where I simply basted a couple of loose stitches on the inside, which were easily removed before I sent the dress back. Or someone without sewing skills, a padded bust cup insert would have been another good solution. The dress was understandably very wrinkled when it arrived, but was easy to steam/iron for a perfect look. Another ""pro"" for this dress is that it's so stunning, you really don't need flashy accessories to complete the look. Strappy, nude heels and a nice pair of earrings are all you need. The dress is comfortable to wear, and light as a feather, so even on a hot summer night would be a great choice. I literally can't say enough positive things about wearing this dress.

The combo of the poof and the red makes it an absolute showstopper. I can only give four stars tho because there were some issues for me with the fit- the bust was a bit loose (and I'm a 34DD) but waist was a bit tight.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NK107","Madison","Felt like a princess in this red tulle dress!","Flirty and fun, the top was sophisticated with a deeper v neckline but a poofy bottom that made the outfit more whimsical. This dress has an awesome exposed back that would look best without a bra, or with a NU bra. The lace provides a structured support in the front so braless is totally feasible. This dress fit small in the waist as the lace has little give. I was wearing a 2 and the 0 would have been too tight. I would recommend sizing up for the backup. The hip area had plenty of room and the tulle falls loosely like a ballerina around from your waist out. This is defs a hip friendly dress. At 5’7” this dress hit below the knee almost mid calf. Great for black tie wedding or any event that you want to make a statement. Would go great with some dangly earrings and a shiny clutch.","February 9, 2017","Small"

I loved the sparkles and the design on the dress does make it slimming. It probably would have been better for me to wear a Medium, but only the Small was available and from what I read in the reviews I thought I'd be ok. My biggest con to this dress is that it rode up constantly. I was adjusting all night, which is not ideal when I am constantly moving/dancing.

This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. I did not wear a bra since it has secured padding around the bust area, however strapless bras are fine. At 5’6”, the length hit floor length and still looks great with heels.

However, I chose to wear it, and it was comfortable, and got a compliment or two. Not my favorite, but happy it worked out.","December 18, 2017","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VLV19","Cassie","Surprising!","I received this dress as a backup to my backup after a major shipping error caused all the dressed I actually ordered to not show up. I was pleasantly surprised with how beautiful this dress was. I was skeptical when I saw it on the hanger. It's a shift dress so it's very roomy and comfortable. The beading is beautiful which makes the dress really sparkle. I'd say it runs a little big but it's not meant to be form fitting. I ended up wearing 2 sizes bigger than normal because that was all that was available but it still looked fine. The arm holes hung a tad low. Overall I was very comfortable and thought the dress looked great and received many compliments.","September 18, 2017","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VLV19","Meghan","first RTR dress and I'm officially obsessed!","This dress was the hit of the party! I got countless compliments all night long, even from guests I'd never met! It was a last minute exchange and something I never would have picked out for myself, but it was simply beautiful. I'm generally a 14/16, but 18W was the only size in store available at the time, and trying it on felt like if I had actually been a size smaller that it could have been tight but I can't be sure. Also, this might just be me, but beneath the arms the hole sat a little lower than I thought and my bra continued to poke up. My arms are a big insecurity of mine anyway, so please ignore the black shawl I have on in the photo. But for being so ornately decorated and appearing heavy, I spent the afternoon of an August wedding outdoors and the whole night inside dancing and feeling incredibly comfortable. It was definitely an unforgettable night, a lot due in part to my new favorite dress. Do I really have to send it back?","August 27, 2017","Wedding"

The ruching and the material concealed any lumps. Although plan accordingly so no pantylines in the back. As others noted, it's narrow at the bottom so you can't take big steps (but it was fine for dancing!) I wore with 3 inch heels (I'm 5'6""). I would give this a million stars if I could.

Two points I think are worth mentioning for someone interested in renting - 1. It goes sooo low cut, I used 3 pieces of boob tape to shorten the plunge and kept checking on it all night that was a little annoying. 2.

I was comfortable all night. I'm 5'5"" and wore a 3-4 in heel and it was the perfecct length. I was worried, since I sized up, that it would be too long, but the 12 R was perfect to fit my curves and height. Hourglass girls don't need much accent in this dress, so I skipped a necklace and just wore strappy, jeweled heels, a pretty bracelet and chandelier earings. I got compliments all night.

I'd definitely wear it again. I'd say I'm small on top (2) with a bit curvier hips (approximately size 3 or 4 in pants), this dress had space in the hips for me.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SDN5","Lindsey","I loved this dress! It was beautiful and flattering.","I really enjoyed wearing the dress. I reluctantly pinned the bottom of 'v/plunge' just a tad to be a little more conservative as our children were also attending the event. Had it not been a family affair, I would have left it alone. Either way, I definitely had to tape the sides of the 'v/plunge' or they would have gaped open when sitting or leaning over. I ordered the 4 and the 6 as a back up. They seemed to fit the exact same except the 6 was a tad longer and had more fabric over the chest in the front. Both were a tad tight in the back near bra area - the 6 was just as snug as the 4 which is strange. I am 5' 4"" and the length was great. I did holdup the side a bit when walking not because it was too long, it just felt a little restrictive when taking steps. I would definitely rent the dress again.","March 11, 2019","True to Size"

I would not go with a long if you are my height, I wore a 3inch heel or so and the length was perfect. This dress while it's perfect it is a bit confusing to get on, once you get it, just a tip try it on before you get your hair and makeup done so you can figure it out, and head first, just trust me... you'll understand once you are trying it on. Also, I didn't wear a bra -- it fit so tightly and my bust is small, you couldn't tell and I didn't need too. I was much more comfortable that way! I was able to dance all night with no issues. You may want to just tape a few pieces of the body tape to the chest because when I sat and bent over it would bunch a little, it wasn't anything terrible but I would use it if I wore it again just to play it safe! I wore this to a Halloween formal black tie wedding and it was the perfect LBD statement piece.... it was a perfect dating spin on a classic with the crossed front and the appearance of a two piece. I received so many compliments. I cannot say enough about RTW either. I had originally picked this dress and changed my mind and ordered another but it didn't fit me at all... my wedding was in Florida, and I live in West Virginia.... they overnighted me the dress to Florida in time to get it to wear to the wedding.

It accentuated all of my curves in all the right places and ways! It isn't very stretchy and runs small, so I wore the bigger size. I had rented the US Size 4 and US Size 6 and wore the 6. I am normally a 4, though. I actually even wear 2 in Calvin Klein (what I wear most). I did not need to wear a bra and I was fine with the ""underboob"" showing so I didn't even pin it. I am a 34C in bra size. I am 5'1""-5'2"" and the length was perfect for me (I wore the Regular, not Long) once I put my heels on. I would say my heels were 4 inches.

I got a ton of compliments- overall it fit beautifully and true to size, was roomy enough for my bigger chest, and didn't slide down. However even though it was a petite it was still incredibly long (even with heels) and I did have to hold it while dancing, etc to avoid it being stepped on. The average American women is 5'4"" so I'm not sure why a petite dress would still be made for someone who is at least 5'5"".... serious question to the brand!? I would've given it 5 stars if it had a more reasonable length. It's also pretty skintight so if you're self conscious about your curves it may not be the right dress. The sequin and gold is so beautiful though and shimmers in the light- it doesn't look tacky like I was worried it might.

I was the MC for a 300 attendee event at a Nature Museum, and I achieved my goal of standing out in the crowd. This dress was a little more than I was originally planning, but it was fun, and I think made the whole event feel special. My guests alternately described the look as ""the Oscar statue"" to ""the golden mermaid"". I had to be a bit mindful of the top gapping, but it didn't move too much. Would probably have looked great with a strapless bra. Very comfortable on a curvy body, though it left nothing at all to the imagination. Not a confidence-optional dress. I needed to tape up a 3"" hem in order to run my event for 5 hours. I couldn't walk very quickly once taped, but it held and I looked dignified walking slowly through the museum.","April 23, 2018","True to Size"

But, I didn't want to risk dragging the dress on the ground. I wore a bustier bra with it. The 2 was definitely snug, which is probably good for strapless.

I called RtR just to see if there was anything we could work out as the event had been changed to the following weekend. RtR completely solved my problem and was extremely friendly in doing so.

Last year, I rented the black dress just like this one last year and I loved and had no problems, so I decided to rent the gold one this time. I normally wear a size 6-8 but with a lot of the designer dresses on RTR who use vanity sizing, I tend to wear an 8R. I rented the 8R and the 10R as a backup. Instead, I was sent the 6R and 10R. The 10R was way to big and the 6R didn't get over my curvy hips. Both dresses looked like they seen better days. Most of the sequins was either worn off or frayed. I didn't like it. Customer Service was excellent and they overnight end me the correct size in a new dress that wasn't as how can I say it...overly used and rented. I was worried the dress wouldn't come in time but I was guaranteed delivery by 12noon and the dress arrived way before then. Way to go Customer Service! I wore the 8R and ended up having a great time. The dress was sparkly and gorgeous, I got tons of compliments. My sissy told me she didn't notice the previous dress looked too worn, but I was glad Customer Service was able to send me a new dress. I will definitely rent again. Oh, and the stretch in the dress was super comfy. I wore spanx anyway, but you can go without.","March 26, 2018","True to Size"

I needed a dress for a black tie wedding, and was nervous about ordering a long dress online, BUT after scouring the reviews, and dissecting pictures others posted, I settled on this dress (especially because it came in petite) I wore a 0P (I'm 4/11 and 92 pounds for reference); the dress was PERFECT. I wore 3 inch heels, and a strapless bra, and was very comfortable. The dress and train dragged a smidgen on the ground, but when I was dancing I just held it up a little, it didn't cause any issues walking in it.

I wore it to a 'beach formal' wedding. I normally wear small, but the small felt slightly tight around my ribs so I went with the medium to feel more comfortable on the dance floor. Like others have said, the lace around the neck will not stay up exactly like it does on the model, but I did not mind.","April 18, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KP18","RTR Customer","Fun wedding!","Loved the look and color of this dress! I ordered the XS as a backup and it fit a lot more snug than the S, which is my usual size. Only negative was that it was a bit tight around the waist but the back/underarm parts fit perfectly! The color was the perfect green for an early spring and nighttime event. It wasn't too Christmassy, which my only worry. It was a perfect dress to dance the night away!","March 20, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KP18","Victoria","Looks great with cowboy boots!","Since the rustic trend is so in when it comes to wedding decor, I've attended a number of weddings where cowboy boots is appropriate. This dress hit right below the knee so it was perfect to wear with my boots! I worked gold jewelry with it, including statement earrings, since the dress is pretty simple but it could easily be dressed up or down. Would look great on any skin tone. Just beware, the back is REALLY open so if you want something more modest I'd go with another choice.","February 28, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KP18","RTR Customer","FAVORITE dress!!!","I LOVED this dress. Wish I owned it. It was comfortable and cute. I wore it without a bra without any problems. I wore it to a summer wedding and was worried the color might be a little too ""fall"" but I think it was great for the wedding. Got lots of compliments. It is a popular dress though - a woman came up to me and said she had rented the same dress a few weeks before for a different event and recently I saw a woman wear it at an event I attended. The wedding I wore this dress too included a very traditional Catholic wedding ceremony and the dress back felt a little exposed for the setting, but it was perfect for the reception. Months later, I still think about this dress, I really loved it!","February 6, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KP18","Leila","Loved this dress!","Wore this dress for a formal and loved it! the back cut out was beautiful, length was perfect (I usually have issues with dresses looking short bc of certain larger features), color stood out while still being neutral and in my comfort zone, and was comfortable too. The only negative thing was that the lace of the turtle neck wouldn't stay up, but it wasn't noticeable to anyone but me. I was worried the dress would look a little too casual for a formal event but it was easily dressed up with gold jewelry.","January 7, 2019","Party"

I wore this dress to an indoor fall wedding and received compliments from several people - even the bride! It wasn't too short and although the back is open, it's still classy and not too revealing. I rented a Medium and a Large and went with the medium because it fit perfectly. Several girls that rented this dress mentioned they did not wear a bra , but I wore an adhesive bra just for a little extra lift - if I had a little bit larger breasts (I'm a 34C), I probably would have been comfortable without the adhesive bra. Th dress is a beautiful olive-y green and photographs pretty well too.","November 28, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KP18","RTR Customer","Very pretty, romantic, dress","The dress is so beautiful, and the sage green color is so pretty. I rented the medium, but should have gone with a small since I am smaller on top. The top is the most fitted part, and the collar was loose since it was meant for a fuller chest. That being said, it wasn't anything a little pinning couldn't fix! The open back is beautiful without being too much, and it's lined well so wearing it without a bra wasn't a problem. It was perfect as a wedding guest dress","November 18, 2018","Wedding"

Only thing is that it fits a little snug and the way the back is cut out can give you a tiny back-roll! I wish I had gotten one size up to maybe prevent that but I doubt anyone really noticed. Super comfortable. Definitely worth it!!","November 6, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KP18","Lauren","Even prettier in person!!","I was skeptical about this dress initially, especially hoping that the neckline wouldn't be too tight. It was gorgeous in person and absolutely perfect for a Midwest Fall wedding. I loved the color and open back. I wore a nude lace bandeau underneath that showed but coordinated in the back to give my chest some support. The large was a bit too big and loosened a bit through the night, so I probably should have worn the medium.","November 1, 2018","Wedding"

The color and lace material were beautiful, and the seems around the check were in really good shape (unlike many other lace dresses I've worn). The fit was a little looser than expecting, I would have sized down if I had known. There was just a lot of room in the chest area and the straps were kind of long but couldn't be adjusted to tighten enough. Nothing a padded bra couldn't fix though.

I had them on the tightest they could be. It wasn't a major problem while standing or sitting but I was at a wedding and found myself pulling up the dress as if it were strapless while dancing. The color is beautiful and I received multiple compliments. I would rent this again","October 8, 2019","Wedding"

This one was the best option over the two (the medium was too big on the other dress). I got TONS of compliments and felt so elegant in it. Only reason I gave it a 4/5 is the bust is a little big so I had to wear a strapless underneath.

I am short with an hourglass figure the dress was flattering it was like a normal fitting dress to above the knee and then the lease went down to my ankles it was very fun and cool and beautiful. My only complaint is that the straps though adjustable are not fully adjustable and they are way too long I had to clip them back. Overall this dress is a winner very flattering for an hour glass figure.","August 3, 2019","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/STS77","Lisa","Loose in bust, length for taller women","Overall I liked this dress. It didn't get the mass rave compliments like my last RTR showstopper, but it was still pretty. I was glad I read reviews- the bust is big - which I was looking for because I'm breast feeding and so many dresses are tiny up top- but I had to tighten the straps to full tightness and wear a strapless bra, and i was still just filling out the top. I would have liked it to have an inch or two of fabric less to have felt more secure in it. I also wore 5"" heels, and the dress fell much longer than intended. I didn't mind, I felt like we had a 1940s look going. Comfortable fit through the body, the design made my waist feel very skinny and the lace detail felt a little glamorous, but NOT one of those dresses you put on and instantly feel super sexy in. I felt like I was selling it to myself because it was dress #3 and I had no other options.","July 31, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/STS77","RTR Customer","<3","I really liked this dress! I feel like it is JUST this side of true to size. It tends to be more towards the ""runs large"" spectrum of true to size, if that makes sense. I'm full figured, so I wore XLR and had the XXLR as a back up. Ideally, size LR would've been perfectly fitted, but the sizing worked out. The dress is very easy to sit in and to dance in! I do like that it has adjustable straps, but it doesn't adjust very much and I feel like someone with a smaller bust may not be able to adequately fill out the top. I will admit I was a little bit nervous when I received the dress because it is not much to look at as far as hanger appeal. The stitched overlay is a dark olive green color with black detailing and the lining is more of a dark hunter green. However, it shows up beautifully under the party lights and in photos! I really love the cut and all the interesting detail of this dress!","December 8, 2019","True to Size"

It was comfortable to wear, a flattering fit (especially on my larger chest) and not too short on my 5'11"" frame. Paired perfectly with the mint Kendra Scott necklace I rented to wear with it.

The bright pink with turquoise color really stood out during a spring brunch. The top is a bit low cut, but not enough to be uncomfortable. I wore a big turquoise necklace to brighten up the entire look and ""cover up"" a bit. The A-line flare is extremely flattering. And pockets! The material is a bit heavier which is nice if you're going to be outside and there is a chance for wind. No chance for the skirt to fly up.

Complete with a great lining and flattering pockets that weave into the pleats, this dress was comfortable and practical to store my lipgloss and phone without having to carry a purse. It could have been easily worn with a regular bra, but I didn't wear one and had great support. The color combination is unique, stands out from the regular black dresses seen at social events, and is easy to dance and move in. It can easily be dressed down to wear to a shower or party or dressed up to wear to a wedding. Enjoy renting this one!","January 2, 2016","True to Size"

The length was great - I didn't have to worry about anything being exposed whilst moving about. The colors area bit louder in person, but it's not such a bad thing. I paired it with dark green diamond-like studs, beige suede kitten heels, and a black scarf around my shoulders when I was cold.","January 1, 2016","Large"

In most of the RTR photos, the fabric looks almost like a heavy, embroidered material, but it's actually a lovely silky print. The straps and neckline meant that I could wear a regular bra (there are snaps in the shoulders to keep bra straps from slipping)., and there was plenty of room for 'the girls' :-)","October 29, 2015","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NL48","Erika","Great print, awkward bodice","PROS: This dress is really flattering on a curvy figure. It looks embroidered in the photo, but really it is a flat print on a shiny fabric. Great colors. It was fun to dance at this hoedown wedding because I could swing it around. CONS: I would not rent this dress again because the bodice was so generous. I am a 36 B and I wore a padded bra. The bust of the dress was gaping all night and even the straps fell to the side a few times. This dress is great for a tall person or anyone with a larger bust. If you are short you simply won't have enough space to keep the straps taut and if you are small chested (BODY POSITIVE HERE) you will be pulling up the neckline all night. Also did not get one compliment all night. I thought I looked AWESOME!!","October 5, 2015","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NL48","Allison","Flattering shape, colors really stand out, and pockets!","I felt so good in this dress. The bust is snug and then it fans out right below the rib cage. It gave my athletic body a little more shape which I loved! After reading other reviews, I knew not to expect thick, embroidered fabric. But the fabric was sturdier than some reviews claim. It is a thick spandex-y material and had good structure. I usually go between a 0 and 2, and the 0 fit perfectly. I think if I had a larger bust I would have needed the 2. If you have thicker hips you could wear a smaller size and be fine because the skirt fans out. I wore this for an early fall wedding and would definitely rent again for a spring event!","October 4, 2015","True to Size"

Make note though, as mentioned in other reviews it is actually a flat cotton fabric (in the mode photo it looks more iridescent). My only issue was that it as a bit big in the chest area. Since it is sewn to create a bust area those of us that are a bit smaller may feel a bit lost in the bust of the dress. It still worked great for a late summer wedding. And it has pockets - you can't beat pockets!!!","September 7, 2015","Wedding"

I have an hourglass shape, so I often have trouble finding things that cinch in the waist enough but still fit my curvy bust and hips. I probably should have ordered the 2 knowing the skirt was full, but I had ordered tow other dresses for this wedding for my daughter and me, so I rolled the dice. Thankfully it worked. This dress looks in some photos like it's a heavier embroidered texture, but it is a thinner material with the design printed on the fabric. It was great for a hot summer rehearsal dinner. The pockets were an added bonus. (34C, 25"", 36"")","August 31, 2015","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NL48","Sarah","Looks very different up close!","The fit and comfort of this dress was fantastic! There are pockets and you can easily wear a regular bra (there are even little ties on the underside of the dress straps to keep bra straps in place). This runs TTS or a little big, esp. if you have a small waist and bust for your size like I do. My only complaint was that it looked VERY different up close than I expected. For one thing, its cotton. Secondly, the print looks a little wild up close (think 80's/90's). From the photos online, it looked like the print was much more subtle and it was a fancier fabric than cotton (I thought it was a brocade). I wore the dress to the intended event (wedding) anyway, but would not rent it again for a fancy occasion. It would be awesome as a more casual BBQ/day party dress in my opinion. Nevertheless I dressed it up and made it work!","August 11, 2015","Large"

The sleeves are the showstopper feature here and are not as flowy as I was expecting. They delightfully hold their own shape and subtly command a double look. The attached velvet ribbon at wrists aren't overdone, but I do recommend double wrapping before tying the bow to avoid the strands dangling in the way. Pro-tip: A standard bra can totally be worn (praises), but the cold shoulder does come in a bit further in the back, so a strap converter (or paperclip) is handy to pull into a racerback format to avoid straps showing in the back.","January 8, 2018","Date"

I was able to go braless which was a plus, the fabric on the bust is thick enough (no bralette structure though, just lined, fyi) and adjusting how tightly you tie the neck can help keep everything in place! Length was good, if the outer sheer layer was any longer it would have been too long for the style/too much fabric in the skirt. Pleased with it but its wear is showing a bit...no longer as bright white as newer versions I'm sure (my second size was actually brighter, but did not fit...bummer!).","May 24, 2018","True to Size"

This dress was comfortable, flattering and photographed well. I did find myself adjusting the halter top quite a bit because it was digging into my neck, but that's pretty normal for a halter so I dealt with it. I would note that this dress looks pretty white in the RTR model pictures, but if you look at it compared to my husband's true-white outfit, it was more of a cream/off-white color. Just keep that in mind if you're going to a white-out party like we were (the bachelor/bachelorette party I wore it to was a white-out theme, because the groom's last name is White! So cute.)

It hugged my curves in all the right places and was very comfortable.","Like clothing for most women, my size has varied a bit from brand to brand, even in maternity clothing. I wear a dress size 4-8, which can sometimes mean a small or a medium. I ordered the small regular and medium regular, and ended up wearing the medium regular (I was 26 weeks pregnant at the time). The dress material was very comfortable and stretchy, and the off the shoulder was surprisingly not annoying. I would recommend wearing a maternity ""shaping panty"" with the dress to help avoid a visible panty line due to the tighter fit (and the extra support didn't hurt either) . I am 5 foot 7 inches and started the night in heels (okay, like 30 minutes) and then changed into sandals. The dress was the perfect length for me in flats/sandals. I would recommend wearing a strapless bra, but because of the ruffle on the top you might be able to get away without one depending on your bra size. This is a great dress at a great price, especially if you are like me and didn't have any other events or weddings that would require a more formal dress for you to purchase/re-wear while pregnant.","July 8, 2019","True to Size"

Although the fabric is a little heavier than expected, this dress is one of the most comfortable formal gowns I've ever worn and I received tons of compliments.

I was nervous because I'm closer to size 12 but it wasn't available so I went with the 10 plus lots of working out and strict nutrition for the weeks before the wedding. Dress was amazing - pair of spanx shorts underneath and I was good to go. I wear a bra 99.9% of the time and I was pretty comfortable going without. I would readjust when I went to the bathroom, but I wasn't constantly worried about it. We danced the night away and I felt amazing in it the whole night. This dress is stunning in person - it was a black tie preferred/black attire only wedding and I really felt like I stood out in a good way in all the plain black. Got tons of compliments too. Only downside - the zipper sticks at one point about halfway up. I couldn't have gotten dressed by myself. I'm 5'5"", and the dress hit the floor when I was barefoot. I wore smallish heels and it was still a good length which was nice.","April 15, 2019","Wedding"

The drawback is that having the heavy fabric to do that means the whole dress weigh a lot and it's be too warm to wear in the summer. I still loved it, but just a heads up on that. It was super comfortable all night and I would definitely think about renting again for a fall or winter event! Wore it with some modern rose gold earrings and rings. At 5'6"" I wore about a 3 inch heel and that was good to keep the dress at the right length. I think I weighed 180 or 185 at this time, and the size 12 was perfect.","March 29, 2019","True to Size"

I received so many compliments! Despite the material being thick due to its high quality, it surprisingly felt very light to wear and was very breathable. The material is very forgiving and the stretch provides adequate comfort for sitting, dancing, etc. I did not need a bra for this dress as the top provided adequate support. I'm happy I listened to the reviews about the length of the dress - even at my height, the Long length was perfect with a small 2 inch heel, I would not have wanted it any shorter. I would say this dress is true to jean size and not the typical designer sizing. The Size 14 fit fine but I opted for the 16 for a slightly less ""skin tight"" look (12 weeks pregnant and a little bloated!). It still fit like a glove, the material and cut of the dress will fit you like it's made for you! It's very slimming and figure-flattering.

I didn't wear a bra, which I was really nervous about at first. However, the sheer fabric over the cleavage made for a beautiful design without forsaking comfort, and I don't think anyone noticed. My grandparents didn't even say anything. The only downside to this dress is that it runs short, but other reviews said the same so I was prepared. I'm not wearing shoes in the photo, and it just barely brushes the ground. I opted for flats, and it worked well. I highly recommend this dress!","January 15, 2019","True to Size"

If they had one more size up I probably would have gotten it because I don't love having everything so snug; I wore a corset underneath this because I felt the shape of the dress made my tummy more prominent looking without it. Straps were a bit too long for my ""short shoulders"" and I was surprised that this was the long version - I'm 5'6 and wore maybe 2.5"" heels, and could not have worn any taller shoes without feeling like the dress was too short.

I am definitely an extra small , I typically wear zero or double zero I have a small chest and very small shoulders however I do have a rear end ! I sized up to a size small based on reviews in this thing was really tight . I would definitely size up on this one . what I think is so versatile about this dress is I planned on having bare legs with heels but my feet hurt and so I just put on solid black tights in a war somewhat casual booties and it looked fine . I really like that about the stress , also there is no need for a necklace so it makes just earrings and bracelet easy Bam you're done .

Don't bother if you are above size 8 and have hips!","My usual RTR dress size is 10 (for reference, I am 5'8"", 154 lbs, 36C) and this dress is size Large was too tight for me at the hips to wear it in public. The dress is short to start with and, as soon as I start walking, the skirt rides up in a major way. This dress is best for petite women. The top part of the dress fit okay, but despite the well-placed lace stripes, it wasn't as figure-flattering as I would have expected. Wasn't crazy about the stripe on the upper arm either. By the way, the lace stripes are backed by a nude-colored fabric, so they are not see-through. Aside from the fit issue, this is a comfortable dress to wear and I like the long sleeves for overly airconditioned restaurants.","August 31, 2018","Small"

The cut is unique without being unusual, the fabric is very lightweight so fantastic for summer. I felt that it made a great work dress even though it's a more formal fabric (I think it's chiffon), but it could also be dressed up beautifully for a wedding or other more formal event. It is a little sheer, so be careful with the undergarments you choose. It also wrinkles pretty easily, I steamed it thoroughly before wearing but in the photo taken at the end of the day you can see the wrinkles that formed from sitting at my desk. Also, before taking the picture of the back, my husband informed me that my bra was showing and he had to play with it quite a bit to get it to cover my bra for the photo. My measurements are 33-26-35 and the size 0 fit very nicely. There was some extra room so it would probably accommodate a slightly larger person, but there is no stretch.

I was able to wear a regular bra, though I did wear spanx. The skirt is more fitted than the bodice.

The back is open which I loved, but not to the point where a regular bra would show. The sleeves and ""cape"" effect added a nice touch to take the dress a little bit out of the ordinary.

While it was not what I would have picked out for myself, here are my thoughts on it for those that are knowingly renting it... the bust does run a little small, so I'd suggest sizing up if you are an average chest size or larger. Unlike other reviews, I did NOT think it was too short. I liked the length and quite frankly wouldn't have minded it to be a little shorter (I'm 5'5). You can't tell from the pictures, but I'd label this a shirt dress with buttons halfway down. If you have broad shoulders, I would NOT recommend this dress as the ruffles make it look even worse. On the upside... it is comfortable and hides any insecurities and the colors are gorgeous.","August 19, 2017","Wedding"

I have D cup size breasts and I couldn't button the dress up all the way without it doing that crazy gappy button look in the front. But on me it looked better unbuttoned anyway. It does run a tad short, so I wore tights with it (it was kinda cold in Quebec City on our trip). I also wore it without my tights in Dallas Texas for a business conference.

The other issues was when I walked with my purse on my shoulder, the rub of the purse against my leg kept pulling the skirt up. Just something to keep an eye on.

I was having to mess with it a bunch to keep the back of my bra covered by dress.

I'm small cheated but have hips and a bigger butt so i would say the only thing i didn't love is that personally i had to use double sided tape right under the arm pit area to make sure the dress didn't pull down and show my strapless bra, BUT you can wear a strapless with this which is a plus! You can also wear spanx with this just make sure the top of them are lower than the cut out in the back! This is a perfect dress for a tall girl! Great color, thick (but not too thick) material. Wore to a spring wedding. Super happy with this dress, and you will be too! Read reviews and ended up going with the medium over the small bc i was nervous the small would be too tight across my butt! Glad i went with the medium!","March 27, 2019","Wedding"

Cutout in the back adds a fun touch without showing too much skin. Wore for a work holiday party and received a ton of compliments. Feels like a stretchy sweater like material (not heavy though) and dark green color. Perfect for classy but not going plain-Jane black. My original shipment was delayed so RTR offered to overnight a duplicate order just in case the 1st never showed (great customer service!) Both ended up arriving in time and only pause was that I noticed the inside straps for hanging the dress had been cut out of the dress in the 1st order which meant the top portion was a bit stretched from hanging from only the dress neckline. Still would have been wearable but because of this I wore the 2nd, which had the internal straps for hanging and less stretched neckline so fit better vs. showing edge of bra in the 1st. Either way, both were great and very pleased!","January 27, 2019","Party"

The dark green proved a great color for a winter wedding, and the knit fabric fit in well at the casual-cocktail reception. The dress is exceptionally comfortable. I wore a strapless bra with it and would recommend seamless undies, too. I docked a star because the gap in the back is large and it was a little annoying to keep shifting it so that my bra strap didn't show. Even still. I would consider buying this dress! Size down if you're between, this is TTS with a lot of stretch and you don't want the back gap shifting too much.","January 11, 2019","True to Size"

The color is as pictured and everything else is as described. Because my chest is so small, I was able to go sans bra. Wearing a normal bra would be impossible in this because of the neckline. It does run small; normally I wear xs in everything, but I'm glad I had a small in this. It's fairly tight, especially in the midsection.

I was drawn to the color, sweater-like material, and cutout on the back. It's a nice + comfortable dress that fit me well (I am 5-7 and 115lbs and wore the XS). I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because I didn't *love* the length on me. I do not recommend this dress for anyone shorter than me... personal opinion. Also, it clung to my hips in a slightly awkward way which I didn't think was suuuper flattering. However, it did look pretty nice and I wore it without hesitation to the party. In short - I probably would not rent this dress again, but it worked very well for this party. :)","November 17, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ANR46","Courtney","Beautiful dress! Not for your 3rd trimester...","This dress arrived ready to wear as the material is stretchy and does not wrinkle easily. I ordered this dress because it was in the “maternity friendly” section and I did not want to go buy a dress for this one time I’m going to a wedding while pregnant. I tried on both the small and medium. Ladies, this is my second baby so my 6 month belly is not small. Technically, the medium dress fit comfortably. However, the adorable back cutout stretched to accommodate my belly in front and transformed into a back slit. Also, the line between the dress skirt and top sections falls right across the top portion of the belly (rather than beneath the bra line, you know how most maternity clothes do that and it’s a good look?) and that was weird too. But, it looked lovely on my sister! She has a fit build, is about 5’6 and 130lbs. She wore the small. She was very comfortable and received compliments all night. The picture is of her, and really doesn’t do her or the dress justice. She looked beautiful and for the price you can’t go wrong. Overall, great dress. You could try wearing it pregnant if you’re in that early, cute, small bump stage.","October 19, 2018","True to Size"

I wore the 6 because it was a classy affair. I did not have to wear a bra (which was nice) and because of the stretch material clinging so tight, I wore seamless underwear. The reason I gave a 4 was because of the stretch, but also because the shoulder detail was a bit flimsier than I had hoped (to be fair, I wanted to be DRUH-matic) But seriously a great dress that you can't go wrong with!","August 21, 2019","Wedding"

I got lots of compliments on it, and liked the way it fit. I also liked how comfortable it was; despite being form-fitting you don't feel like a sausage in a casing wearing the dress. I will say I wore the large and didn't try the medium on, but I wonder if I should have worn the medium as I noticed the dress stretched out a bit and the shape relaxed as the event wore on. I also ended up wearing this dress to two separate weddings, and it was definitely less form fitting on the second occasion than the first. Overall this is a great dress!","June 26, 2019","Wedding"

I'd read that this dress runs small, but it was a great fit.","I wore this dress to a friend's wedding in June in Tennessee. The ceremony was outside and the reception was indoors with a decent length walk between the two spaces, so I did notice that the dress has a little bit of a tendency to ride up when walking. The dress itself fit well and was made out of a thick enough material that I felt comfortable. I would rent this dress again.","June 20, 2019","True to Size"

The 6 fit perfect (so I recommend trusting the reviews and going one size up from usual!). Great for a Summer wedding. Loved the cutouts on the side. Very form fitting and didn't have much stretch, so if you're looking for something with more give maybe this isn't the dress for you. I actually had a hard time getting in and out of the car because I felt like it was going to rip but the size 8 looked too big.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ100","Grace","Flirty, but unforgiving and not the best fit","I've got a small chest and big hips (35-28-41, if that helps any of you), so sizing isn't always the easiest for me; while I can fit a 4 up top, I definitely cannot below the waist. With that in mind, I rented this dress in an 8 with a 10 as a backup for my birthday, and it's a good thing I did- even with shapewear, the 10 was verrrrryyyyy snug (all photos taken after I'd eaten, so not the most flattering time, hahaha) I loved the cutouts and the color, though - I paired it with the raspberry tights on a whim, and was really happy how it worked out, so I added the stole, too. Due to inclement weather, the dresses didn't arrive until a day later than planned, resulting in me getting them an hour before our reservations, which made for a very rushed time of getting ready.","January 9, 2019","Small"

I'm typically a 4 and I ended up with the 8 since the 6 fit well up top but was a little too tight to be comfortable on the bottom. It has some stretch to it and overall is a simple but show stopper dress. No need for a bra, just used a few breast petals to cover up and I was good to go.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ100","Katie","Fit like a glove!","Loved this dress! I definitely agree with other reviewers that these dresses run small, however I did end up wearing the size 2 (my backup was a size 4) because it fit me better lengthwise. The size 4 also fit and gave me room in the tummy area but it went significantly below my knees and just made it look awkwardly long on me. I have pretty small hips and basically no chest so I think that's why the smaller size fit so well. I could have worn it without a bra but went with a silicone bra for a more fitted look. Got tons of compliments! Loved the color as well. In general, I don't like to stand out in a crowd so I loved the muted purple/gray color...and it was perfect for a Florida Fall wedding.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ100","Theresa","Just okay","I was pretty disappointed with this dress. It's more stunning in photos than in person. I felt that the cut and color are very generic. Furthermore, the fabric has almost no stretch, making it difficult to sit, stand, walk, dance, or even use the restroom in this dress. I'm a true size 2, and ordered a 4 and 6 based on the reviews here. The 6 was baggy and the 4 was so tight I could barely breathe or walk. I went with the 4 because the 6 quite frankly looked awful with the cutouts hanging off and away from my body. This was an important wedding for someone very near to my heart and I didn't want to look ill-fitted. I would not rent this dress, or any other Elizabeth and James dress again. My advice is to size up, and prepare to be physically uncomfortable for as long as you have this dress on. Would not recommend.","July 16, 2018","Wedding"

The consultant did everything in her power to help me find a different dress, but I had my heart set on this one, so I kept it, and I'm so glad I did. Even though the hips were a little big, it was helpful for walking and dancing because this dress is very tight and does not have a lot of give. Walking up and down stairs was the most challenging.

No bra needed at a 32D. My details below. I'm a 25"" waist and 25-27 in jeans bc of big hips/butt. Usually wear a 2 in Elizabeth and James and I sized up to a 4 after reading the reviews but this one was still extremely tight around the hips. I think I could have worn a 6 and it would have still been tight and I would have been able to sit more comfortably. If you have big hips or a booty definitely size up 1-2 sizes. Size 4 dresses run way too large on my chest and shoulders and this one was still tight so don't worry about the top being too big if you size up.

I am short, so if I owned the dress I would've hemmed it slightly, but it wasn't noticeable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because, to me, it looked a bit faded.

I'm normally a 0-2 in a dress that has some give in the hips, or a 4-6 in a really tight one. Like the other reviews said, this runs small! The 6 was very tight getting on, and I had slightly limited mobility (getting into a cab was fun!), but the tightness is the whole point of the dress and it looked amazing!

The length for me was perfect in 3"" heels. I did require a NuBra to give my girls some lift. The material of the dress was silky and the bottom was flowy and flouncy. I loved walking in it!! The bodice does not have any give and one piece of the boning did poke me a tiny bit during the evening. For me, it was not too tight, but I do have a very small frame. Also, the train did get stepped on from time to time. All that being said, I felt like a princess in this gown. It received so many compliments that I lost count and several people told me later on that it was a 'head-turner'. I kept it simple with diamond bracelet and dangle earrings and let the dress do the rest. It worked!! Because of an issue with my 2nd dress option, Rent the Runway gave me 2 more dresses to try. I actually chose one of those to wear to the wedding. This was my 3rd choice and ended up being THE ONE! I highly recommend!!","October 8, 2018","True to Size"

The 2L length was perfect on me (I'm 5'8"" and wearing 2.5"" heels). The shapely silhouette of this dress for better or worse will accentuate any curves and it fit me like a glove. The side bow adds just a little touch of something different but not obnoxiously so and it's not as obvious as it seems in the RTR photos of this dress.

With 4 inch heels, the dress lightly feathered the ground. It was perfect. I got compliments all night! The inside is a bit warn and the wiring had started to come out. It was stabbing me a bit in the chest which I was fiddling with all night. But a simple tissue or cotton ball can fix that. Keep in mind this is a snug dress so bending over is a challenge but it certainly kept my posture on point.

I didn’t need to wear a bra - usually this leaves me feeling a bit exposed, but the cut of the dress gave me enough coverage to feel very comfortable and supported. Fabric was top notch - thick with some give, traveled well (didn’t need any steaming after a 2 hour flight in the RTR bag).

Super cute dress, very comfy and stretchy material. It fit more like a midi skirt on me, but it could easily fall at knee length if you're taller.

This dress allowed me to do all of that (without having to constantly adjust anything), and still look/feel amazing. I received a ton of compliments from people I did not even know. The dress just has an eye-catching effect - it is unexpected with the criss-cross neckline and unique print/coloring (off-white with dark blue print...can look black in some pics, but it is definitely blue!). Sizing - I am a typical size 4-6 and the small worked well. The material had some stretch, but not a lot. It is also thicker so would hesitate for an outdoor event if temps are high. I wore a strapless bra (more for shape than support reasons) with no issues. I highly recommend!","July 3, 2018","True to Size"

Everyone loved it on me and I loved it as well!","I am 5'10"" with really long legs and a small chest so smock-like dresses work really well for me. If you have a shorter, more stout figure or short legs, I DO NOT recommend this dress. It is small and fitted around the shoulder area and then is very much a ""sack""-like shape with lots of fabric. Again, LONG LEGS and FLATTER CHESTS will flatter this dress mostly. I personally loved the dress and got SO many compliments on it, but if you have never tried this style before/aren't already comfortable with it, then I do not recommend. Also, I normally wear an 8 or 10 and ordered a 6 after reading the comments about the excess fabric and they were right! Order a size down as your back-up size!","January 22, 2018","Large"

As other people mentioned, it was definitely tight across the chest. I spent $400 at Macy’s the morning of the wedding buying 6 different bodysuits to go underneath that would help minimize my chest, and not give me the pulling look across the top.

I wore it to an Oscar viewing party charitable event and felt like a million dollars. There is stretch to it, but the side zip might make it too tight if you're larger than a 36 C. I was able to wear a regular bra (a minimalist demi type) and was able to keep the straps in place with a little Hollywood tape. It was the perfect length for me. I'm 5'10"" and it hit me mid calf. So if you're shorter than that, it might end up being full length. Although being head to toe in sequins, the dress was super soft and comfortable to wear. The lining was substantial so it was flattering and hugged you in all the right places while hiding those less than perfect areas. The color was beautiful. The sequins were more of a deep gunmetal gray than black. I wish I could wear this dress again and again.

The dress had a hole in the seam, but it wasn't noticeable & I notified RTR & they offered to overnight me a dress. I didn't have to wear any type of bra due to the dress being fitted in that area. Lots of cleavage, so beware if you are a little modest. The skirt part of the dress is very flattering and the lace in the back and side adds a little sexiness without being over the top.

While the main part of the dress fits true to size (I usually wear size 12 and ordered this dress in size 12), the chest area is way too tight. I couldn't fit my C-cup breasts into this dress. They were pushed in and were trying to come out at the armpit area. Not a pretty sight! Also, the dress is very short. Otherwise, it is a beautiful and well-made dress. The fabric is heavy and feels like brocade. It would look great on a petite person without big chest. I might give it another try with a larger size.","October 27, 2017","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM264","RTR Customer","Loved and hated...","I loved the color of the dress,but it fit oddly on me. The lower part (waist, hips) fit perfect, but the top (shoulder straps, bodice) were off. The shoulder straps slid off all night so I kept having to adjust them. The plunge in the front was too much for my cleavage. There was barely enough time fabric to cover my nipples. The dress had inadequate coverage for the breasts. I tried pasties, taping, a u-plunge stick on bra...nothing worked so I ended up wearing a black bustier bra with it. It turned out okay but I wish I had ordered a different dress. I will definitely order again and read the reviews carefully.","September 30, 2018","Wedding"

My ONLY issue is that you can't wear a bra without it being seen, and unfortunately that's just a nuisance for me. My boobs are sad after having a child and breastfeeding, so I had to wear one, and it showed. If you have small or perky boobs, this is the dress for you. If I get a boob job, I'm ordering this dress again. Ha!","September 27, 2018","Formal Affair"

It was very flattering & easy to dance in! I rented my usual size 4 for this dress, and got a size 6 backup, but wished I'd gotten the size 2 backup.

I'm a 34DD so it might work better on less busty types, but I imagine that would also make the side boob worse (though you could pair it with a cardigan or jacket to remedy that).

I was a little nervous about the neck being too tight, but it wasn't restricting at all. Loved the length - I'm 5'3 and wanted a shorter dress - this delivered! The lace is soft and really beautiful.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RZ59","Sarah","This Dress made me feel like a Million Bucks!","I rented both the 4 and 6 as every dress is different. I am easily both sizes in everyday clothes. I tried the 4 on first and didn't even bother trying the 6 on after I had the 4 on! It fit perfectly in every area. It hugged all the right curves and was just loose enough in the tummy area to hang perfectly over my not so perfect stomach because it is a shift dress. I could see how people could say it runs big if they are looking for a bit more of a tighter fit. I probably could have worn a 2 had I rented that size and tried it on, but I am sure that it would have been much tighter and not looked the way I wanted it to. The little cap sleeves were perfect to hide any imperfect little arm pooch (you know what i'm talking about if you have one like me). The length showed off my legs without being too revealing or short. I am 5'3"" though, so if you are taller, it will obviously be shorter. I was able to wear a regular nude colored bra and it didn't show because the lace is closely woven. I was the only one in a red dress in a sea of black dresses, and I received sooo many compliments.

Some notes about the fit - it was true to size for me but fit a little on the tighter side. I needed help getting the zipper up as well. The cut looks great, but it's definitely a bit tighter around the legs, so I wouldn't plan for much dancing in it.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YK39","RTR Customer","Great for a summer wedding!","This dress is perfect for a summer wedding. This dress was actually the back-up dress for my order and since this one fit in addition to my main dress, I wore this to the church and the other dress to the reception. The length of this dress makes it dressy while still being appropriate and it was comfortable. The fit is true to size and I liked that the dress is form-fitting, but not skin tight. The lace adds some great texture and can hide any imperfections in the belly area that you may be concerned about. I'm small chested, but still feel like I needed to wear a strapless bra with this dress and there was definitely enough room in the top part for that. I paired this dress with a 2-3 inch heel and I think that made the length more flattering on my short figure. I definitely recommend this for any kind of spring or summer wedding or other formal occasion. Would rent again!","June 30, 2019","True to Size"

The only reason I can't give it five stars is because the dress would shift violently to the right even after taking a few steps. So...try dancing in it. By the end of the night I was getting pretty annoyed and couldn't wait to take it off. I don't remember reading that anyone else had this problem so maybe it was this particular dress(?).

I was even willing to wear one with straps that showed through the lace at the top, but in the end I opted to go braless (not my favorite move) and use some fashion tape to secure the girls. I was a little worried about under-boob showing, but the 8 fit snugly enough that I made it through the night without any incidents. Very beautiful dress, classy with a unique flair.

The only thing that takes away a star for me is that it twisted sort of throughout the night so the stitching looked off. No one would notice though. Also, the sleeves have no stretch so reaching up was a little limited but not a deal breaker at all.

The fabric is a richly re-embroidered lace and reads a deep red. It is lined across the bust and from the waist to the hem. The hint of skin was appropriately sexy for the occasion (family wedding) and my age (58). I wore a strapless bra to give me some shape but it could easily be worn without a bra. It fit me perfectly- skimmed over the body. The hem hit just below my knee cap (I am 5'5""). The slit in the back made walking easily but climbing into my sister's SUV required a bit of finesse. I deducted a star because the lining in the front drooped a good 1-1.5"" below the dress. I had to temporarily hem it so it wouldn't show.

I did use some very light shapewear (shorts) to smooth a little in the love handle region but it really would've been fine without it. Recommend with nude heels and yellow gold jewelry!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ175","Natalya","Enjoying this sunny dress in the sunshine!","It is a tighter fit than most size 4 dresses I've tried but I was able to fit in without spandex. For reference my waist is about 27"". I would have worn spandex if it wasn't so warm outside because it did show all my lumps and bumps. What is hard to see in the photos is there are visible yellow thread stitches on the front side, which doesn't look as elegant, but it's fine, can't see it on photos but personal preference is that they are not there... It was nice for a sunny summer date night. I would say if other size 4 dresses such as LK Bennett, Reiss, Elie Tahari are tight on you, get a size 6 instead. Putting it on also be sure not to have full face makeup on because the yellow straps on top rub against your face when putting on. Thankfully I read this tip from another reviewer and didn't put on makeup until after I put on the dress and saved myself the hassle of washing off any makeup transfer :)","July 23, 2018","Small"

I typically wear a 6, but I felt drowned in the 6, so I wore the back up size which was a 4. The dress is beautiful, the silhouette is beautiful. The only cons were that the lining neckline was not secured down so it kept coming unfolded. That piece of lining is about an inch or 2 thick and runs around the entire neckline and the V shape of the back of the dress. I tried everything to secure it down, safety pins, pressing it- even duck tape- nothing worked, but it wasn’t that noticeable, just annoying. If the dress were mine, I would’ve used hemming tape or took it to the tailor. Only other issue was a small area of “pilling” on the front of the dress- again hardly noticeable.

I wore it to a black tie optional wedding and felt perfect (not too much - not underdressed). I would definitely rent it again.","December 5, 2018","Small"

I'm 5'9"" and wore 3"" heals and the dress hit right at the top of my foot.. the only thing I really didn't like was the weird gathering in the bust area, but it was most likely due to the fact that I didn't fill out the top at all...

I would not recommend this dress if you were looking to dance that night, but for photos it was great and I felt so classy and beautiful in it. I have a 25"" waist and 34"" bust and I would have preferred a tighter fight in the bodice up top, but it wasn't too bad. Highly recommend fashion tape, something I didn't buy, that would help you feel more secure and avoid a slip. The neckline on this dress is just gorgeous. The fabric doesn't wrinkle which is good because I was in the car driving in this dress for about 2 hours before the event and when we arrived the dress still looked perfect. I would say overall the fabric is pretty forgiving but Spanx are never a bad idea. The fabric is medium weight so you won't overheat and moves pretty well.","February 25, 2019","True to Size"

I read a ton of reviews on it and looked for my body type and settled on the Small and XSmall. I'm a 120, 5,5"" and a small 34b. The small fit perfect except that it was way too big in the boobs. I couldn't go without a bra without the fear of people just plainly seeing my boobs because of the boning shape. It's just shaped in a way that's meant for a larger B or C I would say. Had I been big enough I could go without a bra no problem. The boning in the corset/waist area definitely kept the dress up so no fear of it falling. I ended up having to safety pin the front so you couldn't see my bra so I'd suggest a low cut plunging bra if you feel the need to wear one! The fabric is super pretty nice and flowy.

The boning along the corset keeps anything from moving, although I definitely could have had a nip slip if my arms were in the air. I did wear probably 4"" heels, and with those the bottom of the dress just brushed the ground. This dress is probably a little revealing for the more well-endowed among us, but my girls had plenty of breathing room so I would think up to a small DD would be able to make it work. Fabric isn't too thin or thick, color is beautiful, and it's well made. Never had to tug it up or readjust, and the cut made my waist look nonexistent.","January 30, 2019","Formal Affair"

I'm 5'7"" and wore 3"" in heels so the dress just barely skimmed the floor which was perfect for dancing. Also the skirt part of the dress fell over my legs/butt nicely, which is sometimes an issue as I have thick thighs. The top part of the dress has boning that curves with the boobs, so I had to wear my most padded bra (I'm a 32 C and could't fill the cups on my own) and used pins and fashion tape . Also the top part was a little loose around my rib cage so I pinned the inside to make it a bit tighter which worked perfectly. The top was then tight enough that I didn't need to keep pulling it up all night. I am narrower on top so it may not be an issue for someone who wears a 34/36 bra.

The boning in the torso area keeps the dress sitting in just the right place all night- no worrying about your dress falling down when you move or dance. Given the low cut and high slit, it was surprisingly forgiving and allowed me to dance and eat a ton at the wedding reception. No need to wear a bra or nipple covers. The top can be a bit uncomfortable when sitting - unless you're sitting stick straight!","October 26, 2018","Wedding"

I wouldn't recommend this dress if you have a larger bust. I am smaller up top and I was able to not wear anything underneath and it didn't budge but if you're larger it might be a problem. The cleavage exposure is the only reason I gave it four stars. It's still classy but it was a little more than I typically like to show. Other than that the dress was a huge win. I got compliments all night. Wish I could have kept this one.","October 17, 2018","Formal Affair"

The material didn't have much give and the torso was kind of uncomfortable. Dress ran small and I had to size up for the large. Also, even the regular was super long and dragged slightly with 4 inch heels. Not able to wear a regular strapless bra due to how low cut the front is.","October 6, 2018","Formal Affair"

It made me feel so classy, but was EXTREMELY comfortable at the same time. I paired it with a thin belt, heels, and gold jewelry. The material is great and so flattering! Arms are not restricted at all. Only downside - I wish I had gotten the long, as the regular was pretty short to wear with any normal heels. I ended up wearing kitten heels, and even that was almost pushing it. For flats, length would have been perfect. Overall, would HIGHLY recommend for any event!!!","June 27, 2019","True to Size"

It does fit a bit snug in the tummy area, so keep that in mind. I'm very small on top didn't need a bra, just stick-on petals for modesty. The fabric is thick so even if your chest is larger you still could go bra-less. I'm 5'7 and wore the 4L with 3in heels. You couldn't even see my feet, but I liked how it looked. The regular length would've been too short with high heels. I received SO many compliments all night long! The zipper was a bit tight, but I had help in the restroom getting it down. A bit awkward using the restroom since you have to drop the entire thing and basically sit there naked. Haha. Would wear this over and over again if I could. I paired it with the rose gold Kate Spade purse which I wore as a crossbody, which made for a very comfy evening.","January 19, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM470","Emily","A jumpsuit that ACTUALLY worked for a tall girl!","I have issues with jumpsuits: I'm usually too tall for their length, and the torsos typically are also too short for me to wear without them riding up all night. But this was brilliant and I loved it so much! If you have torso issues with jumpsuits too, size up! I rented the 12 because of this, and had almost no issues all night. I wore it for a work event at TopGolf, and I could freely swing a club without problem even with the off the shoulder sleeves. I also didn't have issues with the zipper like a lot of people; it zipped right up for me without help! I didn't wear a bra, and I don't think one is needed. The material is thick, plus the loose layer over the chest hides any indication of not wearing a bra. You could definitely wear strapless with this if you wanted though! My one issue was the length. Tall ladies, don't order the regular. I rented the long, but it was unfortunately unavailable at the last minute. You can see in the photo that the 12R was sort of like wearing high waters, but no one really noticed. If I had the long length, it would have been 100% perfect. Otherwise, this jumpsuit was great! High quality fabric, super comfortable, and is something I will definitely be renting again!","October 17, 2018","Small"

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this jumpsuit so you should wear nubra or no bra since there is an open shoulder section in the back. At 5’6”, the length hit to my ankles. Pair with nude and silver heels and fun earrings to complete your outfit!","August 9, 2018","True to Size"

The ruffles make it hard to wear a statement necklace, so I opted for statement earrings and a bracelet. Fit was great and the inseam was long enough for me to wear strappy wedges. Only issue was I struggled with the back zipper where the top ruffle meets the pants. And when you wear a jumpsuit, you have to unzip everything to use the loo, so it was a dicey situation. Happy to report no zipper malfunctions, though.","May 17, 2018","True to Size"

It is very low cut in the front so if this is something you aren't comfortable with then this isn't the rental for you. The back is also open so you can't wear a traditional bra. If you have a small chest like me you can get away with no bra at all which I always love. My fiancé loved it and I received tons of compliments while out for dinner.

I would 100% buy this jumpsuit to wear to any event. The Long was definitely long, as I am 5'6 and wore 3.5"" heels, and it was still dragging a bit. The only drawback I found, was that it is very difficult to tie the back by myself, as the arms were very tight, with no elasticity - so make sure you bring a friend to the bathroom!","October 18, 2018","True to Size"

This jumpsuit is so cute and for the most part, comfortable! Cons: -The sleeves are a little tight without much stretch to the fabric (and by all means I do not have muscular arms). -I also have a smaller bust and eas very apprehensive at the low open front being too revealing, it was an easy fix with sticky bra and dress tape!","January 22, 2018","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF13","RTR Customer","This color is everything!","Everything about this outfit is gorgeous. The lace is pretty, color is amazing and the fit was just wonderful. There is absolutely no give in this garment so if you are concerned at all I would size up. The long was super long, I'm almost 5'8"" and with 3 inch heels on it was still dragging the ground. I'm quite certain the regular wouldn't have worked so I was still happy with the length. The reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because you really have to go with nothing on the girls other than maybe a nipple cover. I bought tape and was prepared to do a Kim K tape job but since the whole front and back are lace other than the sections over the girl itself, there isn't anywhere to even put tape. If you are a smaller busted person then probably no problem but I would beware they might fly out at any moment - no support at all, especially to bend or move (like dancing). Still in the end I went with a nude cami and I was happy. Tons of compliments!!!!","November 12, 2017","Wedding"

You definitely can't wear a bra with this jumpsuit, so it didn't really work out well for me (that's why you can see my bra poking out a little) but it would work much better for someone who can go braless! The Regular was the perfect length with about 3"" heels and the fabric doesn't have any stretch.","October 30, 2017","True to Size"

I think I was between sizes--the xs was a little snug on my arms and bottom but the small was too long and a little loose. You must tie the back very tightly otherwise the material will gape. It's definitely plunging and requires either a very low back bra or adhesive cups. I got a lot of compliments. It's a beautiful color.

I was worried about the other reviews with the arms not being able to move, its true, but it really wasnt bothersome at all. Its worth the trouble, just make sure you have someone follow you to the bathroom. This runs big, I couldve sized down and its extremely long, even with my giant chunky heels it was still too long. Got tons of compliments. Its great for girls with bigger thighs too!","October 30, 2019","Large"

Unfortunately I have a small chest and broad shoulders, and that combo simply does not seem to work with this dress. If the armpit area had been bigger I might have been able to fix the gaping at the chest. But if I went up a size, even though the arms would have fit, it would be even bigger on my chest and not fit the rest of my body. Pity, as the color was great and it was very comfortable.","September 4, 2019","Vacation"

The dress was tight, thick material with about 4 layers to zip up with a fragile zipper (sturdy- but very fine). The bust was TIGHT!! I am a D and should have headed the other review warnings. The other bridesmaids had to get me into this because the last two inches of the zipper were hell (thank god they did get me in it and I could breathe)! If I had gone up in size, the rest of the dress would have been too big and still may not have fit my bust.

Running small with some stretch, I recommend wearing a size up for your primary size This style is roomy throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works best for A-C cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this gown so you should wear a strapless bra or no bra since it is a strapless dress that features a built in bodice for support. At 5’5, it was floor length on me. This dress is absolutely lovely and is beautiful in color. Pair with heels and a statement necklace to complete your outfit!","March 7, 2019","Small"

I'd agree with the other reviewers that the bodice is more sparkly than the RTR photograph lets on. It fits great if you're a little larger up top.

My first choice didn't work at all and Alli at RTR was awesome and patient over the phone as I picked out this dress the day before our event. The dress arrived just in time, too.

The fabric was pretty forgiving, but I still wore spandex underneath. The body was fitted in a nice way and didn't ride up a ton, but the top was very weird. It was structured in the chest near my rib cage but the top and sleeves were so big and awkward! I definitely had to wear a bra to fill it out a bit, but I had to adjust a lot throughout the night to not show too much skin, and the sleeves were baggy. A lot of reviews said to size up, but the 10 was unbelievably big in the top so I'd just keep that in mind!","July 23, 2019","Wedding"

The body fit nicely but clearly made for a woman with more curvy hips. I have a pretty straight body and so it was just baggy in the hips. I still received lots of compliments and it was comfortable enough, I was just a little disappointed.","May 6, 2019","Wedding"

The fit: this dress runs true to size! I ordered it in the 2 and the 4 and ended up wearing the 4 just to be a little more conservative. The 2 also fit, but just was a little tighter at the bottom. Even with 4"" heels, I never felt like I needed to pull it down because it was too short. I'm smaller chested and never had to worry about the stop falling down because my arms held it up. I had no problem raising my arms to dance either (I hate when off the shoulder dresses do that). The fabric: the color is absolutely stunning! I received a ton of compliments on the color alone. The fabric is thick enough to hide anything you may feel insecure about - I didn't even feel the need to wear spanx! If this is a dress that you're considering... do it!

It was sexy, stylish, and classic all at the same time! The color was fabulous! I wore a strapless bra and my spanxx beneath the dress-- just to smooth things out & make sure I had support if I decided to dance. (I personally would not recommend going without a bra if you are a busty girl.) The shoulder ruffles were great for covering up any not-so-toned arms & I wore them up on my shoulders (vs. off the shoulders or even strapless) to ward off anyone being able to see straight down my ""shirt""--which was definitely possible when I had it off the shoulder. The one CON was the boning! UGH. Its a catch 22 because the boning in front & back helps you feel secure, but I guess because the dress is a bit worn, the boning pokes at you.

The top runs large, so I wore a strapless bra to help with the fit. The dress itself has thick fabric and boning so you could probably get away with not wearing a bra at all! I wore it to a beach wedding in July so it was pretty warm outside for the ceremony - a great dress for a fall or indoor event. Overall, I would definitely recommend renting this dress!","July 9, 2018","Wedding"

The color is a bit more pink than it looks in photos, but as someone who usually wears black or gray I was actually glad about that. This dress definitely benefitted from wearing some shapewear underneath just to make sure everything stayed looking smooth.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works best for A-C cup. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a strapless bra, nubra or no bra due to the cut of the dress. At 5'0"", the length was little long on me. The style of dress was sleek and the ruffles added flair. Pair with strappy heels and statement accessory to complete your outfit!","April 15, 2018","True to Size"

The fabric is preppy and the prettiest of blues making it perfect for a spring time event. I had no issue wearing a regular strapless bra (although the RTR description recommends a nubra/no bra).

I usually wear a size 6, but I am wearing a 4 in this picture and found it still very roomy. The white stripe on the bottom hit halfway down across my butt, like a drop waist.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FK8","RTR Customer","Very nice dress","I'm 5'4 140lbs, normally I wear a small, but I ordered medium and large because of the reviews. The zipper in the back doesn't have a clasp at the top, so if it's even a little bit tight, and you bend over, it will just unzip itself and literally fall right off of you. I had to wear the large size because while moving around in it, it unzipped and I was left half naked! The bottom of the dress is also not elastic, so it feels pretty baggy. Other than that, I received many compliments about the dress. It was heavy and felt like it was expensive.","June 27, 2018","Wedding"

This time was no different. I thought the length of this dress was perfect and the color was very appropriate for a fall (mid-September) wedding. I ordered a small and a medium just in case as I have gained weight over the last couple of years. I ended up wearing the small (I'm usually a 4) as usual and the fit was perfect and I didn't have to wear a bra (I'm a 34B). I received so many compliments in this dress. I will say that the comments regarding the sleeves true as expected. Throughout the night I had to constantly readjust the off-the-shoulder sleeves which was a bit annoying. I probably would stay away from something like this for an event that requires a lot of arm/shoulder motions ie dancing. Other than that I loved the dress and will be ordering from RTR for my next wedding in October!","May 9, 2018","True to Size"

The back is a full zipper from bottom to top and bunches at the back if you're a short girl like me but if you don't wear a bra or undershirt it's minimized. The sholders are not dance friendly but so gorgeous otherwise, I didn't care. I did break out a bit on my chest where it crosses, don't know if it was the friction or the dry cleaning chemicals or something else. I have very sensitive skin so I don't blame the dress to much.

The reason I tried RTR is because I'm 3 months pregnant (you may see a slight pooch in my picture), but I'm not really showing yet and no one really knows. I typically wear a size 4 or 27 in pants and I'm slightly pear shaped. I loved that I received two sizes since I'm at that point where some days my normal clothes fit great and other days they're a bit too tight. In the end, I wore the size small because the medium was a bit longer on me, a bit too big in the bust, and didn't fit overall as well as the size small. This was a great dress. Only thing, in the pictures to rent the dress it appeared to me to be a maroon color. In truth it is an eggplant purple.","September 13, 2017","Wedding"

I would have expected a bit more support/structure in the bust of the top considering it's called a 'bustier' top, but that wasn't a dealbreaker, just something to note. My biggest complaint is the strap design. It's unique, but is not practical—the straps are adjustable with D-rings at the back and the spare strap dangles down the back—but the D-rings don't hold the strap securely and so the dangling length of the straps gradually but continually slide through. I was constantly adjusting and pulling them until I finally just tied the long ends of the straps in the back together.","April 11, 2018",""

It was comfortable and didn't require a bra. That being said the 6 was big on me-- mostly in the bust section, but could have felt better if it was a tad more snug all around. I thought I rented the 6 and 8, so I wore the 6 without checking. Turns out I ordered the 6 and the 4 (duh). Should have worn the 4! But highly recommend!

I was a bit hesitant on ordering a dress online since it's often a big risk, but I'm glad I took the leap because the process was simple and the dress exceeded my expectations! I am a small individual so I was scared the dress would be too long, but the length was perfect with my 2 inch heels! I had to use safety pins because I have an extremely small chest, but that was not a huge problem.

The dress is lovely and flowy, and it's a true wrap dress, so if you're wearing this somewhere windy - BE CAREFUL I also ended up loving the high-low hem, which was just high enough in the front to not seem too dowdy. The skirt portion is lined, but the top is not. If you tie the waist tight enough, there shouldn't be too much gapping at the bust, but you will have to watch out for it loosening over the course of the event and blousing open. And with any wrap dress, you'll want to be aware of the skirt, as it too had a tendency to open quite high on the leg if not watched.","May 6, 2019","Large"

However, it's comfortable and others will not notice the wear of the garment. I wore Spanx because of my belly pooch but only because I wanted too. The pattern does forgive some flaws. I'm small chested and didn't need to wear a bra because of the light shelf bra inside. I just added swimsuit bra cups to hide the nips. Overall, it felt sassy and perfect for a Summer party.","August 5, 2018","Party"

Material is super stretchy and the mr fit great and was so comfortable at 33 weeks pregnant (+30 pounds). I'm sure it would be great for non preggies too. The material is kind of a knit jersey so makes it a little less formal, but the ruffle at the hem makes it more so - imo it's fine for a dressy day event or wedding.","July 23, 2018","Party"

Running true to size, it's a very stretchy and comfortable fabric. This style is fitted throughout the entire dress. It works for all cup sizes but you will need to wear a strapless bra because of the off shoulder sleeves. At 5'3 the length hit knee length on my left leg and tea length on my right leg. I love the asymmetric hem its so pretty and the off shoulder style is my favorite.

But, because the material looks that way, it still gives the impression that it is gathered which makes it more flattering.

The ruching, the mismatched lines, the texture-- it is all just a print on an otherwise ""flat"" jersey fabric. I was hoping the material was thicker and that the ruching was real, but overall I still enjoyed this dress. My fiance in particular thought it looked great! It is definitely form-fitting, but the print at least disguises any bumps or lines. The neckline is fun, and despite the tight fit, the dress overall is very comfortable. It's definitely more on the nice side of casual, but it's great for spring-to-summer transition weather. I paired it with a jean jacket to dress it down for a dinner out with friends. I particularly loved the frilly hemline! Even though it's not what I expected, I look forward to wearing it again before this month of Update runs out.","May 19, 2019","True to Size"

It wasn't really a surprise to me. I'm small chested. The fabric is thick enough to hide most lumps and bumps, but beware the underwear lines. Motion is slightly restricted by arm bands, but you can do everything you'd expect to do at a black tie sit down dinner. No football throwing, but you're not completely useless.

I'm short and the length was just right to keep it classy when sitting. Does require either wearing a sticky bra or going bra-less. I opted for the sticky bra to give the front a little more shape, as the dress material is chiffon and has no built-in structure. However, I did have to doctor the halter strap a bit and overlap the two ends and secure with a pin behind my neck. Otherwise it was waaaaay too loose/droopy on top. Yanking up the straps help eliminate some of that gap. Overall. I would say this dress might be best for straight or hourglass figures and probably good for chest-ier gals. Bodice might be too loose on flatter tops.","July 1, 2019","True to Size"

I loved the color of this dress and felt great in it. The S fit my hips well, but the top and straps were a bit big, though nothing that fashion tape and some safety pins couldn't handle. It might have looked slightly better if I wore shapewear but I wanted to eat, drink, dance and be comfortable and I felt it was still pretty flattering overall.","November 12, 2018","True to Size"

It may be better for slightly bigger busted women since the top area was a tad bit loose in the armpit area (I'm a 34D) but it wasn't super noticeable. The only downside to this dress was the black straps used for hanging on the hanger kept coming out and obviously I'm not allowed to cut those suckers off.

I sized up for my backup and I'm so glad I did as the material had no stretch and while the Medium fit, I felt i was just a tad too tight in the tummy area to be comfortable all night. As everyone has mentioned the top is large, but I fixed this by hooking the clasp behind the neck about an inch closer together - it made a huge difference.

I wore lace panties and you could see the pattern through the fabric. The ties on the shoulders kept sliding off. I suggest spanx or a faja for anyone over a size 2.

Otherwise the 0 fit me like a glove. Not the most comfortable for dancing though... the fabric is not stretchy at all, and the shoulders (due to the ruffles) will make lifting your arms up a little tight. Overall a gorgeous, fun dress.

I packed the size 2 after trying it on briefly before we caught our flight. It was both classy and flattering. I loved the length and the lace patterning. It also was a great material for the evening summer temperature in the 60s. However, when I put the dress on for the night, I did notice there was a black stain on the lace overlay portion of the dress. I was instantly bothered despite it being tiny because I knew it was there and I didn't pack the size 4 as a backup. I tried a tide pen and a tide wipe and neither took the stain out. I have rented dresses before with RTR and never had this problem. I will be hesitant to rent again after that incident though.

The wedding was unseasonably warm, so I was a bit hot until the sun started to drop. Fortunately I didn't have to wait long. It was a gorgeous dress and I was comfortable when the weather hit around mid 70s, until I started dancing. I also have broad shoulders, so the fit was a bit tight and I had to size up. This dress is pretty versatile and can be dressed up or dressed down. I wore strappy sandals so I didn't feel too dressy. It feels slighly heavy so I wouldn't suggest this dress for a summer outdoor wedding - it's much better suited for when the temperature is around 60-78 degrees F.","June 11, 2018","Small"

You just have to zip up the bottom zipper, which is wayyyy better than undoing the entire dress.

It was very flattering-- I've been self conscious about my lack of time to workout, but it made my mid section look great. I did have to size up. I'm normally a 4, but like all the other reviews are saying, it's right in the rib cage area. It was perfectly comfortable, though, once I put on my (larger) backup size 6.

As you'll see in the other reviews, some people think the bust runs really large while others think it runs small. I rented the 4 and the 6. The 4 was incredibly tight in the bust while the 6 was slightly too large for me in the bust. So this is clearly where the divide in fit takes place. I think size 4 and below would be great for average to small busts, while size 6 and above requires you to be pretty large up top.","September 10, 2018","Small"

First, the upper portion of the dress acts like a corset. It's VERY tight (warning to those ladies with bigger busts like C cup +: you cannot wear a bra). I couldn't wear a bra and my ladies were pushed out almost all the way to my neck! Not very appropriate for a graduation with friends and family. As mentioned from other reviewers, theres wires along the upper portion that just STAB you. Fortunately, I was able to fix it by taping some cotton balls along the side, but it definitely wasn't comfortable. Overall, the dress was cute and fun, but not comfortable to wear for long hours.","December 18, 2017","True to Size"

I am a huge fan of spanx so I did wear them to accentuate my hourglass shape but smooth out bulges. The layered slip and lace dress occasionally didn't match up, where the slip was hanging lower but it was an easy fix. I am 5'9"" so I had to be mindful of the mini-dress factor. Some may think the dress feels too short but with opaque tights it seemed fine to me. Color and neckline were my favorite features.","December 24, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM259","Jenny","Beautiful fabric, tiny waist, loose straps, can't wear a bra with it","I thought the fabric was beautiful - I loved the weight of it (thick fabric) and I think it would hold its shape well. However, the waist was really tiny so I had to size up to be able to get it to zip, but then the straps were too long. I think if I had worn it, they would have been falling down all night. Also, it's very low in the back and the straps are wide-set, so you wouldn't be able to wear any standard bra without it showing significantly. I'm pretty big busted and when I tried it without a bra since it was showing so much in the back, there was absolutely no support since the straps were so loose. I think I would have had some major mishaps if I had tried to dance it in. Overall, I thought it was beautiful, and cute from the front, but the bra issue was a deal breaker for me. If you have a small waist and can go without a bra, I think this dress could be a good option.","March 4, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM259","RTR Customer","Absolutely gorgeous!","After reading the reviews I decided to get a size 2 and it fit me really well. I wore a Nu Bra as the back is a bit low and it fit just perfect and closing the zipper was easy. I believe for very busty women it could feel a little tight. Got a lot of compliments and felt fabulous! The fabric is thick so it was perfect for a fall night.","October 22, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM259","RTR Customer","Felt fun and fabulous in this dress!","I listed it as “runs small” because I am normally a 00 and this being a 0 fit like a glove, if not a little snug. I have a small chest (34A) and am 5’0 so the dress was just perfect for me. It was gorgeous and I felt fabulous in it. It was super low cut. In the picture you can see the lace detail around my bust is actually the bra I wore underneath it. I loved the pockets and the colors were fabulous for a fall wedding!","October 10, 2018","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM259","RTR Customer","So many compliments!","This dress is gorgeous. The navy blue satin is pretty matte (more-so than I was expecting) but the pops of color from the flowers really liven it up. It is very small at the waist-- I'm normally a 4 but had to wear a six in this dress. Also, if you have a short torso, the straps are a bit long. They slipped down my shoulders a bit throughout the night. The dress also has pockets!","September 26, 2018","Wedding"

I am 5'3 130# and wore the size 4. I have a short torso so the dress grazed my knees-- perfect length. I paired it with black suede Rockport pumps = overall I felt like a model; albeit a short model lol =) highly recommend!","September 25, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM259","Erin","Beautiful pattern and fabric, perfect for an early fall wedding","I have a large ribcage and hardly no chest, so I went with the four which was a little tight around the waist and a little big at the top. Because the back dips down low, I couldn't wear a strapless bra with it. Still, the dress has a great silhouette and beautiful colors. The fabric is so thick and nice, and the pockets meant that I was able to keep my phone handy to snap pics on the dance floor. This dress was great, and I got a lot of compliments on it, it definitely stood out in a good way :) not distracting, just very nice!","September 20, 2018","Wedding"

The colors of the fall event were wine, plum, and navy- perfect for this beautiful dress. She added a bralette as the Low cut back and dip in front were too revealing for her. The dress had great built in strap clips that kept it all in place. Add maroon chucks and she had a blast!","September 19, 2018","Wedding"

I got so many compliments throughout the night, and I am very pleased with the colors any fit. It was a little loose in the bust for me (I'm almost pancake flat), but it's nothing that some fashion tape can't fix. The back is just a little bit too low for a bra.

The size 10 fit perfectly and I did not wear a bra (I'm a 36C) which was great cause both the front and back are lower than expected. The fabric is thick and textured enough that I wasn't worried about nipping out either which was awesome. I wore this dress all night and danced like crazy, it was comfortable the whole time!","August 30, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM259","RTR Customer","Loved this dress!","I found this dress very flattering! It's pretty true to size. It was a little tight around my ribs, but it wasn't unbearable. I wore it for 8 hours, and I felt fine. The neckline is low enough to show some cleavage, but no too low that it feels revealing. I was able to wear it without a bra, because the fabric is thick enough. I loved that the back is open. The length was nice, and the skirt was full enough to twirl, but did not feel cumbersome. I would highly recommend!","August 26, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM259","Elizabeth","Perfect and flattering fit!","This dress was a perfect fit for me and was flattering for my petite frame. It definitely was very form fitting the the rib and bust area and not too low cut, which I was slightly worried about from some previous reviews. I also loved that it had pockets! It was a very fun option for an indoor summer wedding. My only advice would be to get a back up size in the next size up in case it is too tight in the rib/bust area.","July 23, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM259","Coley","Awesome fit","Loved this dress! It is thick, double lined and looks classy. Definitely a color that would look good all year round. I wasn't able to wear a bra with it because of the lower cut in the front and back but the material made it easy to go bra-less. I would say it is true to size, it's cinches in the rib cage and flares out at the stomach so it would be a good cut for women if their stomach was their trouble area. I'm 5'3 and thought the length was perfect- beware though- this would NOT be good if you are in an outdoor, windy area. Just walking to and from the car gave others a peep show!","July 15, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM459","Lauren","Glamorous, memorable dress! So many compliments!","I originally ordered this dress in an 8 with a 6 as my backup size, but the 8 was so snug, I felt uncomfortable and that it was unflattering. Shout out to the RTR customer service team who helped me get a replacement size of this dress in a size 10, which was perfect! It fit like a glove, but in a way that I felt glamorous, sophisticated, and confident! I received SO many compliments on this dress. I have had my eye on this dress for around 3 years now and I'm SO glad I finally found the perfect occasion to rent it for. The back of the dress is the real show stopper, but I love that from the front, you can see a little mauve accent on the top of the straps to keep the dress interesting, and different from ""just another lbd"". I had read other reviews regarding the snaps on the bow coming loose, but I didn't have that problem at all. To be fair- I noticed that my size 10 dress had 4 snaps as opposed to 3 in the size 8, and the top corner of the bow was tacked to the strap, which helped add support. I'm not sure if that's a difference in design due to a larger dress size, or if I was lucky enough to receive a dress that had been slightly reinforced by a previous renter, but it worked beautifully for me! 10/10 would order again.","January 3, 2020","Party"

The 8 fit well, but the 6 definitely showed off my waist more so I wanted to wear that one. The bow came unsnapped a couple of times, but there are three snaps so it never came totally open before I had someone resnap it. Loveddd the dress and got so many compliments on it all night!","May 9, 2019","Wedding"

I ordered the 4 and the 2 as backup, and ended up wearing the 2. The bow DOES snap off. I should have heeded the warnings, but at least fiance was there to (begrudgingly) fix me each time. The bow is less of a blush and more of a taupe.","March 16, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM459","Elizabeth","Gorgeous dress!!","This dress was absolutely beautiful, and I loved wearing it. As other reviewers stated, the snaps will pop open so I used a prophylactic safety pin and was all set all night. I'll also note that the bow was not the color portrayed in the picture: not blush, I would call it more of a mauve, still beautiful. I didn't wear a bra for this one either, and felt the seams were well placed to not need pasties. Overall great experience!!","February 14, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM459","Kristina","Beautiful, but the snap bow makes it high maintenance.","I loved the design of this dress. It is classic in the front and very fun in the back. But as others have said before, the dress has it's issues. Personally, I was in between sizes (the 10 fit better in the bust and a little tight in the hips; the 12 was loose in the bust and fit better in the hips) and ended up just wearing the larger size since I would be eating and drinking throughout the night. I went braless although because the larger size was large in the bust, I probably should have gotten a sticky, backless bra to help fill out the dress. I read the reviews prior to renting the dress and took the advice of another user who said to safety pin the bow into place. There is no way to get into this dress by yourself--you can zip the bottom half on your own but you will need someone to snap the bow into place (and safety pin it into place, if you're smart). The snaps do not hold it in place! Any sudden movement will pop one of the snaps. Someone hugged me and they accidentally popped a snap! Overall, the dress is beautiful but high maintenance. I don't think I'd rent again.","December 12, 2018","Large"

I got lots of compliments, and it was great to dance in. My only complaint would be that the buttons on the bow would not stay together. I had to safety pin it to keep the back from flying open and having me flash everyone. Once it was pinned though, it was great.","October 28, 2018","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM459","Megan","Classy and Cute.","Overall, this dress was a success. The one downfall for me was if I bent over all the way to adjust my shoe or whatnot, the bow snaps in the back would bust open. The same thing happened if I was hugged aggressively.

I had to use a lot of pins to try to fix the bow in the back. And to be honest, the dress was nothing special when you look at it from the front.... but the back was really pretty, and I got a lot of compliments!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM459","Amanda","So many compliments!","Fit - true to size. A little snug on the hips, but if you have a smaller bust you may want to consider double sided tape under the arms. Pros - fit like a glove. I felt so pretty in this dress. I loved the low back and the bow made me feel so sassy. Easy to slip on. I did not wear a bra. Dresses that don’t require a bra are the BEST. Cons - the snaps in the bow do come undone pretty easily. I turned in my seat to watch the newlywed’s first dance, and two of the three snaps separated. Luckily I wasn’t at a table with total strangers. LOL. Helpful hints: double sided tape on the sides of the bust if you skip a bra. Tough for dancing because you do need to be careful - I almost flashed people on the dance floor because I lifted my arms up. Whoops! Also: The bow looks more pink in the pictures online than it really is. It’s more of a nude pink than a light pink.","October 9, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM459","RTR Customer","Worth the hassle","I say hassle because you cannot get the dress on yourself. Someone has to button the bow for you, and it unsnapped itself when I sneezed. It also unsnapped a couple more times from dancing. As long as you have someone on hand to snap you back up it's fine! Also, without a bra it leaves a gap on the side, I suggest getting a sticky, strapless, backless bra it worked great! Overall I loved the dress and received tons of compliments at the wedding!","October 7, 2018","Wedding"

The black sheath is pretty slimming, although I did wear spanx underneath because I'm only 3 months post partum. The only two downsides to the dress were that the bow unbuttoned easily - this might be because it's been rented a lot, and that there was excess fabric on the sides of the bust area. I'm not huge in that area so I was worried about side boob being exposed all night but it stayed put for the most part.

And was just as beautiful as the other reviews suggested. The only downside to the dress is that the bow snaps closed in the back, which is unreachable by the wearer. I wore the dress to a wedding, and about 20 different times throughout the night while dancing, or bending over to pick something up, some of the snaps popped open from the back. And no, it was not too tight, honestly it was slightly looser at the top than I normally would like. My husband was slightly annoyed because he had to snap it back together so often, but I thought the prettiness of the dress made up for that slight annoyance. Therefore, I would suggest wearing this dress to an event that is less active than a wedding!","August 14, 2018","True to Size"

I rented this specifically knowing the occasion would be outdoors and HOT-- and this dress was perfectly cool and did not show sweat stains. The fabric is thick without being too hot and the textured lace gives it great depth. I got many compliments throughout the night.

I didn't need a bra (B), which was good because you could see both a nude and navy bra through the lace. The see-through part, however, is not revealing, but if you do need a bra, consider pasties, a U-front, or just knowing that you'll see a bit of a regular bra.

There is a lot of cleavage to be seen in this with the cutouts down the breast bone so renter beware. I wore a low band black bra under it so it blended nicely (a nude bra still showed too much). Paired it with gold heels and hoop earrings. I wear between a size 4/6 and ended up wearing the 6 because I have a wide rib cage and with the waist cut outs, the 4 was uncomfortable.

The length was a tad more than I needed at 5'7"", but not bad with 3inch heels, probably perfect with 4inch heels (i've included 2 pics, one to show my heel-and that the dress is still slightly on the floor). The top was also a tad big, but nothing a great bra couldn't fix. Low back, so needed fashion tape to keep the back strap from showing if you don't have a low-back strapless.

It is silk lined and felt expensive. It hugged my curves but not too tightly and was very comfortable to dance in. I relied heavily on the reviews so I do have quite a bit of feedback: I am 5'9 and 155 lbs. I wear a 34 B bra. I ordered the 8L based on other reviews and it was way too long. Like 3 inches too long- I had 2-3inch heels and even with those I was stepping and tripping on the bottom. Luckily with the overlay I was able to pull the material up and pin it up underneath and you couldn't see the pins at all. That being said the boob area was also very roomy. With the open back I wasn't able to wear a bra but again that awesome overlay covered up the fact that I didn't fill the bust. Overall I really loved this dress and it made me feel sexy.

It runs big, the dress is kind of loose (even when you size down), and the sparkles add a little bit of bulk to it. So if you are going for a tight bodycon type of dress, this is not it. The arm holes were a little tight, and neckline I would have liked a little lower, both of these were bigger in the medium, but I was swimming in that size. So I went with the small. That being said, I did not get the rubbing issues that other people have mentioned under my arms. It sparkles a ton, and some of the sparkles have red and green in them (important information to have). I wore this to a NYE party and it was perfect.

I didn't like how it looked, the material was very thick (think scuba suit), I thought it looked cheap, and the 2 was a bit big even though I normally wear a 6. Once I added some accessories and shoes, I thought it was better but I got SO MANY compliments through the night! Not only that, but the dress was really comfortable. I chose to wear a strapless bra to avoid a strap slip in front of my boyfriend's law professors, but it would work with a normal bra. I ended up really liking the dress after I got over my initial impression. Would recommend I wore a 2 - I'm 5'4"", 135lbs., and am a 34DD. I usually wear a 6","March 24, 2019","Formal Affair"

I'm normally a 14-16 and the 10 fit like a glove! It does flare out so if you've got wide hips or a big booty it might make you look bigger (I have a small butt and hips and carry my weight in my belly so it worked for me) !

The fabric was thick and structured, great for a winter med school formal. Would highly recommend if you're willing to rent down one or two sizes!","January 17, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW78","Brianna","Runs large, great pop of color, not for my body shape.","Similar to the other comments, this dress runs large! I'm a size 12, pushing size 14 in my hips and thighs, so I got a size 10 and 8 in this dress. Although I chose to wear another dress, if I had gone with this I would have worn the size 8. For my body shape this dress wasn't very flattering. I felt that the bottom has too big of pleats which caused it to poof out more than necessary and therefore making my hips and thighs looks large. I did like the color and the top part fit great!!","January 9, 2019","Party"

I usually wear anywhere between a 12-14, depending on designer, as I have an apple shape and pretty good sized boobs. I am also 10 weeks pregnant in this picture, and was hoping for roomy dress that didn't make me look or feel like a beached whale. SO GLAD I sized down. Like, VERY GLAD. The 8 fit perfectly, anything larger would have been a tent on me. The fabric feels kind of like a wetsuit material, but it doesn't wrinkle and lays nicely for pictures. The deep V neck is perfectly sexy without showing too much or worrying about bras and boobs popping out. I wore a strapless bra, but probably could have gotten away with a demi regular bra. No pockets, which is a miss, but everything else is perfect! I paired it with a Kendra Scott necklace and loved the look!","January 5, 2019","Large"

Be warned that it runs pretty large. I'm usually a 4 in dresses and even the size 2 I wore was pretty big. I barely filled out the chest, and the fabric that tucks into the bra kept coming loose. I'd suggest sizing down 2 sizes if you can. Pros: The material is thick, warm, and high quality. The color is beautiful. Overall, great dress if you can get the size right.","December 30, 2018","Large"

The length was great (with flats) and the material is very nice--sturdy and rich feeling, not flimsy like so many ""teen"" styles can be.

It is both impeccably classy and seriously sexy at the same time. Currently 5'0"" and 140 in this photo, and even the 2 was a bit large on me. A 0 would have been perfect. If you want to hide a bit of tummy but still look feminine, the shape of this dress is your new bestie. Be forewarned that the color is siren red and the fit is about as flirty as a bride-to-be on a bachelorette in New Orleans--this might be a bit much for some weddings and conservative corporate events. Also--my bust is not as big as it looks in this photo; this dress will enhance a B-cup better than Victoria and her secrets. I'd imagine it would gap open on smaller busts though.

It definitely runs big so I'm glad I read the reviews before ordering. I am usually an 8 or 10. I order the 6 and the 4 ended up wearing the 4. The straps were a little loose towards the end of the night so I think I could have ended up in the 2 for a better fit on top. The only issue I had with this dress was the chest area. I couldn't wear my regular bra because it was showing. I ended up getting tape on cups and also fashion tape because the chest area was pretty big on me. Definitely would have looked much better if I had something to fill the top with! Overall this was a beautiful dress and I was very happy with it!

Granted, I wore flats to perform, but I don't know how high my heels would have had to be to get this to not drag on the floor (I am 5'4"").

So pretty from the front, but the back had a huge lump in the middle of my back. I'm almost 6 feet tall, but short waisted , and this seemed to cause the zipper to be too long, creating a giant bulge in the back of the bodice.

It made my shoulders and neck looked beautiful. Easy to put on by myself. Cons: the back of the dress attended to switch around a lot. I had to readjust every so often. This seam on the back of the dress rippled. I thought the dress had been repaired but when I tried on the alternate size it had the same with rain along the back seam which was noticeable because it was right against my butt.","December 4, 2018","True to Size"

Love different color and textures of the top and the bottom, and the rouching and the slit make it really special. There was some bunching in the back, but it didn't bother me too much. In formal dresses I typically wear a 6 or 8, but took a chance on the 4P since I'm short and need a petite length and it fit amazing. Was able to wear a strapless bra and didn't need any shapewear!

Additionally, I have a short torso, and am only 5'2'' and I thought that the dress was a little short, especially for dancing.

The fit is true to size, perhaps erring on the side of small. This was a true 0, no size inflation. The length was a wee bit short, and I'm 5'4"" so taller ladies, keep that in mind.

Only con was that it was a little big around the bust","This dress was great because it was able to hide imperfections and bring out some curves however it was quite loose around the bust which could relate to me only being a 32A and wearing a size 4. I definitely could've sized down to a 2 but instead I ordered a 6 as my backup. I saw previous reviews saying that it was tight around the arms but with the 4 it fit just right on my arms. Other than the bust area being loose, the rest of the dress fit well around my body without being too loose or too tight. I ate a full meal in the dress and it didn't show at all, maybe due to the thick fabric.

Even though it was a backup style, I loved it!","The white jumpsuit I had rented for my bachelorette party ended up being unavailable last minute. But Rent the Runway was so great, they sent me another jumpsuit they picked out and this Elizabeth and James dress that I requested as a backup option. This dress ended up being perfect, I liked it even more than the white jumpsuit I originally rented! It was comfortable, stylish and high quality. It's a short hemline, shorter than I normally wear, but doesn't look too revealing or inappropriate because it's a high neckline and the fabric is thick enough to where you can't see through it to see bra/underwear. It was wonderful for wine tasting during the day! Highly recommend.","July 10, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KGI4","Lauren","This dress looked horrible on me. I have never felt wider or fatter in my life. A huge let down.","This dress made me feel so fat and wide that I ended up in tears. Needless to say I did not wear the dress. I am usually a small, but I ordered a medium in this dress based on the reviews. What I realized after trying this dress on, was that it is really intended for super thin, very narrow people. The length was a bit short, which surprised me given that I am 5'1"" and this was not a petite size, but that was not the issue. The issue is how small this dress fit and that it really does not work on someone with any sort of curves. I am a 36B with normal width hips, a very slight pooch, a muscular build, and a wider rib cage. I know I do not have the tiniest waist, but nothing made that more obvious than this dress did. From the back, it showed off whatever back rolls I may have (you know the ones you get near your waist when you twist), and from the front, it emphasized my pooch and wider rib cage, and disguised any sort of waist I may have. It also made me look very top heavy/wide in the shoulders. I exercise a lot and have a decent amount of arm muscle, but the cut of the top of this dress made that look terrible too. I am bummed because I was so excited about this dress. I loved the color, the ruffled bottom, and the lace illusion, but I could not have been more let down once I tried it on. To recap, do not order this dress unless you are extremely narrow!!! It is not flattering otherwise.","July 21, 2017","Small"

The dress fit like a glove but not tight. Slit in the back helped with moving around but it's cozy around the legs for sure. Not super forgiving in the tummy region.

It's very simple but elegant. I paired it with nude colored heels and a cream colored shawl for the ceremony. Received a ton of complements! It was very form fitting so if you're a little curvy in the hips and thighs especially, like myself, may be best to size up. The fabric is thick so I didn't need to wear a bra but did need Spanx to help suck myself in and ""smooth"" everything out. If I had gone up a size, I don't think Spanx would have been needed if I had gone up a size from my normal 6.","October 10, 2018","Wedding"

It was also my first time meeting a bunch of my boyfriends family...so yeah. Perfect combination of classy but you could still see my butt.

You do have to pull it up a little to sit down or the neckline chokes you. I love the halter style it works really well for me. Both sizes fit me well and not too much of a difference.

I normally wear a size 4 and this size 4 was snug, but did not look or feel too tight. There were multiple layers of fabric below the lace dress to hide my mid section (which made me feel confident because I have a 5 month old and it hit my mid section and arms while still looking fitted). I also could wear a normal nude bra with it with thin straps and they did not show (so did not have to wear a strapless bra). I also ordered the size 2 , which was very tight ... I'm curious how the size 6 would have fit so in hindsight would have ordered the 4 and the 6. Received many compliments at a winter wine party. Fun wine burgundy color ... not normally a color I would have purchased, but fun for the night to break out of the little black dress routine. It was chilly that night, so I wore with black tights and booties...glad I had tights on when I sat down because it was pretty short. This dress would also look great in the Fall with nude booties!

It kept me warm despite temperatures in the low 30's - which might be a problem if you're going somewhere that you'll be dancing a lot. The only negative thing I can note is that the dress rides up pretty high when you sit down and there is no adjusting the dress to overcome this. I had to keep my completely opened dinner napkin over my lap to feel less exposed. I would definitely rent this dress again given the right event.","December 1, 2018","Party"

It perfectly fit the look I was going for and had beautiful lace details. I didn't find the fit and shape of this dress to be very flattering though.

I wore a normal bra of a similar color, and while the straps showed, I don't think people really noticed.

I definitely needed a 4R instead, but the 6 worked for the night. It was light enough to dance and not die, but long and just fine for a December night in the Northeast. Lots and lots of tape was used to keep me from having a potential wardrobe malfunction. I think if my chest was a size or 2 smaller, I wouldn't have had so many concerns.

I was also particularly nervous because it was my first time using RTR and I needed to fit my 7 mth preggo belly into a formal dress. This dress fit like a glove and hugged in all the right places but was stretchy enough to accommodate my baby belly. I would recommend using Hollywood tape where the dress cuts at an angled from the neckline to the armpit to tape down the dress so that there are no peep shows. ;)","November 29, 2017","Formal Affair"

The dress mostly fit everywhere (I ordered the 2R) but unfortunately the dress was way too long to wear (I am 5'4 3/4 and I tried on with 4-inch heels). Also, the bottom does not have a slit so I looked silly walking because I could barely move. I couldn't imagine dancing in it. I had great customer service where they sent me another dress over-night but was not able to wear this one.

I don't recommend this if you have large boobs of any kind, they fall out the sides and make you look wide. I'm petite and I knew this dress would be really long (I have super high heels for this exact thing), and it was STILL too long. I wouldn't get this unless you are a minimum of 5'6"", though the site suggests it would work for 5'2"" (not true). Also, it wasn't mentioned that there was a large slit up the back. I got the dress because I figured that even with super high heels, I might be able to flip it up in the inside and use fashion tape, but that wasn't an option. It really isn't made for a full figured woman. I have a bit of a butt too, and it was pulling in odd places.

It's not as large as it seems in the model, I'm petite (5'2"") and it was over my knee.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TB125","RTR Customer","Gorgeous dress!","Dress runs true to size, is a snug fit. It was ""to the knee"" on the model but was above knee on me. The rubberized band on the inside of the shoulders helped keep it in place but I did have to fuss with occasionally. I had to pull it down a few times so as not to expose leg of my spanx but this dress got lots of compliments, even with the minimal fussing I loved it. I had to go out and buy new spanx because although this dress is not thin, (great fabric) every stitch of undergarment shows. Literally, the stitching of my spanx was visible. I bought smooth ones and it was perfect. I am a full size 6 and it was a great fit. I got the 4 as a backup. I usually have a problem with dresses being to baggy in the waist but fitting fine in my bust and rear but, this dress was a perfect fit for my body. I would absolutely rent it again! I was asked by 4 people for the info on my dress. This dress is the perfect Little Black Dress!","February 1, 2016","True to Size"

First time was for a winter wedding party, the second for NYE. The dress is very form fitting, and a lot shorter than what appears on the model. I didn't have a big issue with the dress riding up or the shoulders slipping up. You can accessorize this dress however you like and it will look great. Be bold and go for some bright colored heels.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TB125","RTR Customer","Stylist Review","This sexy and sleek black sheath has a straight neckline, and it looks extremely sharp. The fabric is very stretchy and comfortable too, and there is no zipper, so you can easily slide in it, which are added bonuses. Pair with simple heels and jewelry for an overall understated elegant look. It runs true to size, and it is great for any cup size. However, it is fitted throughout the sleeves and midsection, so I suggest sizing up for backup. It is stretchy in the hips, so curvy women need not size up. I am 5'4, and the sheath ended at my mid-thigh to knee. Wear with a strapless bra. This chic sheath works great for Hourglass, Pear, Petite, Full Bust, and Straight & Narrow figures.","November 27, 2015","True to Size"

The back of the dress draws a lot of attention and compliments, but it does require you to wear ""sticky boobs"" because the fabric is relatively thin. If/when this dress is available to purchase I will be buying it instantly!","July 10, 2018","True to Size"

The 12 was a bit big, but fit better than the 10 as I didn't want any love handles showing. I thankfully didn't need to wear a bra, and I didn't feel I needed to adjust the dress every time I moved, so it was very comfortable and fuss free.

The back of the dress is why I rented it and it didn't disappoint. The part I didn't like was how the cut outs fell when sitting and/or posing for a picture. If I had thought about it earlier I would've put dress tape on the cut outs in the front of the dress. I'm a B cup on a good day and I could imagine the fit would be less comfortable/flattering for a larger chest.

It's so different than anything I've worn before, and definitely stood out. I wore this to a late April wedding in Charleston, and it was the perfect dress. It's super easy to dress up or down. I paired it with flat sandals and a chunky necklace, since the wedding was on the more casual side. I ended up renting this dress from the NYC Flagship store the morning of my flight because the dress I originally ordered looked awful on me.

CONS: Not bra- or shapewear-friendly. Material wrinkles very easily. I had to suck in my stomach the whole night -- the material clings to every trouble spot. Overall, the dress is light and lovely.

I think the name makes it sound ""cheap"" so I am glad I clicked through to check it out anyway. This is a high-low cut; perfect for petite women! The details make this dress; although it's very plain, the cut and flow of the train tell you this is a quality dress. I'd own this one (and as an Unlimited Member, there's really no reason for me to own any of these dresses! LOL). Can wear a regular bra, and there is some give in the fabric.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RSG2","RTR Customer","Gorgeous dress - more than just a basic conservative LBD, conservative lines with modern touches.","I got this dress as a replacement for one of the items in my original order, and I was SO impressed with it. The material feels very substantial and luxurious, but wearing it did not feel heavy at all. There wasn't a lot of give in the material, so I opted to size up (I'm usually between size 8/10) and I am glad I did - the dress was comfortable both seated, standing, dancing, and eating at the wedding that I attended. Also, even though it does have an invisible back zipper, I was able to get this dress on without assistance and without too much fussing and twisting/turning. There is some texture in the fabric of the dress, so it's not quite as plain as it might look online. The lines are conservative, but that makes it eminently suitable for anything from a professional event, to a wedding, or to a fancy dinner. Because of the color and simple lines, this was very easy to accessorize - you can go for a more classical look, or go bolder with color. I am so pleased with how this dress looked/felt, and I got so many compliments on it during the wedding. Once again Rent the Runway came through for me!","May 14, 2018","True to Size"

The dress runs true to size and the fabric has some stretch, however, it is fitted down until the hip area so I would consider sizing up for your back up if you are curvier.

This dress was far more expensive than the original I had chosen, which luckily also fit great in the size sent, I wore the original to the main event. I was able to wear this beauty to the cocktail party the night before the wedding we attended. I LOVED this style as soon as I saw it on line but couldn't justify a $300 rental for a basic black dress. Well let me tell you, after seeing, touching and wearing this style I can tell you it is well worth the price if you are considering it. The cut, fabric and design are stunning. The only draw back is that it was a little tight around my arms, which is weird because I am pretty petite. I am 5'2"", about 120lbs, and a 34B. I wore the 4R and it was great. I would certainly rent this again!","March 13, 2017","True to Size"

I was not wow'ed. It could have been more fitted and I really think the pictures RTR posted due it justice. There are side pleats (at the hip) that are very well constructed but made my hips look much larger than necessary (note- my waist is narrow but hips are wider).

This dress has an asymmetrical hem, which is darling. The loose, draping pieces on one side are fun and very unique. From some angles, it's impossibly chic. From other angles, it looks pretty weird. I tried to capture both dress experiences in the photos. If you're open to photographing extremely well from some angles and strangely from others, it's a very fun and fitted option. As others warn, it's quite tight. I'm a true 4, and this 4 was pretty snug. I think it needs to be tight to pull off the drapey pieces though, so that you have a contrast of tight curves and loose, flowing pieces.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL28","RTR Customer","Great color, great fit, not meant for high kicks","This is a fun dress ! I got the 8 with a 10 as a back up - I have no idea what I usually wear because I always go by waist and hip measurements (29"" / 39""), but the 8 fit great! The color is lovely and great for pictures. I will say - while it is comfortable once it's fully on and zipped, it is a little hard to wiggle into and has very little stretch. Keep this in mind if you are committed to wild or expansive dance moves, if you like to take stairs two steps at a time, or if you want to have a real easy time pulling this up and then back down in the restroom without the dress rolling your underwear clean off (I had to unzip to adjust). On the other hand, someone told me I reminded them of Jessica Rabbit in this dress, so I'm pretty sure it's all worth it.","March 18, 2020","True to Size"

I am almost 5'7 and it went down to my knees, which was exactly what I was wanting. The neckline is super flattering and a little sexy without showing too much cleavage. Wish I would have got a photo of the back, it was really pretty as well. This dress could be worn to so many functions, from a cocktail reception to a work event to date night.

I got compliments all night. I loved that I didn't have to wear a bra, could dance, the knee length makes it elegant, doesn't wrinkle. Would love to buy this dress.

I didn't wear a bra with it, just the petal cover stickies, and I felt fine/support (I wear a 34D).

I'm usually anywhere from a 4-6 and the 6 in this fit absolutely perfectly. Over a week later and I am still getting endless compliments on it! I felt so good in it and was able to sit, dance, etc very comfortably. The material is just the right thickness to kind of hold you in and not show spanx lines. I was even able to wear a regular strapless bra which I always love the option of instead of stickies but you could definitely wear those too. I'm not very busty at all (34B) but with my bra it did make me look like it mostly in photos so I would say if you ARE large chested just beware of that.

The length is perfect for a more formal or conservative affair, and the neckline can easily be pulled up or brought down depending on the amount of skin you want to show.

It was a little large in the bust, so I just put ""the girls"" in a bra with more padding. The train was plenty long enough and the front barely swept the floor which was perfect so I would not step on it. I chose to wear it with an up-do to showcase the ruffle on the shoulder, diamond chandelier earrings, and a bold red lip. I got so many compliments through out the evening.

It looks amazing, and you should rent it. I got the 6 and the 8, and in scrambling to get dressed to catch the shuttle to the ceremony, I put the 8 on thinking it was the 6. By the time I had realized what happened it was too late to change, but the 6 would have been better solely because the chest would have been tighter (I found myself having to pull up the strapless side of the 8 a few times throughout the evening). There's a short liner at the top that likes to pop out which is annoying, but likely not a problem with a tighter bust area. The dress was also longer on me than I expected it to be, but I prefer that length so I was perfectly happy with it. For reference I am 5'6"" and a 32G, and I did not wear a bra with this dress and felt supported, although you may want petals or pasties because it was fairly obvious when I was cold. The zipper is great, which I mention because I have previously rented dresses with impossibly difficult zippers.","August 27, 2019","Wedding"

This dress received many compliments so I got it again for a wedding last month. I will say that this dress fit very similarly to the black option, I got the same size and it was still very form-fitting and comfortable (I was concerned with the shoulder falling down, but it stays in place through a night of dancing). The only downfall to this dress vs. the black one is that this dress seems a little more of a cotton material than stretchy, Spanx type material which is how the black dress is. The red is definitely a little less forgiving than the black (which I thought sucked everything in nicely). However, I still received tons of compliments in this dress and would definitely recommend!","December 10, 2018","True to Size"

Hem of the dress touched the floor in flats, but still looked ok. The dance floor got very warm, and I sweated a ton, but it didn't show through the dress. One minor annoying thing was that the wind would grab the the ruffle at the top and flip it over, so I had to double check before pictures that everything was laying the right way.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ASR14","RTR Customer","Everybody loved the dress! Simple, sweet, and a little sexy for my bridal shower.","It fit very well, true to size. Fabric is nice but will show rolls, tight underwear lines, etc. The draping at the bottom is beautiful. A little hard to wear because I was worried my bra would show if the neck line moved (it would if I wasn't careful but luckily no peeks at the shower). It's a wrap dress, which I generally like, but I wish this one closed a little tighter. There's a small clasp/button on inside which is essentially worthless, it doesn't hold it well, so it's really just the tie that holds it together. But that ties at the waist so I was worried my slit would go too high if I sat the wrong way. I felt like I especially couldn't move much when I was opening gifts in front of everyone! Had to be very careful! Overall the dress is beautiful and fits well but I wouldn't recommend it if you want to party hard (I definitely wouldn't want to wear this dress drunk), dance a lot, or you have kids and will be moving a lot. If you do, at least do some double sided tape or something to fix the neck line issue.","February 23, 2019","True to Size"

I felt good in the M as well- so comfortable and pretty in person! I was told my many that I should buy it... which I might! I'm 5'7 and the length was okay with 3in heels...

Also, some of other reviewers said that the straps were too long - which is true if you don't tie them correctly.

Like other reviewers noted, the straps are long, so I adjusted them in the back to make sure the front was properly situated. I also used double sided tape along the side-boob area. I only did this because I have a small chest and wanted to make sure the dress held firmly in those areas. Those two adjustments were the only reasons this dress didn't get 5 stars. I'm 5'8"" and have a pear shape so I decided to get a 6 with a 4 as my backup. They both fit well, but I went with the 6, thinking it'd be more comfortable for sitting, eating, and dancing.

I will have to agree with the other reviews in that this dress is made for girls with bigger chests. Let's talk about the zipper on the dress for a second-it's awful and feels like I'm trying to rip a seam ever centimeter I move, even though the zipper itself wasn't even touch my skin. I'm a 4/6 dress and found that after zipping myself up I could grab a full pinch of fabric out from under my arm. I'm a 34 C and hardly ever have that problem.

The 16 fit well, although I needed some assistance with the zipper (this may have been due to it being used often vs the fit though). The very top boatneck was a little bit big for me but I added a chunky necklace with helped keep the neck in place. If I owned the dress I would have that altered but the shoulders are things tend to need alteration for me anyway. you can wear your own undergarments and I never had to worry about any wardrobe malfunctions. The pockets were big and deep and very cute! I take lots of photos and was able to carry around my flash power bank without it getting noticed. These pockets are not just for the look. The dress is well made and while the fabric is on the heavier side I was never hot even in the height of summer in Argentina. The variety of colors in the print make it easy to match to. It has more reds than I thought but it was lovely. I wore my nude sandals so as. It to compete and I carried a plum Cardi from my closet just in case the AC got too much for me.

It is a comfortable fit, true to size, beautiful fabric and color, pockets are a plus. It is a lot of fabric, but it is styled in a way that is still very flattering.

(Yes, she's done this before.) When I walked in, I told her: I've got to walk out with a dress with these parameters...x, y, z. Lord, I vetoed dresses without trying them on, and then THIS DRESS. I'm vertically-challenged, but surprisingly, these high-low dresses seem to work on me. Paired with heels, yes tiny girls, you can rock this dress. Now, can we just talk about that thing called pockets? Give. Me. Pockets. Any. Day., and I'm happy, especially if it doesn't make me look too hippy. I'm not a curvy girl, so my curvy girl queens, you may feel the skirt, which has a bit of a poof, may be too much. Before you veto, try it. The colour alone may change your mind about this because, let me tell you, the dress in a sea of black dresses, is not a stark red, but hues of red. SHOW STOPPER. Get ready for compliments. Go light on the jewellry. The dress really doesn't need a 5 pound item around your neck. Simple.

The ribcage was tight but the area right below the neckline kind of bubbled up in a weird way like there was extra material. There is no stretch to this dress at all so definitely size up from your regular size. It did fall beautifully and it seems to be constructed from high quality material.

That turned out to be right, although there was extra room in the chest (which surprised me since I'm breastfeeding). I received SO MANY compliments on the dress. It looked beautiful in person and is a high-quality material. The material has little to no ""give"" so size up if you think you may need it.

I was so excited to try on the dresses! I loved the fit of the first one but figured I could try the other style as well, since I had it. This style did not fit at all. I went online and they allowed me to pick 2 more dresses for no additional charge! Although these dresses did not fit at all I was so pleased with how quickly they came for me to try. I am a larger girl so I knew ordering dresses online would be hard. However, RTR made it such an easy process and I received this beautiful dress. My only negative of this dress was it was hard to find a bra to wear that did not show in the front with such a low V. I liked the look of the opening in the front but I wear a DDD so it is not possible for me to go braless. Overall it squeezed in nicely around my waist, wasn't too long, and the slit in the front was tasteful enough to show part of my leg but not too much.","April 17, 2019","Work"

I was worried about flashing someone with not wearing a bra and having a small chest in this dress - but it was no problem! Didn't feel too low at all and the halter tie made me feel secure. I would probably wear tape to keep it down next time though. I am 5'9"" and wore the 8L because it was all that was available - so I had to wear 1.5/2 inch heels. I would prefer not to wear heels so I would get the regular next time. I have broad and athletic shoulders so this dress worked great to show them off. LOVED the slit!

The back has a zipper, three buttons, and the straps tie up top so you’ll definitely need a friend to get you into this dress. The slit is perfect- sexy but not too high.

My tummy has never been the same after my children (twin bump), but the fabric gathers are fairly forgiving. I often can wear a 4 in a dress, but am almost always a size 6 in pants. I'm 5'-3"" and wore 2"" heels. The little train was fine most of the time, though had to pay attention on stairs. The back is a little form fitting over the bum, but the gathers do help.

This dress made me re-think that philosophy because I liked it so much. It may run a smidge big, and it's also stretchy. I forgot my spanx at home (thanks, drunk packing), and it didn't create a major issue. You could also tie the straps in the front to hide a belly situation if you're worried about it. The bottom of the dress is so fun, and the slit is a nice touch, but doesn't make sitting a challenge at all. I wish it had played to my chest a bit more - it kind of squashed rather than highlighted, so consider a strapless bra to keep the shape.","October 8, 2018","True to Size"

As others mentioned, the fabric is not flexible so I couldn't raise my arms much. It was TIGHT in the lower body and a bit restricting. I was scared to bend down and couldn't take huge steps but it was nothing unbearable.","September 17, 2018","True to Size"

I am 140lbs, 5'6"", and ordered the 6p, the length without heels was perfect. I did not wear a bra because the material shows everything. Speaking of the material showing everything, I advise that you wear some form of shapewear. I am in very good shape and don't normally wear shapewear but after looking at the pictures I definitely regretted that. the dress also wrinkles like none other, I was sitting in the car for 20 min and had wrinkles all over my lap.

I wore 3.5inch heels and the length was just right. If you're taller or want higher heels, order the long. I also wore a sticky backless bra which I highly recommend bc it looked much better than without a bra all together. A chunky, colorful necklace completed the look. I highly recommend renting this dress for any occasion.","June 28, 2018","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM360","Cassidy","Beautiful dress","This is an absolutely stunning dress! The color is more of a vibrant chartruese in person than how it looks on the website. The material felt very high quality, thick and slightly stretchy. I ordered both a 6P and 8P but decided to wear the 8P. For reference, I am 5'3"" and 138 pounds with a small 34B chest and big hips (usually wear a 28 or 8 in jeans). The 6 fit perfectly on my upper body but looked too tight in the hips, and the 8 was a little too big on the upper body but fit better on the hips. I wore it with an adhesive bra and spanx. After reading reviews, i ordered the petite sizes so they wouldn't be too long because i didn't want to wear 5"" heels at an outside wedding. I got 3"" heels, and i felt like the dress was about an 1"" shorter in the front than prefer so the regular length might have been ok for me, but petite was not bad either. I loved this dress on, but i think it is a little better suited for someone with less hips than I so that it doesnt cling as much. Everytime i walked, it would start to shift and twist so i had to keep adjusting it which was very annoying. Overall, i loved this dress, but I wouldn't rent it again because I don't think the sizing was perfect for me. The size 6 dress i was sent was also stained with spots in a couple places, but it didn't end up mattering since i wore the other size.","March 11, 2018","Wedding"

In the back, about 1"" of the dress hit the floor, but it made for a really pretty train and I didn't trip over it once. This dress is SO comfy, and it's WAY more stunning in real life.

The pictures make it look yellow, but it has a bit more green to it in person. I loved the dress, but wished the fit was just barely more in my shape. It was slightly too tight in the butt, and slightly too loose in the chest. I did end up pulling on it quite a bit because the inside layer of the dress kept riding up.

I felt like a lime green goddess and I would definitely wear it again for another occasion. Like another wearer said, a black strapless bra is fine to wear with it and didn't show. I pressed it before the wedding since it had some wrinkles from transit, I recommend ironing from the inside as I did, if needed.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RED13","Gretchen","Completely obsessed with everything about this dress!","I absolutely fell in love with this dress the moment I saw it on Rent the Runway! I was initially very nervous as to how it was going to fit, or if it would fit at all. Being very petite, I was worried that the 38 was going to be too big, but when I received the dress & tried it on the 38 fit like a glove! It couldn't have been more perfect. It was a bit snug in the chest, but I was still comfortable, however if my bust were any larger it might have been a bit of an issue. The length was definitely longer on me than the model, as expected as I am only five feet tall, but it still hit at least an inch above my knee & was still very flattering. I wore this to my college senior formal and felt so beautiful! I got so many compliments on it, and I was so sad to have to give it back. I would one hundred percent recommend this dress, you won't be disappointed! Not only that but I was beyond impressed with Rent the Runway! The dress arrived on time in great condition & they made the whole process very easy. I will definitely do this again!","April 16, 2015","True to Size"

Those reviews were correct for me. Tight in waist and huge on top. Just hung way to low. 34b/c chest. I tried tape and that did not work. I was too uncomfortable and had to change before dinner. It doesn't look super bad in a photo I guess and I actually got several compliments on the dress by strangers probably because it is pretty and a standout color but the straps I needed to try to pull towards my neck so it would tighten the chest a little but still didn't help much at all. I also felt the belly area was super unflattering. Definitely did not hide that I was on vacation and eating everything in sight. I have only had a handful of dresses that I wouldn't rent again and this is one of them unfortunately but clearly it works out for some people!

I think you would want to use fashion tape regardless, it is pretty low cut. The slip underneath is very short, however I am 5'8-9 and am larger on my bottom half.

It was a HUGE hit. That being said, the bust is definitely gaping. I'm small-busted, so a low neck doesn't usually bother me or look too exposed, but in this case, anytime I moved the straps would gape. It wasn't really workable. I fixed it by using a pin at the bust, which worked fine. I'd definitely rent again for a showstopper dress, but it definitely needs some alterations to be workable.","July 31, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR40","Shannon","Brightly colored dress that fit in great at an Indian wedding","This dress is gorgeous and so fun! I wore this to an Indian wedding and even though I wasn't in a sari like some of the other female guests, this brightly colored number fit right in. I ordered a small and backup size medium: while the small actually fit perfectly in width and chest area, it would have been WAY too short (I am 5'10"" but also have a long torso). Given that, I wore the medium but as others have described, it was big on top so I had to do some checking to make sure it stayed in place. Regardless, it would be a short dress without the additional bottom layer, but this part of the design made it wedding appropriate. All things considered, although I loved wearing it, I am glad it was a rental and not something I own in my closet. In summary, the pros: it is light and airy for a summertime wedding, beautiful color, unique style, lots of compliments. Cons: (as others have hinted) the top runs large so I had to be careful of any accidental nip slips, and for a taller girl especially it can also be revealing on the other end.","June 3, 2019","True to Size"

If your small chested, go a size smaller because the top is very roomy or get some fashion tape! Regardless of the spacious top, I've never received so many compliments on a dress before. So many women came up to me and asked where it was from. It's light, airy, and just an overall beautifully colored and textured dress.","May 21, 2019","Other"

I couldn't have sized down to a medium because the waist would have been too tight but it definitely was made for a bigger bust (tricky because much bigger chest would probably be popping out) I used to a low back strapless bra and fashion tape to secure and I still felt nervous and used my hair to ""cover"" up a little.","September 3, 2018","Wedding"

Neither stayed on very well so I had to re-pin and re-tape a few times throughout the night.

I didn't wear a bra but some might feel more comfortable with pasties since it can move a bit out of place if you're turning/moving around a lot!

I love the length of this dress and it definitely is a dress you can work to a work event or even a formal affair!

(I tried to lighten the picture so y’all could see the fit over the bump, but my husband’s suit is kind of dark, so apologies if you can’t tell!) I normally wear an 8 so I got a large, which fit really well. Only complaint is that it was a little warm, so by the end of the night (after hours of dancing) I was HOT.

Panties and bra were not an option as panties would roll down after hiking the dress to use the restroom. I normally wear a 4 and also wore the 4 in this but ordered the 6 for backup like others had suggested, to size up. It’s very tight when sitting. The dress flatters as it hits nicely at the knees. It was an absolute hit. The feminine ruffles and the sexy one shoulder made the dress classy but modest. A too large step ripped the slit, therefore I needed to be extra careful dancing and moving.

This was the perfect dress for an autumn/winter event. I wore it for my office holiday party and it was the perfect replacement to the typical red dress. The dress runs SMALL. If you have big hips or a big butt definitely size up because although the material is thick, it doesn't have much stretch. My measurements are 36AA-32-44. The dress fit great up top but TIGHT on my hip and butt. I was doing the penguin walk and dancing was not an option. It took my husband 15 minutes to zip because the zipper kept jamming on the threading/fabric. The slit on the back of the bottom, the fabric unraveled. I had to enter the car standing and I stood all night long because the dress was that tight in my lower half. I gave it 4 because it was beautiful BUT it definitely runs small.

The dress is very form fitting, and I was able to wear it without a bra. The only thing I didn't love is the stretchy under part of the dress seemed to get a little bunchy in my mid section, and I had to keep pulling it down. Might be because I am so short. Length was perfect on me.","January 15, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW86","Kelsey","So Many Compliments!","This dress is an amazing deep blue and the low-cut back was just the little bit of sexy I was aiming for. It was worn for our annual work Christmas party, so I needed it to cover areas without being too revealing. It was snug, but not in a bad way. My behind is large, which I found a little frustrating because the dress wanted to keep creeping up my backside. I wore black tights so there wasn't so much skin being shown. Sleeves were a tad long, but overall I enjoyed the fit. It was not itchy. I was determined to wear a bra with this... but it was NOT happening. Instead I grabbed some athletic tape and fixed myself up. Worked like a charm. Received SO many compliments throughout the evening. No one was wearing anything even close to this. I've recruited several women from work to check out RTR!","January 10, 2019","True to Size"

I wore the Medium, with some help from some Spanx and some creative bra solutions. Probably could have worn the Large, but the sleeves were really long and bunched up. There's a very deep V in the back, so a normal bra is not an option. Had to use some stick ons to give me some shape, since I don't have a naturally big chest. If you're booby, you could probably wear this without a bra and be fine. It's lined well, and none of the sequins bothered me at all. Wore it all night and got tons of compliments. Super fun dress.","January 2, 2019","True to Size"

I think it would work just as well for a straighter body type as a very curvy body type. I was so comfortable all night. I did have to wear a sticky bra for support as the dress didn't offer much, but for smaller, younger, or augmented breasts I think you could easily go without. I'm a size 4/27, but the medium was ok, so I decided to try on my small and was so glad I did. It hugged every curve perfectly. I can't wait to rent again!","January 2, 2019","True to Size"

I usually wear a small (2/4) but was almsot 32 weeks pregnant when I wore this dress so I got a medium, so I'd say pre-pregnancy the Small would've fit perfect. This dress has a TON of stretch (hence being able to fit my bump). The material is thicker so definitely not for a hot/summer outside event, but fit perfectly for my husband's Christmas party. The low back is very sexy, I did have to wear a backless/sticky bra because a regular bra would've definitely stuck out. The sequins and overall quality of the dress were great. I got SO many compliments for this dress. The color looks slightly different indoors (more green than teal) than outdoors but is beautiful in all lighting!

There's a TON of material towards the bottom of this dress which gives it the beautiful mermaid shape, but makes it slightly challenging to gather and hold up. I didn't mind at all. Gave me a chance to show off my shoes a little here and there. The mesh is very fine and sheer but also sturdy and nicely made. There is a ton of stretch in this dress so I was completely comfortable and never had to pull or twist or adjust anything throughout the entire evening. I had a tiny bit of extra room through the waist and hips of this dress, but I still feel like it fit true to size because I am thin and narrow.

It's definitely a great dress but I wouldn't say it's a show stopper. I'm a little surprised people said it runs so large. I fluctuate between an 8, 10, or 12 pending the make of the dress and I would say the 10 was very true to size, definitely couldn't have gone with the 8. It was a little shorter than I'd like and the lining kept running up, but the color is really really nice, the material thick (good for winter), and the detailing is definitely unique. Unfortunately the liner seam at the color was ripped upon arrival with some thread showing. I was able to make it work with some fashion tape so no harm no foul, but if I hadn't of had that you would have seen the thread/rip at the collar of the dress. I also don't love the slightly puffed shoulder, but that's my personal preference. Dress was good for this event but I wouldn't rent again.","January 8, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS15","Lindsay","So small!","I should've trusted the reviews and the sizes they ordered. After trying 4 strapless dresses which were all too big I went for this in size 2. I usually wear 0 and I worried that the size 4 which other people wore would be too big on me. The 2 was so tiny I wasn't even able to zip it up! Fabric and color is lovely and I would order again but in size 4. I didn't like that the eyelet material is not attached to the inner lining of the skirt so the pockets didn't line up with the layers.","November 18, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS15","Amy","Worse RTR experience ever","The dress doesn't indicate the size on it so I went off the size on the hanging. There appears to be very little difference between the 10 and the 12. Honestly could have probably used an 8. The top is so large and I'm not a small bust woman. I went without a bra as any strapless bra could be seen from the top. I taped the dress directly to my boobs to prevent a nip slip. There is no clasp at the top of the zipper and it doesn't say in place so I kept pulling it up all night. SIZING SUCKS","September 30, 2019","Wedding"

My only complaint was I had difficulty zipping it up. I must have an abnormally large rib cage, because it was impossible to zip from the back. I had to zip in the front and scoot the dress around. The waist and bust fit well, it was just the bodice that caused problems. Overall great dress, but would order a size up next time.","August 12, 2019","Small"

I wore this to an office Christmas party with matte gold peep toe heels, the look was great for the occasion. The material is gorgeous, amazing color and thick. This fit was not ideal. I am 5'5"" and 120lbs- normally rent 0 or 2, for this dress I went a size up and squeezed into the 4. Like others have said the zipper doesn't ""lock"" at the top so a little nervous for it to scooch down throughout the night. The corset fit is quite snug around the rib cage yet the bust was a bit large for me (I'm a 32 b) but I made it work. I loved the look of the dress and received many compliments on it but it was not my favorite dress that I've rented.","January 6, 2019","Party"

It is very high quality material. I got a TON of compliments at the wedding I wore it to. It is a little loose at the top on the sides, which helps avoid any ""armpit rolls"" strapless dresses sometimes cause. However, the heavy material and the looser sides left me pulling up the dress a lot throughout the night (but well worth it as I felt like a million dollars!). The zipper also doesn't have a hook & eye at the top and falls down...this was easily remedies with a safety pin. I would highly recommend this dress! I think it would be flattering on any body type.","September 10, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS15","Brittany","Loved it","I am usually a 2 in dresses, but I definitely needed the 4 in this one. I didn't have to wear a bra with it because it runs quite small in the bust. Lots of cleavage. Since there is no clasp at the top of the back zipper, it ""fell down"" while I was dancing, and I nearly popped out of it. So beware of that issue if you are a size D. I loved the color and the lace was such a unique pattern. I would rent it again, but probably not for an event that involved dancing because of the clasp issue.","August 29, 2018","Small"

One thing to note: I normally wear size 10 or 12, and in the 10 the chest area was way too big for me (36B). I tried wearing a padded push-up bra underneath and using double-stick tape to prevent the dress from slipping on off of me when I was on the dance floor. In addition, the bodice and waist of the size 10 was a bit tight and uncomfortable when sitting down. The silk lining/layer underneath was a bit short, and I felt it wasn't covering my bottom when I sat down. Otherwise, it was a fun and flattering dress.","May 29, 2018","Large"

I needed to wear a padded bra to fill in the top nicely, and even so it is very low cut! Boning in the top worked well. Underskirt is pencil-shaped so was very snug on my hips but you couldn't tell it was bunching up bc of the overskirt. Material is lovely and looks very expensive.

I received a ton of compliments on the dress, it was classy and elegant, and not at all boring! I was able to wear a strapless bra with it, although someone younger than me might not need a bra :) It was well lined in the bodice. Fit true to size. I'm usually a size 4 and the 4R was just right.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH147","Anel","Absolutely stunning dress...tons of compliments!","I rented this dress for my law school's Barrister's Ball. I originally ordered the 10R and 12R. I usually wear 10 but reviews said the dress ran small, especially for those with wide hips, thus I sized up. The 10R was very tight around the hip area and very uncomfortable to sit down in. The 12 fit perfectly BUT it was short and I did not like how it came to my ankles and showed my shoes. I am 5'3 and would never have thought to order a long but after seeing how short the dress was I called RTR and was overnighted the 12L. The length was perfect but the top seemed to be stretched out a little. It was very loose and looked awkward. I didn't have any double-sided tape and chose to just tuck the top in. You couldn't tell the dress was not supposed to look like that. Overall, I was in love with this dress the moment I saw it and so happy I was able to wear it to my last ball. I received compliments all night and I felt gorgeous and elegant in it. RTR sent the Ella Carter Aubrey earrings as my mystery bling and they paired with the dress perfectly.","April 23, 2017","Small"

My favorite part of the dress outside the fit was the train in the back, talk about having some glam moments with it. I did rent the regular size as I wore almost 4"" heels which made the dress the perfect length for me.","April 4, 2017","Formal Affair"

However, the medium was too small on me (am normally a size 8), so I had to wear the large, but the straps wear too long.

I will say I don't have much in the breast department so I could see this being a bit too low cut for bigger breasted gals.

I did not wear a bra with it because of the low back, but I wish I had worn something to pull my boobs up a little bit.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ML92","RTR Customer","This dress was perfect for my Mardi Gras party in NOLA! It was the right amount of sparkle and fun!!","The dress was a tight fit but very comfortable to wear all evening. The back of the dress is very low so a normal bra would't work...I purchased a backless bra from Victoria Secret that worked perfectly. The dress does sip up in the back but instead of a clasp, it's a button and it does come undone easily so be aware.","March 7, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ML92","RTR Customer","Sparkly, classy and fun!","I found this to be a great choice for my first rental! It was for a bachelorette party and was a stunner... comfortable, classy and super fun! In the pics of me trying it on, you can see how the color can change depending on how you shift the sequins- very cool! I didn't find it to be as short as everyone else was saying. (I'm 5 foot 4 and thought it was just perfect.) I ordered the 8 and 10 because the 6 was out and ended up wearing the 8. Though I would've been interested to see the 6, I think the 8 worked out fine. Overall, it's a great dress to rent because of how it's flexible about sizing. (It's not a bodycon type dress and is meant to be slightly loose through the middle which allows some give.) I also used an adhesive bra from target and would recommend that with it too! Happy dress hunting!","January 29, 2017","True to Size"

Normally I'm a size 2 but since this dress is stretchy and I'm pretty flat chested I opted for the 0 so it wouldn't be too loose in the front or shoulders. It fit great up top and was thick enough in front where I didn't have to worry about a bra with the low back. It is a bit short so I constantly had to make sure to keep it pulled down as much as I could over my bigger bum, but I managed and had a great time in it! If you like black and gold shine, this is a great party dress!","January 15, 2017","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ML92","Amy","Perfect sequins dress","Sometimes I feel like sequins add weight to your frame since they are shiny and often layered on thick. Not the case with this one! They are black and gold and worked well on my athletic frame. The sequins are also kinda soft to the touch which is nice so they don't bug you while your dancing￼! Looks cute in photos too, wish I had a better pic!","January 4, 2017","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ML92","Brittany","Perfect NYE Dress","This dress was great. As can be expected the sequins occasionally caught on something (usually my tights or my lace glove), but it wasn't too frequent. I highly recommend using double sided tape to keep the back/shoulders in place- I added some to my order last minute and would NOT have been able to wear this dress without it. Looks as expected, fit true to size, wasn't too long on me- I'm 4'11'' so I always worry about length.","January 2, 2017","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ML92","Lindsey","LOVE THIS DRESS!","This dress fit perfectly and was a huge hit at the holiday party. It is so comfortable and forgiving, and so beautiful! I used the tape on cup bra which was perfect since the back goes low. The zipper goes the entire length of the dress and can go up from the bottom- keep an eye on that. I had it open from the bottom once but luckily we hadn't yet left the house, and it didn't happen again after that. Wish I could buy this dress and wear it to every party this season, felt like a million bucks.","December 6, 2016","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ML92","Price","Great dress, but get the right bra!","The dress fit was perfect for an '80s theme formal gala I was attending for work. But the back was much lower than I thought. I tried a low back bra extender with my regular bra, but it didn't go low enough and the dress was so open that the straps still showed on the side. As a 34DD, I ended up using a sticky, backless bra with a little extra fashion tape. Also, beware that the zipper in the back goes both ways. One at the bottom and one at the top. Make sure to keep an eye on it, so the bottom zipper doesn't ride up. When sitting down the shoulders did tend to fall as the dress lifted, so another reason I was happy with the backless bra instead. Overall, a SUPER fun dress for a fun night out!","October 31, 2016","True to Size"

I needed a little more material for when I put my leg up at the reception to rest and this fit was great. Definitely runs large, I could've sized down one size.

I have worn this dress three times over the last two years because it fits wonderfully and is super comfortable. Personally, I prefer a shift dress to most other cuts because I am pear shaped. I've got hips and a belly that I don't want to accentuate with a tight fit. A shift dress, specifically this one, flares out so you don't feel self Conscious. The material is solid but not heavy. It comes right to the knee, which I like. I've worn this dress to two weddings and a bridal shower and would wear it again if I could find an event where I'm not around the exact same group of people.","July 10, 2018","Wedding"

I opted for the size 10 which gave me more space up top and still has a nice shape in the waist for me even though it was on the looser side. I got SO many compliments about the dress it was unreal. Perfect for a bridal shower you don't want to wear solid white to. It went with the theme perfectly and added a little extra touch. Highly recommend! It wasn't too short. Not too showy.

The sequins at the arms didn't bother me like some other reviewers. However, others are right about how tight the band is at the bottom - it's the only part of the dress with no stretch. I was ok going down stairs but had challenges going up because of it! I'm between a 0 and 2 and wore the 0. Would rent again!","December 21, 2019","Party"

Nice things about the dress - thick material and the beading is sewed on well. Other than that, this dress was weird. It is not a true sheath dress, it almost wants to be fitted but made me look like a sack of potatoes because it is not really fitted either. The hem of the dress is tight.

I loved that it swayed between bronze and gold in the photos, which made it seem easy and versatile to style, and that it was short but not revealing. I ordered this as my backup to my original dress and when the original didn't work, I was still excited to wear this. I will say that it does fit true to size, but if you are pear shaped like me, the waist and bust will be quite roomy. I found the hips to be a little tight, but there is some stretch to the material (and having shapewear on is helpful, too). The sequins did not scratch, and I had no trouble moving in it all night long. It was a little short, but paired with black tights, it wasn't an issue at all. I loved that it had a different look in just about all the photos, but it was still beautiful from all points of view.

I'm 5""2' and typically 110 lbs so I would have worn a 0 or 2. But at 21 weeks pregnant with twins (so belly basically measuring 25 weeks!) I was convinced I'd need a 6 or higher. Well that wasn't available...so I ended up getting a 4 and a 2 as backup. The 2 ended up fitting best!! Both fit my belly...this dress is very stretchy...and the sleeves fit better with the 2. There is that band around the bottom that makes maneuvering around somewhat difficult. But regular walking, sitting, standing, was not a problem.

It was actually a backup sent after a shipping error but I ended up loving it more than what I ordered. I was 26 weeks pregnant for the event and really don't like any maternity specific clothing. This fit wonderfully around the bump and was comfortable too. I will mention, there is a very tight band around the bottom of the dress that made it incredibly hard to walk or sit (basically move at all). This band is not elastic and has zero give. I didn't feel like the dress was too small but the band might have been better if I wore a bigger size.","October 25, 2016","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HB2","Holly","Great material - glittering mermaid armor","The material is fabulous and looks amazing - lots of tiny sequins in a great pattern and I got a ton of compliments. The cut is a little odd though - I frequently wear 6 or 8, but even the 6 was very big and loose especially around the waist and hips, while the hem was oddly restrictive. The tightness of the hem may be what made the bagginess around the waist and hips more noticeable. I didn't expect anything completely form fitting based on the style and material, but based on the pictures, I thought the waist would be at least slightly defined. Instead, it was very loose (comfortable at least) around the waist and hips while being noticeably restrictive around the hem when trying to take big steps or (as I think someone else mentioned) when going to the restroom where it was almost easier to take the dress off rather than pull it up. While I think a 4 might have been a better fit everywhere else (especially in the waist), I don't know if I could have been comfortable with a tighter hem as the 6 was already a little annoying. Still - gorgeous material, sequins, pattern - I got a ton of compliments. I wore it with a light black jacket when it was cold, gold heels, gold bracelet and earrings.

It was snug and not the original look I was going for, but it wound up still looking really nice. The bottom rim of the dress is super tight but wasn't really a problem until I had to get in the car and drive...but dancing was fine all night.

I am 5'1"" and, while it wasn't the worst standing up, it was very dicey to sit down in. 2) The sequins were very scratchy around my thighs. I will say, however, that it basically runs true-to-size. I had my usual fit problems -- the 4 was too tall in the shoulders, the 2 was too small in the chest -- but, c'est la vie, that's just my body type. The girls were definitely squashed in the 2, but we made it work okay. You'd be fine if you have, you know, more appropriate proportions. Okay, three things. 3) I felt RADIANT in the gold. My husband and I attended the black tie birthday party of a WWII hero, so everyone was about 30 years older than we were, and I was pretty much the only woman there not in black. We came in late, everyone turned to look at us, and the speaker complimented me from the podium. Youth -- and sequins! -- for the win. Oh yeah! And 4) This was my first RTR and I'm completely sold.

The fit was great for my athletic body shape. If you have nice arms and curves, this will show them off! Highly recommend.","November 10, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM427","Catherine","So gorgeous!","I ordered the 0p and 2r because those were the last two sizes available! The 2r slightly gapped away and sagged around the armpits, but in the front where the cut outs are, so I ended up going with the slightly more snug 0p. Really loved the length of the 0p too, I'm 5'5"" and wore 3.5"" heels and thought the length was perfect. NOTE there is a tiny train with this dress! Overall this dress was stunning, elegant, and didn't require more than a bold pair of earrings to tie it together.","October 17, 2019","Wedding"

It runs a little big and long so I ordered a 4p (usually a 6) and it fit so well I didn't have to wear spanx or a bra. It kept its shape all night and was super flattering in the back.","July 31, 2019","Wedding"

As a short woman it's hard to find petite dresses that fit well. It was still a tad bit long on my 5 foot 1 frame but with 3 inch heels it didn't drag. The color photos darker than it is in person. I would recommend this dress again and again 10/10!","April 16, 2019","Formal Affair"

It's a beautiful navy. I have a more athletic cut and the way the arms/shoulder are cut are super flattering. Didn't wear a bra, but if you wanted, sticky boobs are probs best. Spang recommended since the material will show fine lines from tummy pudge or undies. Can't recommend this dress highly enough.","November 14, 2018","Formal Affair"

It was a little long (I am 5'2''), but with heels the front just barely touched the floor. I didn't realized when I ordered it, but it is longer in the back than in the front, so make sure that you are comfortable having it drag behind you.","November 24, 2017","True to Size"

I ordered the 0R, as I know how this designed fits me, and it was waaaaaay too long! I think it might have been a mis-marked 0L. Anyway, I called RTR and they overnighted me a 0P, which was STILL too long, even in 3"" heels! It was big overall, but at least I could eat the fancy dinner without worrying about holding in my stomach... :)","October 31, 2017","Large"

This was a backup I received as my original backup wasn't available. The stylist chose it and was ON POINT! I was a little worried about the size as it runs a tad small but it worked great with some Spanx underneath. The length was perfect with heels or would work with flats for a short train. The ruffles on the back are a fun detail. I was complimented all night and am still getting asked about the dress a week later!","October 31, 2017","Formal Affair"

I absolutely loved the neckline and back. I am short (5'4"") and absolutely do not need a Long cut, but it worked for the purpose of 4 inch heels.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM427","Maria","Black Tie Invited Gala event","The dress fit so well and was really comfortable the whole night. The open back was beautiful and I loved how the top of the dress fit because I have larger shoulders and this didn't constrict my shoulders / chest in any way. The train was easily manageable, and I wore short heels and liked how the dress hung at the bottom. I would say it ran a little large, I wore the smaller size and it was still a little loose in the hips, but didn't look bad. Love this dress, would definitely order again!","October 2, 2017","Large"

The trumpeted skirt was very simple and elegant. The back was high enough where a normal strapless bra could hide underneath it.

Im a 34d and didnt have to wesr a bra; the fabric held them well. Im a larger 0 and would say this was on the bigger side of the size.

The only con - since I have such a large chest, it was very hard to find a bra that would hold me up but not show. I had to invent something by using a clip in the front to clip the two straps together. I also had to adjust it all night. But how hot it looked, it was worth it! I also have an unfortunate belly area but barely had to wear shapewear. The dress just fit my body really nice. Highly recommended.","June 6, 2017","True to Size"

I am 5'3"" and this dress was floor length with me wearing 4 inch heels (4 petite was not available for rent). The bust area was a little big for me even though I am a 32DD, but I just used some fashion tape to keep it down. I wore sticky bra cups under this dress and it was perfect.

The material was rich and hung well over my curves. It accentuated all the right places and was feminine. I got so many wonderful compliments. My only wish is that the ruffles on the back hadn't been a little crushed looking. I don't think most people could notice, but I did. I normally wear a size 4 and this was true to size.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DJ55","Anita","Young and sweet","I am neither young or sweet, but this dress made me at least feel like it. It reminded me of the types of dresses I wore as a child, with the oversized collar. The fabric is a lightweight cotton, but with the lining felt warmer than I expected on a 100 degree day. Absolutely go for the nude undergarments because everything shows. The fit was off slightly. The arm holes are oddly narrow and tight, the top is a bit snug if you have a larger bust, and the length is a few inches too long. I'm 5'7"" and it looked fine for me, but might seem too much for someone shorter. I'm also between a 10 and 12, and the 12 just perfectly fit my top section. There was no room to spare, and zero stretch, so don't expect to squeeze into this one.","July 17, 2018","Vacation"

As a busty woman I am extremely uncomfortable in any dress that requires strapless or heaven forbid no bra. This dress allowed me to wear a regular bra completely concealed so I felt supported through the whole evening. This dress runs true to size, if not a little larger, but it remained form-fitting. As a petite woman I was still pleasantly pleased with the cut as it fell just below my knees. I was able to wear this dress with NO Spanx and still feel stunning. The dress is so flattering and I received so many compliments. (Will update with a full length picture when I have it).","May 22, 2019","True to Size"

I had to keep pulling the dress down to get those bulges out. I fit into the size 8 but it was a little Moreno right on my postpartum belly than I was comfortable with so I went with the 10. It was an overall ok dress. I did get lots of compliments on it.","March 27, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LRL12","Carrie","Beautiful yet simple dress","Very pretty, comfortable, and forgiving dress. It’s fully lined and lightweight, with a bit of stretch so very wearable. I wore with a regular bra and underwear, no spanx or special undergarments needed. My only complaint is that the dress was slightly big on me through the waist and hips, and the ruching (which I had not noticed when I ordered) therefore sagged at the belly, which I thought was a bit unflattering. I should have gone down for the back up size instead of up, but I’m only a few months postpartum and was unsure of current sizing. Also, I think the dress might have been tight in the chest and shoulders in a smaller size. Overall this is a very pretty dress and perfect for occasions that require more coverage/modesty.","March 26, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LRL12","Chelsea","A beautiful intimate occasion.","First time using RTR, won’t be the last! 1) The dress came a day before the expected date, which was awesome. I loved the packaging. Great for traveling as well. 2) I ordered a size 16, & my back up was a 14. The 16 didn’t fit bad, but it didn’t fit as nicely as the 14 did. So, I will say this dress is true to size. I’m usually a 14/1X, but since this was a Ralph Lauren dress, I assumed it would run narrow, which it didn’t. It definitely has some give to it, so you could probably size down, if you want it to hug you a bit. The color and lace was just gorgeous for the recent end of winter and transition into spring. It’s definitely a wine-burgundy, vs. RED color. I wore this to a semi-formal wedding at Maggiano’s, and I felt like it was the perfect outfit for it. Not too flashy but not plain Jane. I would actually love to buy this dress, it serves so many purposes.","March 24, 2019","True to Size"

This was my first rent the runway experience and it was great! Wore this beauty to a work gala in winter and it was perfect for the occasion: classy, stylish and really comfortable. I prefer to dress modestly, particularly for work, and this dress was just right. It was form fitting but not tight, and I loved the knee length and conservative neckline. I especially loved that this dress had long sleeves that fell right above my wrists, great for the time of year for my event. It had a flattering gathering across the midsection and was a beautiful deep wine color. I had ordered the 4 and the 6; the 6 was a bit roomier but the 4 was a bit shorter so I wore the size 4 which was a better fit for length. I would totally re-rent this and would recommend it to anyone considering it! Great dress!","February 7, 2019","True to Size"

Both the size 2 and 4 fit but I opted to wear the 2 (the back-up size) as I felt more comfortable in it. When I first tried it on the style seemed to accentuate my midsection in an unflattering way but incorporating some light control undergarments did the trick! The length was just at my knees which was perfect for the weather! The color is gorgeous and it was perfect dress for the winter months and the event!

At 5'1"", the dress hit below my knees. My only complaint is that the zipper was stuck, thankfully only an inch from the top and I have long hair. Eventually one of my friends got it undone, but she figured it out only because she had a degree in design and had experience with that sort of thing.

The length was great though. I'm 6' tall and use to dresses being way too short and having to wear black tights but this worked well. It also has POCKETS which is always a plus.

Pockets were an added bonus. I though the material was thinner and stretchier than expected and the low back zipper kept slipping down (due to wear?). I did not think this was the most flattering dress with the diagonal seams on the top and the damask or paisley pattern accentuating hips. A fitted or snugger size may have lessened this effect. I agree it runs small but it is stretchy so I could have kept my normal size. Thought it was too big in the bust and the back stood away from me.

The color is more on the blue side than photos show, but I still got away with black heels. I did have some issue with the zipper coming down when I moved because there is no hook and eye, but I just had a friend stick a safety pin through the zipper and it kept it from moving down.

Cons: The cut is not quite as flattering as a fit and flare, the zipper does fall open 1/8 of an inch at a time but it is nothing to worry about. The back gaped when I stood with proper posture. The thickness of the dress is heavy. Do not wear this for a summer wedding but spring and winter are perfect.","June 15, 2015","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA31","Annemarie","Nice, but a little conservative . . .","This dress was a substitute for the dress I had originally reserved for a wedding. I went with a different style, since this was a little more conservative than I was looking for. It is very nice quality, and the fabric has a pretty sparkle to it that you can't see in photos. It fit me nicely from under my chest down, but was a little roomy up top. The pockets are a neat addition. I am small in the hips, so those with a more curvy figure may need to go up a size.","May 14, 2015","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA31","Elise","Perfect dress for a dinner date","This dress made me feel like a million bucks. The fabric is really beautiful, and the pattern is one of a kind. The material is very form fitting and doesn't leave much room to stretch. It's tight in the hips and across the collar bone. The length hits right above the knee, and the hem tapers in. For those with wider hips (like myself), I would suggest going up in size.","April 23, 2015","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA31","Amanda","Gorgeous fabric!","I typically wear a 2 or 4 in RTR dresses; however after reading the reviews I sized up for a 6. I'm so glad I did because it fit perfectly! There is very little stretch in the material, and no slit up the back. If the widest part of your body is your hips (pear) definitely size up. The fabric on the dress is amazing. So shiny and rich looking. I received a ton of compliments.","April 6, 2015","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA31","Allison","Fits like a glove, very flattering","I wore this dress to my engagement party (cocktail attire) and it was perfect. It definitely runs small - I usually order a 2 and a 4 from RTR, but after reading the reviews of this dress I ordered a 4 and a 6 and wore the 6, with little to no room for error; the material has no give. That being said, if this dress fits you, it fits perfectly. The cut is very flattering, particularly if you are comfortable with your waist and stomach but less comfortable with your legs. Overall I felt great in this dress and I got compliments on it all night.","January 10, 2015","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA31","Rita","I got tons of compliments, and it's appropriate for a work affair.","The dress fits pretty true to size, I did size up, but that's because there isn't a lot of stretch in the fabric and I have a big chest and butt. It is much shinier in person, so it's very dressy even though that doesn't show up in the pictures very much. It still looks good in pics just not as shiny. I wore it to a formal work Christmas party because I don't believe in wearing cleavage at work functions, but even though it's very conservative I got a lot of compliments from women and men. It's a very pretty dress. My second rental with RTR and I will rent again!","December 16, 2014","Party"

The material is thick and forgiving, and I think I could have sized down and been happy with the fit, in spite of my wide hips and larger-sized arms that are sometimes challenging to fit. The slit is not too high on a 6' tall female, and I even put some shorts underneath so I could have a few more cocktails. The best part is being able to dress it up or down with accessories.

The dress hit me right below the knees which is where I wanted it to come. It was a little tight where the elastic waist band was. The top was a little big and bunched where the triangle cutout was but the dress was still really cute.","July 21, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW417","Kelly","Beautiful, yet comfortable dress!","Got soo many compliments on this dress! It was classy with a hint of sexy. Pros: comfortable, able to wear strapless bra, not too long (I'm short), beautiful design and cut to flatter natural waist Cons: may have to size up if you have a larger chest (I had very little extra room in size 4 with an A cup), definitely need slightly higher heels due to length if you're short, and that's it because this dress is awesome!","July 5, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW417","RTR Customer","Great dress for a wedding on a warm day!","Loved the unique look of the dress and received multiple compliments. The only drawback was I could not find a strapless bra that wasn't visible through the cutout. Having a smaller chest, this was not a real issue for me and I was able to wear a backless sticky bra. But I imagine this could be challenging for someone with a larger chest size.","May 28, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW417","Tiffany","The dress was extremely flattering on my figure.","This dress is flattering on hourglass figures, and it is a dark blue not black. The elastic waistline was the biggest bonus for this dress because I didn’t feel confined and it breaths very easily. I initially planned to wear the size ten but my boobs and chest area are in the between size, so the chest area of the dress was a tad snug, thus the size ten semi-fit overall. I ended up wearing the size twelve. The size twelve was a tad bit loose in the chest area again because I'm in the in-between size. The only drawback on this dress was the “zipper” there was no catch to prevent the zipper from going down. I did not realize this minor dilemma until I was at the event and in some pictures taken and I could see the zipper creeping down. It was a tad bit annoying and knowing that now, I would have used a safety pin or something to prevent that from happening. However, the dress overall was a hit the cross style on the upper half is eye-catching and is what prompted me to pick this dress in particular. If you’re a big fan of fit and flare, I highly recommend this dress.","April 10, 2019","Formal Affair"

I'm normally between a 6 and 8, depending on how much the dress has room in the bust area. I read the other reviews though saying it ran small so rented an 8 and 10, I ended up in the 10.

At 5'1"" it was a but baggy in the torso area even after pulling the dress down. Since the keyhole torso is the star of this dress, because it was too long there, it sagged in the front and back, and in the back ended up covering up the cute cutout.

I couldn't have fit a bra under this but the material was tight enough to keep everything in place. The side zipper area had stretch which saved the day for me. I probably could have worn an 8 with more comfort. I wore it to a family wedding & it photographed very well! It feels expensive & is not cheaply made.","December 14, 2018","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW417","RTR Customer","Classy cutouts on this navy blue dress!","I rented a 4 and 6 because I’m usually a 4, but ended up wearing the size 6. The size 4 would have fit but my chest was too big (size 32DD) and there was no way the zipper could close because of my boobs. The 6 fit well and the material was supportive so I don’t even need a bra. The only problem was now the shoulder was a little too loose so the dress slid down and exposed side boob on both sides. I used fashion tape to tape the dress to my skin and it worked and stayed in place all night. I'm short (5'0"") and this was mid-shin on me or slightly lower. I loved this dress. It was comfortable to wear because the waist had some stretch and the material felt nice but wasn’t heavy at all. Showed a little skin but was appropriate for a wedding. Lots of compliments and I felt so pretty!","October 29, 2018","Wedding"

The keyhole falls in a flattering spot, and the waistband is pretty stretchy. I will say the 8 was so tight I didn't need to wear a bra, which was actually kind of nice, but if you're between sizes I would go up. There was plenty of room in the skirt.

The material is thin and wonderful for a hot summer day. Since the waist is stretchy and there is a tie around the neck, there's a lot of flexibility in terms of sizing. I wore a size 2 that fit well in the chest/waist area, but I ended up using fashion tape to tape up about 2 inches of length. In retrospect, I probably could have sized down to a 0. I ended up not wearing a bra with this, but the dress is definitely strapless bra friendly. Since the material is thin, the skirt is relatively see-through when there is light behind you, so I wore a slip underneath the dress. A pair of wedges and dangly earrings completed the look which transitioned well from daytime to cocktail hour to dinner with friends.","September 30, 2016","Large"

The sizing is a bit tricky: when putting it on, the waste band feels tight like it won't go over your bum (lol)- I think the zipper should be longer so the opening is wider (but can't change that now). The band also feels a bit tight on the chest area. It wasn't unbearable but you could feel the tension after wearing the dress for some time. I wouldn't size up though, bc I feel that the rest of the dress would then become too big.

I'm always between XS-S and was happy I rented both sizes as a 4-day rental despite being a RTR unlimited member. Forget zipping it, I couldn't get the XS over my hips! The small fit, but even this size was very tight, required assistance to zip up, and prevented me from taking deep breaths. Even so, I weirdly enjoyed the sexy, ""sucked and tucked"" feeling once it was on, LOL. This dress is looong. Granted I'm short, but it would have been much more flattering on someone 5'7"" or taller. <RTR seriously needs to start offering at least a small selection of pants, skirts, and dresses in petite sizes, even if it's limited availability--am I right!?> Overall, I actually really liked this dress.

As a mom that still has (and probably always will have) a little extra in the mid-section, I'm particular when it comes to how things fit around the abdomen. I'm pretty slender, but am a 36c, so it can be difficult to find a good fit for all of my features. But this dress fit great! I was able to wear a strapless bra and bikini underwear without worry because the fabric is thick and hides lines well. The side rouching helps hide extra mid-region weight and the slightly off-center slit added a little sexiness. The length was perfect; long enough to look classy and show just enough with the slit when sitting. Any shorter and the slit would have become an issue while sitting for dinner. I ended up wearing brown slingbacks, but I think nude or black would also pair well with this dress.","April 29, 2019","Formal Affair"

It's a thick yet stretchy fabric which liked. The small fit but it kept riding up when I walked so I wore the medium. The medium still rode up a little and I found myself tugging it down a lot (I'm also not used to wearing short dresses anymore so that may have been part of it!). The sleeves were a bit long but it was a cute dress overall. Just an 'OK' choice when pregnant though due to the riding up issue.","January 22, 2020","Date"

It was perfect for a cold fall date night. I wore the small and didn't even try on the medium. I liked the balance of shorter skirt with high neck. You do have to slip it over your head which is a slight inconvenience, but not horrible. The material is on the thicker side, but there are black sort of sheer lines throughout which I did not realize were there as you can't see that in the pics! I tried to choose a photo where you could barely sort of see it in the chest area! You could see my bra through it but not significantly and definitely not enough to where I felt needed an undershirt. I did pair with tights and tall black boots. May have been classier with all black tights, but I liked the way it turned out. It was comfortable and I didn't have any trouble eating with the sleeves. I mean as long as you're eating with silverware you should be fine, just watch reaching across table for anything (like feeding a bite to your significant other). I chose to not wear a necklace, I liked the clean look better. Just earrings and my rings. I am glad I went out on a limb and rented this dress. I can't say that I'd rent it again, because there's so many out there, but I did like it and fiancé sure did too.","October 21, 2017","Date"

I am 5'3, D cup but honestly, it strapped my chest down and was fine there. The bottom part was pretty unflattering. I wore it anyways but I wish I hadn't. I was extremely uncomfortable all night.

Overall, super flattering, beautifully made, and fun and classy for any event. The neck goes up pretty high as well, more than i thought it would. Definitely plan to wear with earrings and no necklace! I got the small and the medium as I typically wear a small, but the reviews sounded like I would be uncomfortable in a small... which I was.

The only thing I would note about sizing is that it runs about 1 size large. I almost always wear a size 4 and wore the size 2 for this dress. This dress is also meant for ladies bustier than myself. I am a 32-B and the bust of the dress was gaping on me.

I was a bit surprised that it wasn't a better fit and would recommend sizing down to others.

Running true to size , I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is free and comfy from the waist down it works best for all cup sizes and can also be worn with a strapless or no bra. From the waist down , this style has a loose free fit. At 5’2”, the length stops me at mid thigh length , with gold or black pair of heels will complete your outfit! Adding a fun handbag will settle this unique dress with a fashionable touch.","August 17, 2018","True to Size"

Compliments galore.","I loved the fabric, halter style cut, flare skirt, and the pockets were perfect for the night. Only drawback- the bust is roomy even though the rest of the dress fit very well. I wore a sticky, backless bra and because of the roomy bust was a bit scared to make any sudden movements with the backless feature! I'm a typical size 12 and was surprised the bust had some room left, since I'm a 38B. So that's something to be aware of, even though the waist area fit me to a ""t"". Two hooks hold this dress on after you zip it up just below the open back-- one hook above the zipper at small of back and one hook behind the neck, where the straps meet. Otherwise, a killer dress that was so much fun to wear.","April 17, 2018","Large"

For those of you who also dislike carrying clutches at formal events, I have one word for you: pockets.

Got told I looked like ""an actual gem"" and received a ton of compliments from both men and women the whole night! I selected this dress because I wanted something that would look good while dancing, and it did not disappoint. This dress has great movement; the classic silhouette and the lightest touch of sensuality at the back made me feel absolutely amazing the whole night. I was sad to have to send it back, but incredibly happy with the experience I had. Will definitely use RTR in the future!","March 26, 2019","Large"

I ended up not wearing it. I normally wear a 14/16 and wore the 14, but there's a lot of stretch. I probably could have fit into the 12. If the neckline was a deep V or the dress was a little shorter I'd have considered wearing it.","February 24, 2019","Wedding"

Too many compliments to count!","The dress fit perfectly (Size 8) and was just the right length. The sequins are very heavy and that made zipping it up difficult (required help) but once in, it was super comfortable. I had zero issues with the sequins scratching and I was able to wear a regular bra with back extenders that pulled it down so my bra did not show in the key hole back. It was ideal for the Gala and it really dazzled when I was making a presentation under the spotlights. Highly recommend: Perfect price, perfect fit, perfect for the occasion.","January 27, 2019","True to Size"

It dips a bit low in the back, which may show your bra (as it did mine). I just had to do a bit of adjusting on my end to get it not to show. That was my only hiccup. Other than that, super pleased with the quality and the length.","January 7, 2019","True to Size"

Only negatives were no pockets and a difficult zipper.","January 5, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM239","RTR Customer","Hello gorgeous! Over the moon fabulous!","I ordered a dress from RTR because I had gained weight and was not about to have any size 14 in my closet. This dress was RTR for a yacht party and I wanted to look stunning, fabulous, gorgeous and wear a head-turning dress. This dress accomplished all of the above! The reviews that had been written were very helpful. As stated in one review the zipper did stick a little bit trying to zip it up. The dress is a ""roomy"" size 14 meaning if you gain weight you will still be able to wear it. Some reviews had stated ""fits larger than usual"". I was hoping for a ""runs large fit"" 14 because the 16 was not available. The 14 fit snugly but as I said I had gained weight from being a size 12. Also my bust size is 38DD. A 16 would have fit loosely and not as snug in the bodice area. A 16 would have had a longer look. I was over the moon and back happy that the 14 fit because this was the dress I wanted to wear and the alternate dress was tight and I could not wear the alternate dress. This dress is very comfortable to dance in. I received many compliments. Will rent again and post before and after pictures when I lose weight. LOL I cannot wait to RTR again. This was my first rental and I did not know what to expect. The dress was expected at 8 p.m. on a Friday and arrived by UPS at 7:55 p.m. on that Friday. I was so happy! I hope anyone who RTRs this dress will have the same fabulous experience I did.","November 22, 2018","True to Size"

I would usually wear a dress size 4 or 6. But as the reviews suggested I have sized down and ordered 2 and 4. Ended up wearing size 2. It was nicely tight on me which made it look much better than size 4. The material it self is surprisingly stretchy, super shiny, length was very pleasant, and it looks elegant enough for a formal ever. My husband was wearing a golden bow-tie and several people commented that we are the best looking couple of the party. Highly recommend!","November 14, 2018","Large"

I went a size up because I have a tendency to always wish I had a little more breathing room but with this dress I regretted not wearing the 14. You can't wear a bra and so I think the smaller size would have held me a little tighter but that would have been the desired effect due to no bra. Regardless, got tons of compliments and felt great!","November 2, 2018","Wedding"

The dress was fun, SPARKLY and perfect for my costume. It's a little itchy but I wore it with arm tights to keep my arms warmer in the NYC cold and that made it more comfortable. I also added a black ribbon to cinch the waist since it was a little too big. The back is open which was perfect for my wings. You definitely won't go unnoticed in the gold dress.","October 29, 2018","Party"

I ordered a 10 with a backup size of an 8 and I definitely could have worn a 6. You definitely cannot wear a regular bra with this dress - it will show. It might be a bit tricker of a dress for women with big busts, but I made it work. I'm also very short, and this dress was a bit long, but I was expecting that, and with heels it was perfect.","October 8, 2018","Large"

I ended up wearing the size eight with plenty of room to spare around my ribcage. Even though the dress was still a little roomy around the waist, the weight of the sequins helped disguise this, and I was able to eat to my heart's content! I really enjoyed this dress, and I am considering renting the green version for a holiday party this year. I might test out the size 6 just to see how tight I can get it to fit...","October 8, 2018","Large"

The top was very loose and I forgot fashion tape so I was constantly pulling it up, but I would do it all over again to wear this dress. The material is thick and warm so it's great for cool fall weddings. Is very warm and doesn't breathe much so I wouldn't wear it on a hot summer day in fear of sweat marks showing. Overall this dress was a show stopper! I loved it and would wear it again in a heartbeat. I originally ordered the 46 which fit but was a little loose, the 44 hugged all the curves in the right places and made me feel more confident.

I actually did not originally choose this dress, but it was sent to me because the size I wanted in the dress I chose wasn't available. Despite the stress of that, the stylist at RTR did a great job choosing this stunning dress for me. The seams on the inside of the dress are a little annoying/uncomfortable, but this can easily be remedied with the right undergarments. I strongly recommend wearing a strapless Demi-bra with the dress due to the cut-outs at the top of the bust area. That way you won't worry about your bra showing all night. This dress is very forgiving and I would say enhancing to your figure. Totally recommend not only the dress, but the designer.","October 8, 2018","Wedding"

I'm short (5'3) and fairly hourglass shaped, and I've discovered depending on the maker, I wear a size 2-6 in dresses. This fit beautifully at a 4. The material is oddly kind of like a wetsuit, but looks gorgeous and flatters the figure. I HIGHLY recommend this dress. However, I would also recommend a longer rental period and more than the recommended 1-2 days before the event. The day before my order was supposed to ship, my backup size was unavailable, and the stylist chosen backup was literally a dress where the to was a bikini covered in lace. Not at all suited for a large busted female. Then, when I chose a new backup, the order was incorrectly set to a dress with a very similar name (same designer, but one was named the Tessie and the other was named the Kate, I believe.) THEN, neither my original nor my backup were able to arrive the day prior as planned; both were set to arrive the DAY OF the event. To top it all off, the day of the event, only this dress (my backup) arrived! My original dress ARRIVED THE DAY AFTER MY EVENT. Yup. That happened.","April 20, 2018","Formal Affair"

The pictures make the top look conservative yet sexy and while the top was extremely sheer it was just that and you couldn't wear a bra although it didn't feel securely fitted. I went with the 8 and felt like the top could've been more fitted and sultry looking but it ended up just looking a bit baggy and matronly on my petite frame, even with my large matronly breast-milk filled bosoms (haha) which I'd assumed would make the top more fitted. Anyway it didn't really wow me or my husband and I didn't get any compliments on it--which is rare for a rtr outfit--might look better on taller women however.","December 8, 2017","Large"

Running true to size I would say size down for backup as it had a comfortable fit throughout the midsection. If hips are your problem area this is a great dress. At 5’ 7” this was definitely the right length as it hit just above my knee. I would wear this gown to a winter sorority formal or a wedding. The sheer paneling is straight off the runway and doesn’t need much more than a pop clutch and simple heels to wow your date and your friends at any event.","March 10, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN126","Kelsey","Modest, yet sexy dress","This is a beautiful dress. The mesh neckline makes it seem modest, but still sexy. Regarding the fit, the top was a little loose so I would recommend sizing down for your backup. From the waist down, the dress was a little more fitted with no stretch. The beading adds a nice touch of glamour, and didn't irritate or scratch my skin in any way. I had a little trouble reaching the zipper in the back, but no more than a usual. I would wear a slightly padded strapless bra to fill out the bust because it was a little loose. This might help keep the shoulders in place as well. The waist was more fitted but still allowed room. I probably would not normally choose a plunging neckline, but because of the mesh top, I felt very comfortable. One of the shoulders slipped a little, but with a tighter fit or fashion tape, I don't think it would be a problem. The dress hit directly above the knee and stayed in place well, even when sitting. The full skirt allows for plenty of movement. Because of the embellishments, this dress would be perfect with simple stud earrings and black heels. Definitely a great dress for a fancier event! As for my measurements; 13"" from shoulder to shoulder, 13"" from shoulder to waist, 20"" from waist to knee, 17"" from hip to knee.","February 7, 2017","True to Size"

I had searched for a dress to wear locally, but nothing caught my eye. I had recently gained a few pounds and was worried that anything I ordered was going to cling to me in all the wrong places. Lucky for me that wasn't the case. The material and shape of this dress accentuate the assets of a curvy figure while minimizing the flaws. My legs even looked longer and thinner! The material is a little heavy- don't know if it would be the best choice for an outdoor, August wedding, but it was really comfortable. Got so many compliments.

If you're not going to wear heels then you might want to use the sticky tape that comes with it to shorten it because it might be too long if you're like me.

I got the 4 and the 6 and didn't notice a difference between them...Both felt tight around my rib cage/stomach (where the ribbon falls), but somehow the 4 was slightly more comfortable. It's possible that the size difference matters at the bust, but with my small chest (32B) I didn't notice. Wouldn't recommend for large chests or waists, but it hides all pouch in the gut area.

Both fit, but like some of the other reviews mentioned, the waist can be a little tight. So I wore the 2 to give myself that extra space. Wore all night in a seated event and felt comfortable and gorgeous.","January 30, 2017","True to Size"

The straps were fine, but as others have said, one of the straps was loose. I'll order the 10 to see how that fits, as it's *so close* to perfect. Beautiful fabric, color, and cut.","January 10, 2020","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG60","Marissa","This dress is a SHOW STOPPER!","I originally ordered the 6P but it was just a little too short and a bit snug (still would have been able to wear it) But being that I ordered the back up in 8R that was perfect! Just a little loose where the back straps are. Other than that this dress is great! I received so many compliments on the color and fit! Wore this for a formal outdoor wedding held in September but can see this being an all year round dress! Once again the color is stunning and the dress is a SHOW STOPPER!","September 18, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG60","Alli","Started off rocky but ended up being ok","I had originally ordered this dress in a size 4R which probably would’ve been my perfect fit, but unfortunately three days before my event I was notified that the size 4 was no longer available to ship, my backup size was 6P because there was no 6R available and I was also given two other styles of dresses to try but I wasn’t a fan of either so I tried the 6P. It fit but was not very snug in the bust so I was constantly having to pull it up but it was also too short so I was having to constantly make sure the dress was pulled up enough in the bust but not showing my feet. I also wore a two inch heel instead of my usual 4’. All in all it was a success, I received countless compliments all night and the color was amazing on my skin tone.","July 26, 2019","True to Size"

I'm 6' tall so I always get nervous about the length when ordering online. The Long was plentyyy long which I was so happy about! The dress hit the floor and there was even room for small heels if I wanted to but I chose to wear sandals. I usually wear a size 6 but there was a delivery issue and this was my backup size. It actually fit great everywhere but the top! It was pretty loose and I had to be mindful of it all night. I safety pinned it which helped a little. I wear a size C cup but bustier women may not have the same problem! Other than that - no complaints. I would totally rent again","April 24, 2019","True to Size"

I am 5'9 and the dress was still super long even with 3 inch heels on. Also, they didn't have a 6L available, so I wore the 8L.

Material was thicker than i expected which turned out great as it was a form fitting dress and that thickness was more ""forgiving"" for being 3months postpartum. Given the style of the dress, the thicker material didn't make it too hot for the weather. The top also fit great (tight/snug enough) which I was worried about. I received so many compliments and am so happy that I selected this dress and this color when i would have normally chosen black.","February 15, 2019","True to Size"

The off the shoulder straps were not at all uncomfortable, the fabric of the dress was quality, it was gorgeous. The only thing I didn't appreciate was the zipper clearly was worn: it used to be black but after so much wear it's silver metal is quite obvious. But who's looking at that, trust me, no one. When you're wearing this dress everyone is looking at you and not your zipper. And I mean everyone. It's a gorgeous head turner.","December 14, 2018","Formal Affair"

I'm 5'2 so wearing 4.5 inch stilettos made this dress the perfect length. The sleeves had no trouble staying in place. If my boobs were any bigger, I could tell how tight it'd get. The fabric is thick and good quality. Also, RTR sent my dresses 4 days early because I couldn't switch out a style about 2 weeks ago with another gown due to it being rented out already.

All of the reviews were really helpful and the majority of them said it ran small so I went up in size. I also got it in Long. I couldn't have worn heels higher than an inch with this dress though or you would have seen my whole foot. It ended up being just fine with me since i'm not a high heel person. I wore these cute red kitten heels with it and the dress barley brushed the ground. The fit was great, my only negative would be that the material wrinkles easily. Just from the 10 minute car ride to the event made the dress super wrinkly across my lap. I spritzed a little water on it and brushed it out and it was fine.","December 7, 2018","Small"

I was able to wear a strapless bra but it wasn't necessary. The length was right at the knees and I am 5'4 flat footed. The fabric itself was a lot lighter and less structured than it appears in photos which makes it comfy on warm summer days.

I liked it but I didn't end up wearing it because it wasn't appropriate for the event. Normally E&J dresses run small on me but because I have a small chest, this dress ran true to size. It's also easy to adjust because of the tie in back. The material isn't stretchy but it's very flattering. It is on the short side but just enough to make it flirty.","June 25, 2017","Party"

But the arm holes on the dress came down farther than I expected, so I had find a bra that wouldn't show there. If I would have gone a size up, who knows what the arm hole situation would have been like...

The photo highlights the problem area. For whatever reason the stitching around the bust puckers in a way that only 80s-era Madonna would appreciate. I even tried wearing my favorite smooth bra... and well.. you can see the result. This was disappointing because other reviewers really liked this dress, but when I went back to look at their photos to see if I missed something I realized their dresses had a similar issue.

I only knocked it down a star because of the weird armpit gap (you can see it in the pic) and the size 2 seemed to have many threads that stuck out just from people wearing it. Other than that, it was a great dress and I received compliments from all the military wives. The simple, modest, silhouette was perfect for the event, but made it stand out (in a good way) with the pattern.

One thing I thought was awkward at first was the cut of the arm pit. It did help with range of motion, in that the dress did not ride up when I lifted my arms, so that was nice.

I like a unique piece, so tho one arm drape was perfect. I like material that doesn't stretch as it keeps everything in its place. There is boning in the front that also helped keep everything sculpted. This was a perfect fit. You can see the length might be a bit too short for some. The hem was off the floor with my 3-4inch heels. I didn't think it looked bad.","November 5, 2017","Wedding"

It was really flattering on my frame and stayed up due to the one shoulder and rubber lining at the top of the bust. Unfortunately it seemed a bit thin and stretched out around the lower stomach area but you really weren't able to tell because of the ruffling and the solid black color.

I was a little rushed when trying it on (I was doing the Express Try-On at the San Francisco store) and realized I tried on my backup size 6 instead of my usual size 4.

The band around the ribcage was just too snug, even in my normal size... Going up a size would have meant a looser fit around my chest, so it's a tricky fit.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS53","Sarah","Turns you into a swan!","This is a gorgeous dress that's a pleasure to wear - but it's most beautiful quality is the way it moves! The fabric is light, but hangs with just enough weight for the ruffles to flow elegantly down your figure when you're standing still. Then, when you move, all those scrumptious ruffles flow and flutter like butterflies! It's a stunning effect. I received many compliments. The only tricky part of the dress is the bodice: if you're large-busted like me, it can look a bit amorphous across the front without a bra/the right bra. Aside from that, this dress is flawless: beautiful quality, superb details (an inner ribbon with a clip, to help the defined natural waist stay in the right place!), gorgeous movement, and a bit of give in the fabric to allow the dress to mold to your curves as it warms with wear. I also CANNOT SAY ENOUGH about RtR's service - absolutely extraordinary. When does one ever have the experience of feeling like a company bent over backwards to ensure an excellent customer experience? But that's certainly what they did for me. Thank you SO MUCH, RtR!!! <3","June 24, 2017","Party"

The color of this style is even more beautiful in person, and the fabric is just gorgeous. Running true to size, we absolutely recommend sizing up for your backup, as there is no stretch and this is fitted throughout. The bust of this style is best for A-C cup sizes and we recommend wearing a strapless bra or no bra at all. At 5'5"" this hit about two inches above the floor at its longest. I would pair this with black strappy sandals and a pair of gold earrings.","June 9, 2017","True to Size"

First, the halter neck is not adjustable, and the buttons made it too loose for me. Also, the stomach area is tighter than I would expect for a 6, so I would size up.

So I took a risk and my gosh did it pay off. This dress is such a beautiful color, and the asymmetrical design lets you transition from an afternoon ceremony to a night reception. The side zipper is stiff in one section of the dress, but that's the only complaint. If you're thinking about it- do it!","October 18, 2017","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS53","Jasmine","flowy, gorgeous, comfortable and flattering","I wore this to a wedding in San Francisco and there was a breeze that would make the dress dance and flow without lifting up too high to be embarrassing. I loved the effect overall. Also, I had to climb into the bonus back seat of an SUV by clambering over the normal backseat and two car seats and I could move in that dress without hindrance as if I were wearing yoga pants, that was a pleasant surprise. I wore a normal strapless bra and the dress itself has a sticky border and two types of clasps on the side that allowed it to stay in place without ever needing to be adjusted or pulled back up into position. I think this was my favorite dress so far based on the comfort, the look, the color, and the wearability. The color was like a deep red wine, better in person than the pictures. Shows off arms well so if that is your forte and you don't wanna suck in your abs all night, this is the dress for you. It has a good cut that gives you shape but is not too specific around the abdomen so you don't need to be flat as a board to look awesome. This was also the perfect length for someone my height who wore 3 inch heels. Did not step on dress at all which is a little unusual when I rent long dresses from RTR.","October 5, 2017","True to Size"

I am only giving 4 stars because the 0 was too small in the waist, and the 2 was too big in the torso. I ended up wearing the 2, but it was just a little loose (it was not in danger of falling down though because of the halter top). It also got pretty wrinkled and I didn't have time to steam it.","September 12, 2017","True to Size"

The longest part of the asymmetrical hem reached the floor and the top was far to big and blousy. The straps that go around the neck have buttons on them, so if you hope to be able to tape a strap that's too long (like i had hoped), think again. The cut of this dress just didn't fit right on my body. This dress would be perfect for a true hourglass (I'm a pear).

It was a perfect mix of sexy and class for very understated gorgeousness! Loved wearing it! My bra straps just barely tucked away to hide under it, but it was close, and there is a chance for them to easily slip.

I'm pretty much a medium, size 4 across the board, but even the small is too long in the torso (or maybe because I'm a small 34A and don't fill it out up top). If I pull it all the way down, you can see the bra. I'm tempted to just buy it and have it tailored to make the shoulder straps sewn 1.5 inches shorter because it looks a lot more flattering that way. I love how the ruffles are just at the hips so it flares out... super flirty & flattering at that part!

The front lining of the skirt did hang past the outer skirt a bit but I just pulled it up and ticket it against the waist without any issue. Top stayed in place and skirt had a nice twirl during hours of dancing. I got compliments all night long from all the other ladies. I did feel very exposed in the cleavage department but I was going all out for this wedding so a little bit of skin was fine with me.

It was a bit sexy for my liking, so I ended up going with an alternate dress for my event. I think this would be cute on someone with a smaller chest/smaller frame OR someone who is looking for a sexy low-cut dress. I don't think it looked bad on my body type, I just wasn't expecting it to be so chest. I would possibly rent again if I sized up or was going to a less formal event. The fabric is nice and the top of the dress is well-structured through the waist. No bra necessary, which is good considering the open back.

My main concern was that it was going to be way too long on me. I normally wear between a size 2 and 4, however, the reviews I read were helpful in that they warned about a tight waist and to go a size up, which I did. I ended up ordering a 4 and a 6. Although the 4 did fit (meaning the dress zipped up), it did not look all that flattering in the back. The 6 definitely fit better and I was able to breathe easier. Throughout the event, the dress was easy to move around in and I had many compliments (I was even told the dress gave me the 'perfect twirl' while dancing). I didn't have to wear a bra with this dress either and my 'girls' felt very supported.","July 24, 2018","Small"

The dress is so expertly made that it was very full coverage and supportive for someone of my bust size. I was extremely comfortable without a bra. I wasn't self-conscious about the amount of cleavage or worried about falling out of the dress at all. The halter was also the perfect length, which is rare for someone of my height with a short torso. The fit was just so perfect and comfortable and slimming. It was perfectly tight around my waist without being uncomfortable or cutting into my sides when I sat. The fabric moved really well with my body. Length was perfect too, which is also rare for someone of my height (5'1""). I would buy this dress if I could! I wore a size 4, which was technically my backup size, and it was a perfect fit. I waver between 2-4 depending on the style/fit of the dress. I would suggest getting your normal size and a size up, especially if you are busty like I am.","February 4, 2018","True to Size"

You can tell it is excellently made. I am usually a 10 and ordered a 10 and a 12 and even the 12 was a little snug, but did fit. I would recommend getting your second size bigger though. The problem I had is that it is WAY more revealing than the model, who clearly has no chest. It did not leave very much to the imagination, coming way more into a scooping V than this sleek one shown on the model. I was at a wedding and felt very self-conscious about the amount of chest I was showing. I wear a C cup, so I don't have a particularly large chest for my height and size (5'8, 10), and still felt it was way too much.

I'm a full C cup, so there was a good bit of cleavage but not too much. I did have to wear a size up from my normal size b/c the rib cage is tight and has no stretch.

I had selected to pick up at the Chicago RTR store to try it on, and the 18R actually fit like a glove, but found a big snag in the lace so unfortunately had to wear the larger size, even though the smaller one fit wonderfully (but it wasn't that much of a size difference).","September 23, 2019","Wedding"

Runs large!!","Summary - Highly recommend, would definitely rent again or even buy this dress. I wasn't sure what size to order since I just had a baby (okay he is 10 months old, but still!). Pre-baby I would usually wear a 4. Originally when I went to order the dress I was going to order a 4 and a 6. I am glad I read the reviews. It definitely runs large, which is a great boast to your ego. I ended up wearing a 2 COMFORTABLY to the event. For us ""shorties"" it is a bit long on the tampered hem. So the sample pic shows it several inches above the ankle. Mine was right at the ankle. Not ideal, if I was buying the dress I would have had it altered, but for a 1 time wear, not a deal breaker.","April 23, 2019","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CST9","Julie","Nice quality for good price!","I wasn’t sure how to dress for the event, so I went with this dress because the material looked nice and rich, the color suitable for formal or less formal, and I thought the v neck would be flattering without being too flashy. I was correct in all of those things! The straps were a bit long, so it didn’t give me any lift at 34a/b, and that was with a strapless bra though it’s definitely a thick enough dress to go without if fit allows. I read another review that said smaller sizes should rent a size smaller for their backup and I went against that. I was wrong haha I think the size 2 would have been perfect for me, though the 4 definitely worked. For the price, this dress is a total steal.

When it came, the fabric is not satin, it's smooth and slightly thick. It's a true navy blue. I'm 5'7"" and it fell right below the knee. I felt beautiful in it. However, here's where it's disappointing. First it's NOT RTR fault. Let's make that clear. It's how the dress is made. The straps are useless. I tried pinning it, I tried using fashion tape, I tried tucking it, nothing worked. If your NOT 6' with a long torso! Those straps will not stay on. And no it won't look good letting it fall. In the end...I pinned it. It was tough. But I made it work. I loved the dress. And a lot of stares, but no I won't rent this dress again. But I will be back.","May 31, 2019","Wedding"

The cutout/tie waist adjusts to your waist size. The shoulder seams are wider/oversized and the top stretched nicely over my 32E chest. The a-line skirt cut had room for my wide-ish hips and felt flattering on my extra belly weight with high waisted, control top panties (you could see belly button outline and VPL with lowrise bikini cut panties). The cutout came right at the bottom of my bra - I had to pin it so when I raised my arms it wouldn't show.","June 5, 2019","Large"

I liked the style overall, the lace top is cute and shorts are comfortable. The fit was OK on me - I wore the 4 which fit my upper body well, but the waist was awkwardly high and the length was very short on me (I'm 5'11). The beauty of the romper is that no matter how short the legs are, you never need to pull it down like a short dress. I didn't want to size up because the 6 was just a baggier fit on me.

I paired it with gold open top heels, a black + gold clutch and underneath a nude strapless bra and a black lace bottom, matching the scheme haha, but also because I had to ask for help at restroom time to unzip, I will definitely rent again and wished I owed it.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JAJ5","Catherine","Ridiculously Comfortable. Work to work party!","I wore this for a work holiday event (and for the entire day at work leading up to it with a loose sweater). The dress was extremely comfortable - wore a size SR and am 5'7"", curvy 135 - it did stretch out just a little throughout the day, but held its shape. I'm normally a 4/6, and have a tiny waist compared to my caboose, so the MR gapped in the back and was not nearly as flattering. Normal undergarments, just crisscrossed my bra straps. Rent this dress!","December 15, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JAJ5","Leslie","AWESOME flattering maternity fit!","Wore this to a rehearsal dinner when I was 7 months pregnant, and it was a GREAT choice! Definitely stretchy enough to accommodate my bump - and comfortably/flatteringly so! People even told me they couldn't tell I was pregnant unless I turned to the side (I think because the fit of the dress was so nice!). I usually wear an XS/0 in dresses, but I sized up to a S for comfort, which I'm glad I did. I ordered a M for my backup size, but that would've been far too large elsewhere in the dress; as it was, the size S was even a little loose in the arms for me and hit me below the knee. Bonus: being able to wear a normal bra with this dress was really nice at 7 months pregnant ;) P.S. - the measurements I have in my profile are pre-maternity. At the time I wore this dress in Size S, I was probably more like a pregnant 34D and 130 lbs.","November 5, 2018","True to Size"

Was hoping to wear this for GNO, but the arms were too big.","The fabric was thicker so it felt slimming and well-made, looks like more than a $200 retail dress. Unfortunately, the sleeves were baggy/loose on me. The silhouette would have been more flattering if the sleeves had been tighter as in the picture. Not sure if this particular dress was stretched out or if it's made that way, but I chose to return it.","October 29, 2018","True to Size"

I wanted to wear the size 8 but it's a little bit tight w muffin top effect so I settled on the size 10. The dress looked like it's meant more for a busty woman bec the front is a bit loose on me.

It is slightly heavy but the boning in the top kept it from falling down. I wore a strapless bra due to the top being slightly large but with the bra it was a perfect fit.

Got lots of compliments on the color and the skirts. I wore with 4"" heels; the regular did not drag on the ground with those on but the back skimmed it when I was without shoes.","July 16, 2019","True to Size"

I love the length and the fit! The color is gorgeous! And bonus, it has pockets! I got SO many complements. I'm a 12 in regular clothing but almost always a 14 in RTR.

Of the three dresses I got, it was the only one that fit so I was really glad I liked it. It fit well, if not a bit snuggly on my ribs, but loose on my bust. It has more of a high-low feel than you can tell in the back and the colors are a brighter than they appear. The biggest issue I had was it was difficult to zip even though it fit fine. Also, the bust lining was popping out giving me a few sharp surprises throughout the night.","June 3, 2019","True to Size"

Would totally order it again and again if I could. I was banking on needing to go up a size in the dress, so I ordered my backup bigger. I ended up wearing the smaller size (12R) because it fit better around my chest. The larger size kept sliding down and was not supportive. With a strapless bra on, it fit perfectly. The fabric is a little heavy, so I got hot throughout the night but I think this is a testament to how good of quality it is. I could dance and move without feeling like the dress was falling off of me. It was also easy to move around it. At the end of the night I felt sad taking the dress off. I would definitely rent it again.","March 27, 2019","True to Size"

It was a little roomier in the top, but besides that was perfect for me I didn't have to adjust it throughout the night, and when I danced it stayed put. Also, no need for a clutch because it has two large pockets that don't add extra bulk to your figure. Great for short girls as it hits like a long dress in the back, but still shows off your shoes in the front. This is a show stopper. I've never felt so happy in a dress and I've never gotten so many compliments. So flattering, I would rent this again.","March 12, 2019","Formal Affair"

I loved the pockets so I could keep my phone in there, which I used as a camera during the whole event. I wore the 8 but it was snug in the torso. I have a 35"" chest/torso if that helps anyone out. The zipper head was so small and the fabric thick so it was tough to get the zipper up, but once I did it fit. I didn't have a size 10 as a backup but I think that would have been too big, but wish I chose that as a backup so I could have seen. Therefore, I would say this dress runs small as I am normally a 6 or 8 in a dress. Hopefully this helps you all out!","March 9, 2019","Formal Affair"
