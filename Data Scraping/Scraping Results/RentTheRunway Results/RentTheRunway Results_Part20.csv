"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HTC76","Keri","Make this a summer wardrobe staple!","I've rented this a few times and I wear it for work, for fun social nights, and just recently wore it to a luau in Hawaii. It's one of my fave warm weather rentals. It's a gorgeous dress that has great material (not stretchy/clingy) but is light weight. I've lost about 10 pounds since I last rented it and the same size works because it's a wrap. The only potential con: the wrap part is a string, so if you want to tie the dress tight, it can be a bit uncomfortable. I'll keep renting this again!","February 20, 2020","Vacation"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HTC76","RTR Customer","Beautiful dress!","This dress was absolutely amazing! The flow was so fun and I got so many compliments. I recently had a baby and am below my pre pregnancy weight yet nothing fits. I ordered this in my pre pregnancy size and actually needed to go down a size! The bust was large, despite my large chest size. I tried to safety pin it shut but ultimately just put a cami on underneath so I would stop messing with it. The wrap was so great for my body shape and was not as hard to tie as many have said. The trick is there's a hole for the string on the right side of the dress. Would definitely rent this style/brand again!","September 15, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HTC76","Kristin","Wrap dresses are always flattering but this one is better","I love the bright colors and style. The dress is flowy but still structured with quality fabric. The sleeves are probably my favorite part. They have a lot of movement and bounce. I did end up pinning this because it was a bit too low cut for work.","September 13, 2019","Work"

There were not pleats. That's ok. I think it's better without them! The dress runs large. I had a tough time getting it as fitted as I wanted. Good thing it's flowy. The bust was also tricky. I wore this to work and felt like I was exposing myself all day. Later that night I switched undergarments and embraced it and it felt better. I love that I could wear two inch heels with this and not have it hit the ground. Order this and enjoy. It's beautiful.","June 24, 2019","Formal Affair"

It was also super comfortable and all I had to do was wear a camisole and pin the dress closed to make it modest. The only thing is that trying to tie it shut was a nightmare. It made no sense and I ended up probably doing it wrong with the help of a few safety pins. This dress would be ideal if I could take it to a tailor to make the wrap more user-friendly.","October 3, 2019","True to Size"

It is super low cut, so I had to wear a camisole underneath. If you choose to go without, you might want to use fashion tape. The dress was also a bit too long for me in the back.

It’s so fun, and the compliments came rolling in all evening - on the street, at the event, from all the people I texted pictures to so they could see how kicka** my outfit was. Wore with the Samantha Sipos ribbed biker jacket in raisin. (Also available from Unlimited.) In retrospect, I probably would have gotten the skirt in a small as it wouldn't have been quite so snug around my waist. Definitely the kind of piece you want to rent and not own, b/c it is super memorable.","November 23, 2019","Party"

However, I'll say that it fit me perfectly at the waist, which makes me think it runs small. I am slender and xs items are often a bit loose on me, but this was just right.

I chose the size 20, which is typically what I would wear because I have a larger midline. The top was slightly loose but a very good trade off for such comfort in the waist.

As you can see in all of the reviews, the neoprene fabric makes curves look killer. I felt like a million dollars and looked like even more than that. It's low cut on top and high-slitted on the bottom BUT not so high-slitted that you can't get away with Spanx. Not that you need them...The neoprene is smoothing and supportive.

As a top heavy woman, I did not have to wear a bra with this dress... it fit perfectly. My only advice is to wait a while after you shower before putting it on... Even if you dry yourself pretty well, your skin still holds moisture and makes it a bit difficult for the dress to slide on. Besides that, I recommend this dress fully & wholeheartedly!","September 24, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM599","RTR Customer","This dress was absolutely FABULOUS! My only complaint is the dress arrived VERY WRINKLED!","I rented this for a black tie optional wedding and it was so comfortable and beautiful; the BEST of both worlds in my dress dreams. I would say this dress runs on the large size. I am an hourglass shape-ish, smaller on the top now since breast feeding. I usually wear a size 4 if the dress is not form fitting on the bottom (ex. empire waist), or size 6 if I need to accommodate my hips and bum. Although this dress is clearly form fitting, it just runs large and the 4L ended up being the perfect fit for me. I read in advance that some people did not prefer the thicker/stretchy, almost foam-like fabric, but I LOVED it!! The fabric was thick enough to hide any small lump/bums, forgiving enough to allow me to chow down on the the delicious meal and cake that was served without feeling constricted, and comfy enough to be able to bust a move on the dance floor. I am also generally cold nature, so it kept me the perfect temp for this indoor wedding! I got so many compliments on this dress, but my favorite of all was that I looked like a real-life stunning version of the red-dress dancing emoji woman, ha! 💃🏻 Again, my only COMPLAINT about this dress is that arrived so wrinkled; this was a BIG disappointment because not only do I feel like this is not acceptable for this type of service where the dress should arrive dry-cleaned and pressed, but I truly hate ironing. This completely ruined the convenience factor for me by adding a time consuming chore to my ""to-do"" list. I believe RTR should take more care in how they ship certain fabrics;I am hoping this was a result of the shipping process and not how it left the warehouse, but either way the responsibility lies with RTR to package appropriately and prevent these types of issues. Since convenience is key for me, I must admit I am slightly hesitant about the condition of any future arrivals and giving the overall experience 4/5 and the dress 5/5!","September 16, 2019","Large"

It wasn’t too short, and although it was very fitted it was flattering. My only issue was that the quality control on the dress was not good. It came to me with two very noticeable holes (one of the sleeve and one at the back of the neck). which I had to quickly stitch up before our event because my husband immediately noticed and said no way I could wear the dress that way. The material on the neck and sleeves is delicate so I can see how it would snag easily, but the dress should have been checked and fixed before it went out.","February 3, 2020","True to Size"

I'm 5'5"" and the dress came down to the bottom of my calf. A few other reviewers noted pockets with brown buttons at the sides.

When receiving the dress, it smelled of self tanner....bad. I had to febreeze and place in the dryer. The dress itself is itchy to sit in. If you have wide hips, the under layer fits tightly and does not give you much wiggle room. The pockets on the lace part of the dress are attached to the inner layer, giving your hips a little extra(unneeded in my case) volume. Bottom line, Would I rent it again.....yaaaaaassssss, it has pockets! I had a ton of fun dancing in this dress.","July 19, 2018","Wedding"

I chose the size 10R which fit great and just a bit snug in the chest area - which turned out to be perfect because I'm busty and needed to make sure everything was going to stay put! I wore the dress for the ceremony then to the reception and received nothing but compliments all night - and after when friends and family saw the photos! Even the lovely associate at the Rent the Runway store applauded the choice of dress - high praise! The material was light and perfect for a warm sunny day, the color was the perfect true shade of red, it was very comfortable - much needed for a full night of dancing, AND it has pockets.

Also the cutout details is pretty, the zipper works fine, and it was nice and fitted in the waist and not too loose. Would recommend this dress 10/10. My only issue was siting in it for a while, your legs are on the lace, due to a shorter lining, and sitting on it became slightly uncomfortable.","July 8, 2018","Wedding"

The one shoulder and cut outs on the front and back of the dress give the dress a sexier look than expected but still keeps it classy. I vary between a size 8 and 10 because of my hips but the 10R seemed to fit me best in this style. I would definitely recommend sizing up for backup as the fabric does not have much give in the bust area however, the full skirt allows for a lot of room once past the waist. Paired with a cute pair of open toe heels, this dress is perfect for a daytime or even evening event!","April 26, 2018","Small"

For some reason the photos make the dress appear to be a heavier fabric/material, but in person it's much more lightweight - it's a super finely pleated silk with a subtle but intricate pattern on it. The ""waistline"" does hit high on your torso (more like rib cage) and with no give, so I recommend sizing up. I got constant compliments and felt like a million bucks in this piece. It was comfortable enough to wear all day and into the evening; i was sad to take it off! Yigael Azrouel knows how to design a dress for a woman's body.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YA111","RTR Customer","Beautiful unique dress!","I really liked this dress! Like others mentioned, it was very hard to zip it down and up because of how thick the middle details are. I had to use pliers as well. I'm not that tall so I ended up using hemming tape to shorten the dress, which worked our nicely since the material is so light. This would be harder to do with a thicker dress or with a different silhouette dress. I could've left the length alone and it would've came to about my ankles but I thought it looked better midi length. I wore this to a wedding at an elegant venue so the dress fit the location well. The top part is pretty tight so I wouldn't recommend for big busted ladies. I'm an A to B cup and I didn't wear bra or petals. The bottom is pretty loose and comfortable.","February 13, 2018","Small"

The reason I am giving this dress 4 instead of 5 stars is that it was impossible to zip by myself! The zipper got very stuck at the waistband, & it was even difficult for another person to zip.

Once you are in it though so WORTH IT!","October 3, 2017","True to Size"

The color was fabulous, the material is actually extremely light and thin. The dress moves great and fit true to size. Had I had no need to wear a bra as I am small chested but you could wear one just know that there are some slightly see through elements to the decorative trim so select appropriately. Would totally recommend this dress!","September 25, 2017","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YA111","Kaitlyn","Not perfect but still gorgeous","Minimal difference between sizes 2&4 in terms of the bodice. I went with the 2 because it was slightly shorter. I am 5'5 and length was a little long, closer to ankle length than midi as on the model. The zipper is very difficult to get past the thicker fabric accents on the midsection. All in all a gorgeous dress and I got compliments all evening.","September 10, 2017","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YA111","Cynthia","Formal wedding.","When this dress arrive I have to admit, I was very disappointed. I thought the fabric was a bit more vibrant and formal. (In the inventory image, it almost looks like it has sequins although that isn't stated in the description.) The colors are actually a bit flat with a taupe color in the pattern that I did not anticipate by the image. When I tried it on I knew I had the right chhoice for me rather than going with the typical LBD. As far as the fit, the banding was very snug around my rib cage, even in the size 6, which is some thing to consider... The angles in the bodice along with that black band gives the dress this fun artsy look. And little sassy surprise was that the black & white bands are see through! The length is pretty long even for my height and I think what makes this design so pretty is that it should brush the ankles. I went with a little higher heel than initially intended to lift the hem line away from the floor more. Overall, it was a huge hit and I felt great all night.","July 21, 2017","Small"

I'm 5'3"" and could probably used a petite size as the waist to shoulder ratio was a bit big for my frame. But all in all I loved wearing this beautiful dress.","June 25, 2017","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YA111","RTR Customer","The bottom half of the dress is loose which made it great for dancing.","This dress was stunning!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YA111","Erica","Comfy, light and unique.","So, I did not originally rent this dress. RTR ended up not having the size I needed in my previously rented dress so I chose this as an alternative. I am generally a size 6 and probably could have worn the 6 in this dress but only had the 8 as an option. It ended up being around 90 degrees the day of this wedding so this lighter flowy option was best! I received a ton of compliments on it because it was so unique. I have a smaller bust (32b) and the top fit me perfectly and I am 5'7 and the length was just right. If you were any shorter I think this dress would be too long on you if you are hoping to get the midi look. All in all, positive experience with a dress that I didn't really want but ended up wearing!","May 22, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YA111","Amanda","RTR Team Review","Beautiful dress! One of my favorites. Running true to size, I'd recommend sizing up for backup. There is some stretch to the fabric in the hip/waist area, but the bust has little to no stretch. If you're bustier, I'd recommend sizing up because the bust area is cut on the smaller side. The waist is also more fitted, but gives the illusion of curves. Love the print, perfect for a cocktail party or wedding. Best worn without a bra or with a nubra. Pair with black heels.","May 16, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YA111","Rachel","Fun and fancy choice for Gala","I rented this for my fiancés business school gala- the top is fitted and the bottom is cut straight, so even with a curvier bottom half I didn't have to worry about the style being or looking tight.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YA111","J","Beautiful green dress","This yigal dress is beautiful and the color is very rich. The fabric is light and for my height at 5'4"" it is just right above my ankle. I had a very hard time zipping where the middle embroidery was but once it is on it is very comfortable with a lot of room in the hips. The only thing is that it is quite tight at the bust area. At 34D I felt squished (but then again I was wearing a bra) but it was just right exact at my waist (25). I think that it would work better for A-C cups (with bra) or if higher cups then go bra less. Overall, this dress is beautiful! Perfect for a spring weather!","March 25, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YA111","Christin","RTR STYLIST REVIEW","I absolutely loved this dress! The pattern matched with the tiny pleats was beautiful and the tasteful cutouts at the top made this still feel like a youthful style despite the length. I would definitely recommend that anyone considering renting this piece size up, however. My measurements are H: 34, W:24 B: 34 and this was comfortable at my waist, tight at my bust and there was no stretch in the top of the dress.. If I were to rent this again, I would probably do the size 2 rather than the 0. Also, at 5'5"" this came to my ankles, so for more petite women this could easily become a floor length style. I wore this with black ankle boots, but as the weather warms up this would look beautiful with a nude or black strappy sandal and simple jewelry.","March 24, 2017","Small"

I could fit into the 10, but it was pretty snug on waist, so I went up a size to a 12 and that was also pretty fitted. By going up a size, the sleeves were a bit too long and the length was very long as well, which made it drag on the floor and cause people to step on it. :-/ Other than that a very unique and elegant dress with a nice conservative touch. I'm 5'5"" and am very curvy, so I also appreciated that the dress was able to minimize the curves that I didn't want to highlight. Overall, very happy.","April 16, 2019","Formal Affair"

I am in the middle of a size 8 and 10 in dresses, and ordered the 10, which was a little too big. The waist didn't quite fit snuggly. However, I think the eight might have gapped at the chest. The fabric is great, but weighty and pulls the dress down. As a result, the waist hung lower than it should and the dress felt a bit heavy. I'm 5'9 and it hit the floor barefoot, which is awesome for tall ladies! My daughter's (male) dentist complimented the dress as ""lovely"" but hubby thought it was just ok (as you can see from his comment above!).

Also, I have a petite frame and sometimes between a 4 and a 6, but the chest buttons up tight, so size up if you are between sizes.

I would recommend sizing up if you have a large bust. My only choice was a 6 or a 10 as I used my Unlimited, but I think the 8 may have fit a little less snug in the bust. There is zero stretch to the material, but it zips in the back so I was able to fit my bust in and zip it up.","August 29, 2018","Everyday"

The 4R fit great everywhere, except it was pretty long on me (I wore flats but should've worn a 3"" wedge) and the bust was slightly too big on me (not an issue if you avoid bending over). A major plus was the built-in cups, so no bra was necessary!","August 26, 2018","Party"

I am a only 5 ft tall so it ran long on me with 3 inch heels on. However, the fit of the dress was perfect! A little too perfect in the bust area, not much room for any more unless you size up. The fabric is stretchy which makes this dress very comfortable. You don't need to wear a bra with this dress, but if you need to go for a strapless or Nu Bra.","July 3, 2018","True to Size"

The fit through the bust was nice, albeit a little on the large side (I'm a 32C). The material was a beautiful, flowing material with quality weight to it but not overly heavy. When I tried it on, the length and the way it flowed to the ground did not have a stately flow like the model; rather, it looked as if I were playing dress-up!

I am a small 32B, and even I felt like the coverage was minimal. I secured everything with fashion tape to make sure everything stayed in place on the dance floor :) The fabric has a luxurious weight to it and a little stretch—no Spanx needed!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FK24","Jodi","Darts in bust area makes for a really odd look","I loved everything about this dress...in pictures. However when I received it I was sadly disappointed. Pros - beautiful material and detail, cutout in the back was gorgeous. Fun mini skirt length for summer. Was planning on wearing with flat sandals since I am 5'10"". Cons - reviews said to size up. I am normally a 4 on top and 6 on bottom so I ordered a L. The bust area was tight (I'm a 34-36C) and the darts were higher than my boobs so it fit so weird! The bottom in the waist area was gappy because it was too large and the hip area was larger however I would have been ok with that because it made the dress a little longer. I tried this on to wear several times and each time I couldn't get over the odd look the darts gave me from the side and even the front (my nipples looked higher than my girls!) sadly have to send it back :(","July 9, 2019","Party"

Just wear nude undies or something for the inevitable Marylin Monroe moments you'll be having. This fit well, even braless, the material is thick enough to conceal the nips. There is a lining as well that makes the dress lay smooth but traps body heat in the mid section. I'm 5'7"", almost 6ft in the heels and would probably be more appropriate for a shorter person.","July 2, 2019","Date"

Neckline and sleeves with cutouts were a cute addition. Skirt is pretty flared, would have been hesitant to dance/bend over much due to concern for revealing too much. Dress was perfect length for my height, would run the risk of being too short for taller individuals. My chest is on the smaller size and definitely didn't fill out the top of the dress but it still looked good. Backless feature was stunning.","May 22, 2019","Other"

If I were to wear it without a jacket would need a larger size. It came new with the tags on. However, the bric brac on the bottom was unstitched and gaping slightly....I think that is not acceptable on any garment in this situation. I wore this for an all day into evening event. It has a lot of wrinkles in it now. Would have liked to have gotten two wearings, but really needs a good cleaning to address the wrinkles. Also the tightness under arms meant that the under arm area needs cleaning. Still a stunning outfit and many compliments.","April 6, 2019","Work"

The ruffles and cut were perfect to hide those extra pounds and the flowy sleeves gave the dress an extra pop. The other reviews are right about the straps being very loose - we used a safety pin in the back to tighten them up and show less cleavage (I mean, it was a brunch bridal shower...none of my mom's friends want to see that, hah). At 5'9 the maxi length was good, I wore flats and it hit right below my ankle. I got so many compliments and I know it wasn't just because I was the bride.

The color and pattern is SO pretty. The fit, however, is a little odd. I have narrow shoulders, but the straps were too long and kept falling down, and the v is low... I kept having to adjust so you couldn't see the top of my strapless bra. The rest of the dress is overall relatively small - only small steps in this dress!

The print looks like a watercolor, & the fabric moves beautifully as you walk. I wore my highest heels, and taking a tip from another customer, I rolled the fabric at the waist to keep it from dragging on the ground. Strangely enough, it was slightly large on me as well. If I rent this again, I think the 2 would work better for me. If it fits better, I might not need to roll the waist to keep it from dragging.","June 20, 2018","Everyday"

The straps were aaaalmost too long, but I think the larger bust took up the excess, didn't need to pin, one shoulder slid off only when sitting. The draping is super flattering without looking like you're trying to hide bulges! The bottom was pretty slim, so don't expect to take long strides, but it didn't interfere with anything. The back went down low enough to show off neck and shoulders, but still high enough to wear a strapless body suit. Wore coral strappy wedges from WHBM, got so many complements.

I am only 5""3, so I think if you were a couple inches taller you wouldn't have that problem. Also, because of my height, you couldn't really see the asymmetrical detail and the right side did touch the ground, but not too big of a deal, if there had been petite sizes, it would have been perfect.

It was a coworker's wedding where my entire office was attending, so I needed it to be modest enough to wear in front of everyone, but breezy enough that I could wear it in the Florida heat outside. I absolutely love the off the shoulder style but I can never get away with it because as a 32F, I always need to wear a bra. This dress let me fulfill my dreams!!!!! It was 100% supportive and the frill on top covered up any nippy peeks! The dress is a beautiful denim blue with white eyelets. It does have a slit that goes up to that last seam. That fell about low to mid thigh for me (5 foot 4). There's a zipper up the left side. The dress stays up well even through all the dancing! I don't think I ever adjusted it!

The cinnamon color/fabric for the sleeves is exquisite, but the body of the dress (fabric) is just OK.

Once it was on and all the smoothing was done underneath, it turned out great. But in order to wear this, you need to be comfortable with a true bodycon dress.

If you're worried about your upper arms (as I am), this is the dress for you, girl. I felt so beautiful in this! At 5'4, it hits at the mid thigh, making it a really nice option for dress codes ranging from cocktail to creative black tie.

I would have bought it, except that it's memorable and I just don't go to enough parties. I rented a medium. As other reviewers mentioned, it's a little tight in the waist (and I've got a large waist) but the material is thick and stretchy. The end result is that it holds you in without spanx, and you do have some room in the middle. The lace is memorable and even more beautiful than in the photo, and the color is a bright red with an almost orange undertone. I'm petite and this dress has a long torso, but the material accommodated me without much trouble. It's stunning! If you're on the fence, just rent it. I wore it for a work party with thousands of people, and got compliments all night on the dress (including from several random men at bars we went to afterwards, who specifically commented on my dress...maybe not a desirable result but hey) One woman even commented on the fit, saying it looked like it had been 'made for me'.

After selecting & returning almost 6 dresses, this was it! It's sophisticated but not plain-Jane boring. The slit made me feel sexy w/o being too revealing. The shoulder & hip detail were interesting w/o being flashy. The best was the material-it was stretchy & comfy that hug things in :) this pic was the initial try on & it doesn't do it justice. Perfect length w/ heels. Returned w/o wearing due to travel ban but will rent again!","March 21, 2020","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BH68","Victoria","The dress was flattering and sexy without being revealing","I loved the fabric on this one. It was decently thick, which means it didn't cling too tightly in the belly area, which can be a struggle. It was really flattering without being revealing, which I appreciated because I wore it to a family wedding. You could wear the straps further up on your shoulders or down like I did, they both worked well. At 5'9, I'm definitely glad I got the long size - the regular was too short even with flats.","March 5, 2020","True to Size"

I love the material; it was thick and snug for a winter formal event, yet it could also be worn in warmer weather. The arm straps fit perfectly and did not slide down. The dress offered the right amount of coverage; I did not feel as though the dress was revealing (I was among my work colleagues, so this was a plus!). The color is bold and beautiful. I had great appreciation for the minimal effort I needed to put into accessorizing the dress (hair, makeup, jewelry, etc.) because it spoke for itself. This dress was timeless and classy.

The slit in front is a nice touch and it wasn't too high for me. I was worried the straps would be annoying or too tight but they laid on my perfectly and it was comfortable to dance in all night. This dress really fit me like a glove. The side peplum hides the right area for me and the fabric is a thicker material but very stretchy. I'm sometimes in between sizes and the smaller size fit me so I'd say this dress runs a tiny bit on the larger side.

Yet, I still really liked it. When I put it on, my 8-year-old told me I looked like a ""fashionable witch."" HA! I wore to work and got compliments from co-workers and a perfect stranger at lunch. The sleeves are major statements. They are not too long, and the material is very heavy so the sleeves don't flop. They also have large metal grommets that add to the drama. This is not a dress for the faint-hearted. The material is very thick, making the dress somewhat heavy--it is definitely not a warm-weather dress. When I say heavy, it wasn't districting--more that the material had a presence. It had some stretch to it and was form-fitting, but didn't feel too sexy because of the boat collar, length (past my knee) and longer sleeves. It was comfortable to wear and not constrictive at all. The only ""con"" is that the sleeves would NOT fit in any coat I had. You would HAVE to wear a cape. Also, not sure how breathable the fabric is. I sweat very little and usually have no odor issues, but my underarms were a little scented at the end of the day. Luckily, the heavy fabric also kept the scent in. ;)","February 23, 2019","Work"

Highly recommend it!","January 28, 2020","Party"

It was beautiful. I was between sizes (10 and 12), but I'm glad I went with the 12 because I think the 10 would have inhibited my movement. I got a lot of compliments on this look, and there weren't too many people disappointed that I opted for a green wedding dress instead of a white one, which I think I owe in part to this green dress being so special.","January 21, 2020","True to Size"

My only complaint is that the skirt was pretty wrinkled when I received it, and, because the fabric is pretty heavy, I wasn't able to get the wrinkles out before I needed to wear it. That was a minor issue though, and I'm overall really pleased with this dress.

The skirt seems shorter than it is since it flares out but it was definitely long enough to pass the fingertip test on me and I'm 5'5"". I was comfortable standing and sitting, but I wore spandex shorts underneath for extra coverage in case I needed it. My only negative comment about this dress is that the arm pit area dug in a bit and after a 12-hour long day of wearing it, my pits were a little red, mildly irritated and uncomfortable. Next day they were fine though, so it wasn't an issue. I wish I could own a Herve Leger dress *daydreamy sigh*","September 20, 2016","Work"

I didn't end up wearing it because I decided to wear another dress that I loved equally, but would 100% rent again for another Black Tie Optional / Black Tie wedding. The only somewhat-con is that since the inside paneling is nude, it really does look like it's sheer/there's nothing underneath, so it came off as maybe borderline too sexy.","February 13, 2020","True to Size"

Fell open around legs when seated at bar, which wasn't an issue for me but might bother some (could be held, tucked, or pinned easily). Chose this picture because it best represents how the dress felt a little bit like I was wearing a robe...which happened to be super comfy but could feel frumpy to some, I suppose.

This dress has no stretch and has a lining. Over my lifetime of shopping and having this same body shape (no matter what my weight) I know what that means...go up in size and I still may not be able to get it over my hips. The dress angels were working in my favor with this one...got over my hips and wasn't too large at the top (which is generally the case).

I wore two-inch heels with it and the hem still hit the floor (which I didn't want - I would've preferred a little more clearance, especially since I wore this dress to an event on a snowy night), and the v-neck came much lower down than I expected based on the picture.

Luckily it still draped nicely and I was able to pin the straps in the back a bit to bring the very low v-neck plunge up to an acceptable length. The slit in actually in front, though in the picture it looks on the side. It is sexy but still flattering. The glitter.....GETS EVERYWHERE. Be prepared.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PR105","Lisa e","Stretchy but small - difficult zipper is easier if you size up","Update to below: the size 4 fits fine although that zipper is still a challenge to get up and down - it's always a problem imo when a zipper goes past a waistband esp a stretchy one like this. There's tons of stretch so other than the finicky zipper it's pretty flexible. The chest is a little wide so I'd try the 2 as well but it wasn't available this time. Wore with a regular nude bra and the strap tended to show on one side in the front because the dress was a little loose. My first review (about the size 0) This is a lovely dress but it fit a little too small so I sent it back without wearing - the waist is stretchy, but it has a side zipper that I had trouble with, I could not get zipped at least partially because of how tight the dress was but also possibly because the zipper stuck (I had a hard time unzipping it when the dress wasn't even on). It also wasn’t as ideal for my weekend plans as I’d hoped, a little too peasant hippie for what I wanted, and the fabric was very lightweight for the season, but I’ll definitely try it again in the spring a size up. There are so many beautiful details in this dress, I will have a better idea of how to style it having tried it on.","January 23, 2019","Small"

I received so many compliments on this dress! It fits very true to size. I’m tall (6’) so I really liked how the length hit me right below the knee. For most women, I would imagine it would hit a few inches below the knee. The arm pieces weren’t at all constricting, and the dress itself was fairly comfortable. It’s a structured dress, so it’s very flattering, even in white. You can wear a strapless bra, but I opted to go without and use nipple covers (you can see through without them). The straps are adjustable, so it will fit women with varying bust sizes, but I wouldn’t rent this dress if you are very busty. Overall, I love this dress! One of my favorites I’ve rented!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN154","Kimberly","Compliments galore!","I rented this for a company holiday party for clients, but it didn't arrive early enough. It would have been festive for the party but I wore it to work (law firm) later in the week and it was a hit. I didn't feel like it was too glitzy for day to evening. The shirt was well constructed and light. The fit was true pencil skirt. I have a 35 inch inseam and the length was just a hair above the knee-- work appropriate. I got so so many compliments. I think it's best worn with a tucked in or cropped top so the design and embellishment at the top of the skirt shows.","December 6, 2017","Party"

I rented an 8 because I have a big butt & hips so my normal size 6 usually doesn't fit. I would have been ok with a 6 on this so it runs true to size.

It fit well and was conservative but still really interesting. The one small complaint was that the material caught at the back slit part and needed some manual adjusting but only after pulling the skirt up and down. Overall amazing!","October 31, 2017","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN154","Kate","Unique and beautiful pencil skirt","The embroidery and detail on this skirt is to die for. I got a lot of compliments. The stitching and small sequin details are not itchy, nor are they over-the-top. I wish I had a better top to pair with it! I felt like it ran a bit large - I'm usually a 2 and though that size fit, I like my skirts to be a bit tighter and higher-waisted. I paired it with black heels (not for the photo) and was glad for lift because at 5'6"", the skirt was slightly below my knees. Would rent again and try a 0 and pair it with a more fashion-forward top!","October 30, 2017","Work"

The cute just didn't work for me. Usually, pencil skirts look killer on me but this one hugged my hips at a funny spot and gave me a dreaded pouch. Even with shapewear, it didn't sit just right.

It is longer than the style I was wanting so I folded some of the dress under at the waist to make it shorter, therefore it looked like there was a tie around the dress at the waist.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NAN2","Carole","Elegant and flattering - wore with sleek pants and a trench","Thought this might work well for professional dinners and yet I scarcely had a chance to wear it on business trip to Portugal. Luckily, I wore it several times during my mom's visit to my hometown of San Francisco. It is a great piece for a night out on the town in cool spring weather and is best layered with a trench on top if needed -- so you won't look too bulky. I wore it to the theater with my mom and to meet up with friends for drinks. The color is subtle yet eye-catching while the cut is elegant and flattering. I wore with sleek black pants underneath as I think it would be a bit too revealing and uncomfortably short for us taller, curvier gals. It does beautifully accentuate an hourglass figure, which is a plus. Also, as noted by others, a safety pin may be needed to reinforce the closure.","May 6, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NAN2","Hilary","Obsessed","This Nanushka dress is a BEAUT. I'm a fan of the brand from afar and was so excited to see a few items added to RTR. I snatched this one up and it arrived new with tags. It's a dreamy, silky, beautiful blue pseudo-wrap dress, that has two snaps in the front to hold it together and then a tie on the side that lets you adjust how tight the waist is. I got so many compliments on this dress and wore it twice: once to a cocktail-attire awards gala and once to work drinks and dinner at a conference. The length of the skirt makes it work appropriate, but double sided tape would be useful to hold the top together. It can droop while you sit, which you have to be mindful of. Overall fit true to size.","March 8, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NAN2","Rene","Gorgeous but beware of those snaps","I loved this dress BUT it is a wrap dress secured with two snap closures. The snap nearest the tie tends to pop open when sitting, breathing, walking or talking. So unless you're a mannequin, beware that you will probably be fixing that snap all day. You will also want to tape or pin the front to avoid too much chest on display. Regardless, I love the chic factor and felt amazing in it. At some point I gave up on that damn snap and just enjoyed being in a beautiful feeling garment. I would recommend it for a date (it makes an amazing end of night reveal). And not for 8 hours in the office.","March 8, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NAN2","Annaliese","Yeap, it looks like a bathrobe","I ordered this for a fancy night out, but it looked just like a bathrobe on me. Two tiny snaps hold it together around the waist, before you tie the side knot. The inside snap was a tad too tight for my waist and would stay shut, but I would still categorize this dress as TTS. Cuffs are oversized/loose.","March 7, 2019","Date"

Usually I am a 4 in most everything, but I always get a 6 to be on the safe side. (I have wider hips/butt). I really wanted to like jumpsuit, however, the fit in my opinion was totally off. If you have small bust, and any kind of hips/thighs this suit is not going to work for you. This is best for girls without hips. The 4 on me pulled at my hips and the top fit better, but still was not holding me in well. The 6 fit better in the hips, but the top was so large. Those with a larger bust may do well in this as they can fill it out better.

The length is a bit shorter in the front and longer in the back which was super pretty. At 5'2, the longest part of the dress (in the back) hit me at my ankles.

It works for all cup sizes. You are able to wear a standard bra with this dress. At 5'3, the length hit tea length on me. Pair with some black heels and you're set!","May 24, 2018","True to Size"

I had to hold it a lot, which I didn't like. I wish there was some kind of hook (sort of like what they do the the chest area on low cut tops) to prevent this, as it made me self conscious any time I had to get up to walk somewhere. Which is ironic, because if you have good legs you want to wear this dress and show them off - but I didn't want to show off 'other areas'!","June 6, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AX106","Lani","Fun to wear out.","At 5'3"", the sleeves are more like long 3/4 sleeves and the length is to my ankles. I just rolled up the sleeves for a more casual look and it was fine. XS / 0 sizes tend to be a bit large for me (by length and width), so the fact that this fit me probably indicates that the dress is smaller than a typical XS / 0. I have broad shoulders so it was a little tight around the shoulders, but I'm a 30A, so the lack of boobage prevented the dress from feeling too tight.","June 4, 2019","Small"

I ordered the smallest available 4R, which equates to a 0 according to the size options. My normal size is 0, so that is why I say it runs true to size, also! The color & fit are beautiful. The material is quite thick, which is a double edged sword. It worked as it's own ""Spanx"" & gave me a great shape, but it was a little warm for the summer wedding (thankfully it was indoor). The high neck and low cut sides make it sexy & sophisticated & a perfect style for a formal Summer wedding. One thing to note, I could not wear a bra with it because the sides are so low. I used chicken cutlets (not pictured in my image) to give a little more fullness, but I had to position them really close so they wouldn't stick out on the side. I would recommend pasties if you are worried about nipples showing. Also, I thought I would be swallowed up in the dress because I am only 5'1"", 115lbs and there seemed to be a lot of material, but it fit me perfectly! Would recommend!","June 26, 2019","Wedding"

Running true to size, I recommend your usual size as your primary and going one size up for a backup size. This dress is comfortable throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips, however it still felt comfortable/had some stretch. It works best for A-C cup sizes, as this dress is fitted at the bust. This style should be worn with a strapless bra. The cut of the dress is asymmetrical and hits just below the knee. I absolutely love the style of this dress, it is super flattering and fun! I would definitely pair it with nude heels (as pictured), a pretty, yet delicate pair of earrings and a statement handbag.","January 11, 2019","True to Size"

There are no zippers, so you have to pull it over your head, but the stretch in the dress makes it comfortable. I consider myself a bit ""busty"" and the dress amplifies your boobs quite a bit.

Per usual, this brand did not disappoint in the areas of quality, construction and design and the scuba material does a great job of hiding ones flaws. Also, per usual for this brand- no zippers so you MUST STEP INTO THE DRESS AND PULL IT UP. Zero chance -unless you're a contortionist- anyone could get this on pulling it over their head.

But I couldn't wear the small because I am 5'6"" and needed the longer jumpsuit because the regular was too short. I ordered two replacements that came in time but were too big for me to wear, so I decided to squeeze my tummy into the XSL and although breathing was a lil rough, this was so comfy and it stayed up so well and I loved how it flowed. My boyfriend loves it so much he wants to buy me the Small Long size! 10/10. This was my first RTR and it could not have gone any better, I am so sold.

I'm about 5 6 1/2 and I can wear a lower heal - it's not long enough for my 3 inch or higher shoes .

If you have a larger chest, probably not the dress for you or size way up. Dress is super flattering and worth it. It makes my waist look teeny.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JW67","Deana","Perfect Dress for a Summer Outdoor Wedding… Compliments Galore!","I ended up wearing the 12R. I’m regularly between sizes 8 and 10 – however, this dress fit extra snug in the ribcage area – leaving the 12R sort of tight too. The dress is comfortable, flowing, hits just below the knee and it has pockets – love pockets on dresses. The one shoulder was the icing on the cake, making the dress every bit elegant. The dress is black and if you see blue in this dress, it’s only in some of the flower patterns. I opted out on wearing a bra, wanted the upper portion of the dress to be as loose as I could get it. Lastly, I’m still not a fan on the side zipper and definitely not with this dress, needed help zipping it up. Loved this dress, even though it was slightly tight in the mid-section. Extremely comfortable, cotton material, flowing and perfect all around.","June 10, 2019","Small"

The dress runs small and honestly might look a little dumpy if you have any curves. All the frills and fabric were a little too busy on my 5'4 frame, but if you happen to be tall and skinny like the model in the picture it would probably look really cute!!","June 9, 2019","Small"

The fabric was lighter than I expected, and it has pockets. Generally, the shape was flattering, but the neckline did not work for me. Though it fit perfectly everywhere else, I struggled to get it zipped over my chest. I am not that busty (36C). Once zipped, my chest was bulging out over the strapless side. Not flattering. I think this might be lovely on someone with a smaller chest.","June 8, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JW67","Kristin","Size up. Fabric more casual than I anticipated.","Love love love the lines of this dress but wasn't able to wear as i couldn't get it to zip around my ribs (I have a broad chest and shoulders). I'm usually closer to a 4 in dresses, and was taking a chance with the 2, especially since the fabric has no give. Based on the unzippable gap, I'm guessing I have to go up to a 6. If you're on the fence, size up. Also note, the pattern and lines are beautiful, but the fabric seems like a cotton and is more casual than I expected. Light and airy though. Arrived with some wrinkles than would easily steam out, but I would be worried that it would wrinkle pretty easily with wear. Still might try again in a larger size on this one.","June 5, 2019","Wedding"

Nowadays, though, instead of the polyester flash of the 70s, jumpsuits are made with sophistication in mind. The navy blue was a lovely flattering tone and with the belt cinched, the jumpsuit hugged all the right places. I am considerably shorter than the model, so the outfit came down to right above my ankles (the model has the jumpsuit stopping right below her knees), but paired with my white mules, the length was totally fine. The front does open a bit and left me wishing I had pinned it since fashion tape didn't last long.

The top of the dress is really interesting and elevates the whole look. The fabric feels light but is surprisingly heavy enough to keep the bottom from flying up in the wind. Note the top is a smaller fit, it worked for me, but I am a 30 A and didn't wear a bra. Also worth noting that the sleeves are pretty restricting, not uncomfortable but if you are planning on dancing it could be annoying.","July 10, 2019","Party"

Background of dress is black and flowers are slightly muted- not vibrant which was perfect. DEFINITELY size UPPP for your back-up. Ive always worn a zero and this zero was super tight (it would have been inappropriate to wear). The 2 fit wonderfully but was tight in shoulders...i by NO means have broad shoulders- but i was the only one who could tell it was tight in that area. If you have a bigger chest this dress definitely wont work. Although there was an issue with shipping- RTR overnighted me the same dress and same back up size as my original order and it arrived 11 am next day. Only complaint with this order is the shipping- when i placed the original order the app defaulted to my old address and im told there is no way to remove previous shipping addresses feom the system- so be mindful of this.

I like the print and the overall design, but at 5'6"", the dress was about 4"" longer than I like. The fabric doesn't have give either so this will shorten your stride when you walk. Heed the advice of others with sizing - the sleeves and chest are cut very small, and the 4 was snug on me (I'm usually a 2). The lower abdomen / butt area was about 1"" too big though so the fabric bunched up there a little. I'm glad I rented this dress but I wouldn't rent it a second time.","December 10, 2017","Work"

I wore this to an event where I mostly sat and by the end of the day, I was happy that I didn't own it.

It's a pretty heavy eyelet fabric and it is sufficiently lined, so even on a windy day I wasn't worried about any unintentional displays. I think this dress really needs a belt though! It doesn't hit at the slimmest point for me (the skirt seam is at my ribcage, not my natural waist), so a belt helped add some definition. Because it is a thicker fabric, that seam in particular is a little thick and adds some bulk. But with a belt it's perfect! There's a little room in the bust for me (32A) but it isn't unflattering. I do think the fabric can be a little uncomfortable against the armpits/upper arms, though. But it does look pretty.

The side cutouts were a little bigger than I expected, but sexy without being over the top. I loved pairing it with a leather jacket.

The next time I tried it on, it seemed to fit a little better--and through the night, the legs almost became too loose. So I'd say it stretches with wear. For pant length, I would've preferred a petite, but I was surprised the regular just barely fit my short torso--a petite might have been to short in the torso!

The cutouts make it perfect for a night out and it fits like a dream. I'd say it's true to size, I'm between a 6-8 and the 6 was snug, but it fit. I don't think I'd size up because this piece looks better tight that loose. I hope I can rent it again soon!","February 18, 2019","Vacation"

The fabric was thick, so the legs tucked under and stayed which was perfect because I'm short. The area for the cut outs was a little snug compared to the rest though. Baggier in the butt so the butt/thigh area would have been way, way too big if I sized up to be perfectly comfortable in the abdomen though. It wasn't unbearable so I just went with it. The only other issue is that I had to have a friend come upzip/zip me in the bathroom. Overall, would rent again if the occasion was right.","January 11, 2019","True to Size"

I think if your chest is at all big though it might be too tight. I am pretty petite on top in my chest and waist and it was perfect with no bra. Also, since I am a pear, I found this jumpsuit more forgiving in the hips and butt area - but also extremely flattering. The length was also fine. It was not a cropped leg on me (like it is on the model) but the length was fine.

Since the dress was not tight I wore a spandex underneath to keep things in place and create form. Because of the open back, you can't wear a bra either so beware if you are busty.

Very (!) long belt with buckle that I ended up knotting which I thought looked nice. I wore it this plats to be more comfortable but would look awesome with pumps.

The heavy ponte cloth was very supportive and flattering in the skirt and held its shape well at the 60-s inspired asymmetrical neckline. It's an elevated LBD - the neckline can be pulled low off one shoulder, or rest higher for an Audrey Hepburn feel - and the asymmetric short/er sleeves are fun and fashionable - it's a sophisticated but fun look that makes the dress have statement. Love it. Went online and bought one as soon as i got home!","November 27, 2019","Party"

What appeared to be off-the-shoulder, loose dolman style top on the model ended up being just a boatneck, t-shirt cut on me. I have broad shoulders, 36DD chest and narrow hips for reference. Ordered a L and XL which fit about the same. Skirt was form-fitting which I would have loved if the top was loose and off the shoulder, but combo of t-shirt top and mini skirt was not a good look.","November 1, 2019","Formal Affair"

The fabric is thick, stretchy and very forgiving and felt very comfortable. I typically wear a regular size 12 or 14 in dresses but I wore a 3x because I wanted a good folder over by the waist seam and I didn't want to be pulling on the dress all night. It was the perfect fit. I think if you are well endowed at the top as I am, you want to go up a couple of sizes. The fit was snug on my hips but I did not have to keep pulling it down so that was good. I highly recommend sizing up depending on the look you are going for. I did an 8 day rental to make sure I had enough time to try it on and I am glad I did because my initial order was for the 1x and 2x and I had to re order the 3x that RTR sent over night thankfully! So it worked out very well. Oh and the icing on the cake... because I was a 1st time renter I got an additional free rental and I chose the super cute purse you see in the picture by Rebecca Minkoff! I got so many compliments and I felt so pretty!! Major win for RTR!! I will be back!","May 20, 2019","Small"

The dress had a great stretch. I'm bigger on the bottom. Hips are 47"". Waist 36"". So the bottom fit more snugly. Normally I go for garments that skim my body, nothing too tight. This was a bit tight. I don't think the material could have stretched much more. But, because it's a high quality material, it didn't ripple or look like it was stretched too far. It was elegant. With shapers it smoothed everything and I didn't mind my hips being the feature of the night. My date really loved the dress and couldn't take his eyes off me. :) Bonus: The top can be styled in different ways. You can wear it off the shoulder or centered on the shoulder. I recommend an OBI belt with a wide front to further accentuate the waist. (Not pictured here.)","February 19, 2019","Date"

I usually wear M/L but opted for the XL for comfort. The larger size did make it a bit longer & top heavy. Still enjoyed the look & comfort! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it had a strong scent, which I'd like to believe it was from being professionally dry cleaned as opposed to the previous persons perfume.","February 14, 2019","Party"

My body is shaped like a pregnant man. I have narrow hips, a very rotund midsection and broad shoulders. Dresses are normally a nightmare because most dresses are cut for women who are shaped like actual women. If you read the reviews of this dress from other people, their biggest complaint is that it is too large on top and too tight on the bottom. Their burden is my blessing. This fit so well. It does not have a zipper, so it slips on. Fortunately the fabric is thick and stretchy. I wore this dress to a ""50s Prom"" themed event in the late fall. Instead of wearing it with one shoulder exposed, I wore it balanced on both shoulders so the neckline was more of a sculptural bateau. Perfect.","November 24, 2018","Large"

Sizing down made the top less crazy voluminous and the bottom was tight but not too bad. The fabric is thick, perfect for an autumn party, but stretchy.

OTOH, like all other things MGSM, there was no give and it was tight and restrictive under my arms (which I'd say are medium-framed. I am not very fine-boned, but overall am petite). Eventually, I just lowered the zipper by an inch to stay comfortable, because YOLO (by that I mean I did that because I was inebriated).

If you're pregnant, I recommend sticking to your normal pre-pregnancy size. If you're not pregnant, order a size down. I'm six months pregnant and it fit nicely all around the belly and hips. The fabric is lightweight and breathable, but not so lightweight that it's see through. I wore this for a luncheon and would consider it even for everyday wear. I read previous reviews and ordered a size down, but it didn't fit my growing bust from being pregnant. I couldn't zip it all the way, even without wearing a bra. I gave it 4 stars versus 5 because the sleeve cuffs were kinda awkward--I could only fit one arm through the off-shoulder sleeve and couldn't figure out how the other arm was supposed to fit draped off the shoulder like it does in the stock photo because it wasn't nearly wide enough to fit over my shoulders (and I'm not broad-shouldered or anything).","October 10, 2017","Large"

Lol. Many reviews mentioned that it ran big, so I ordered the equivalent of a size 6 & 8, when I normally get an 8 & 10. There was no need for that. The only part that was too tight for the 8 was the arms, they weren't as drapey as I would have liked them. One arm was tight, and was bothering me by the end of dinner. It was a wee bit tight across the top. I'm pear shaped, 5'10"", 160 lb, and a 36C. Regardless, I had fun in it, it was super comfy, plenty of compliments, and it had pockets!

No need for extra jewelry because the high neck and sleeves are already great details. Keeps you a bit warm with the lace overlay...it's something for cold nights. TBD Pro / Con: Classy under-boob?

It's a knit material, so it's basically just a clingy knit dress. RTR sent me the large, which might have worked, but there was an odd lump in the hip on that dress -- couldn't figure it out, maybe it was stored on a hanger oddly before it got to me. Potentially I could have gotten away with the Medium, but I just wasn't quite comfortable in it for my event. If I was going out for a super swanky evening I might have reconsidered, I just needed something not quite so form fitting.","March 11, 2019","Small"

I’m generally a 2/4 for dresses and I read a lot of reviews about this dress running small, so I tried getting 4/6 P since I’m only 5’1, but 2/4 P were the only ones available and I didn’t want to have a dress that dragged too much on the ground. The 4 P I ended up wearing to my prom with heels still hit the ground, so regular would’ve been bad! Anyways, 4 P was super small on me and to zip it, I had to do it below my chest and didn’t eat much in preparation to wear this dress. I would highly recommending ordering a size up since this dress was super tight around my chest, I’m a 34 C. I loved wearing this dress to my prom since it’s so unique and I really stood out which was my goal! The pockets were great and I was able to hold people’s phones and keys in them.

If you're a true 34B you're going to want at least the 4P, because the top has no give. I ended up wearing the 4P, and it did touch the floor a bit (I was wearing 4"" inch heels), but it wasn't long enough that people stepped on it a ton.

I did not get any photos of me on the night of but took a few in the mirror the day before. I went bra-less but wish that I had those stick on cups because the fabric wasn't all that thick.

I have a wide chest (not bust) and it was perfectly fitted, so it may be harder for bustier women to wear. The length for my 5'9"" height was above the ankle, kind of mid-length, which looked nice. The bell of the dress was not too wide. It had a great flow to it and was very comfy around the waist since the dress was A-line. The fabric is also thick and heavier than I expected, which allowed the dress to stay in place when standing, but not too heavy to allow it to move nicely when walking. It was also lined, which was an added plus. It was very well made and I enjoyed wearing it, although I most likely won't rent it again.","May 9, 2019","Everyday"

I'm usually a size 4, but sized up to a 6 and glad I did -- i almost think I could have gone with an 8 and been extremely satisfied with it. I have a bit of a pear shape -- smaller chest, but hips -- so I'm thinking this might be great for a more straight/athletic body type.

Beautiful fabric.","I was really looking forward to renting this dress, but it didn't fit how I expected. Usually a shift is tightest at my chest (widest part) and then falls freely. This dress was roomy up top, but more narrow through the hip. It was slightly snug at the bottom, which was a little concerning due to the stretchy white fabric, but was easily fixed with a little shape wear. The shoulder cutout detail is really flattering. I needed to wear a strapless bra since regular straps showed. The material is soft & luxurious, but it does wrinkle in the hip area after sitting for a little while. The paint-like strokes are beautiful and bold. Perfect pattern for warmer weather. Paired with Lizzie Fortunato Tahitian Flower Earrings.

The embroidery is beautiful, but combined with lots of fabric and generous sleeves and the hi/low hemline, a lot is happening here, to the point it felt a little costume-y (like you could drop me right into a Ricola cough drop commercial).

I think I was most excited about receiving this piece than any other in the mail. But it was the most ill-fitting dresses I've ever tried on! I'm a usual 4 but the medium in this (size 6) would just not allow my hips to move and my bust could barely fit. You also couldn't tie the straps until the dress was on you so you could control how high or low you want the dress to be. Trying to get both straps tied at even lengths, while the dress is on you, is no easy feat! Ugh, I couldn't wear this dress at all. Even if I sized up, it'd look too off.","March 16, 2019","Party"

The dress hugged my curves in the right places and I received many compliments. The Cons: The dress has a VERY low cut front. I like cleavage, but this was too low and loose. The only option to make the dress work was a black bandeau top. If this was a dress I owned, I would have had the straps taken up/in and could have gone without a bra, but no amount of pinning would have made it work on its own.

I ended up wearing the 0 as it fit better in the waist and bust than the 2. I'm a 34C, 36-26-37, and the 0 was a little snug on the hips but fit great everywhere else. After about 5 minutes of sitting in the car, the hips weren't snug anymore. It needs a U-bra or tape and you can't wear a slip under it because of the sheer panels, but the lining is perfect. I ended up not wearing a bra because there was too much cleavage for my taste. No bra made for a more natural and less in your face decolletage for a charity function.

Got tons of compliments all night and felt fabulous wearing it! Couple things worth mentioning - the top of the dress is large, based on my experience and other reviews the dress could stand to have an inch or two less of fabric in the straps. Because of this I absolutely used double-sided tape (tried to go without it but realized I wouldn't enjoy a second of the evening if I was constantly adjusting and checking for coverage). Once I made that fix the dress was perfect! Also, the fabric doesn't have a TON of give due to the thick lace work, which I am always wary of because I have wide hips and larger thighs, but my usual size of a 4 still worked out fine, though if the top of the dress hadn't been so large I probably would have opted for the 6 to have a little extra breathing room.","May 28, 2019","True to Size"

This part of the dress was a tad big also, so if it were appropriate for me to where it with full chest exposure, it still didn't fit the best, and I am a 34C.

I would normally wear a 14 in a dress that's straight through the hips like this one, but they only had a 12 so I tried it out. It was a little tight through the hips, but since I had a jacket to go with it, it was fine. I definitely thought the straps were too long, so I think this would be hard to wear as just a dress because they kept falling down.

Not only is the fabric surprisingly thicker than I thought making it look way more expensive/formal than a night gown but the fit is just beautiful.

Wore to a black-tie wedding, and had flashback moments to wearing my princess Halloween costume everyday when I was three years old (i.e., I wanted to do something similar and make this dress my life's uniform). I paired it with my own cheapo emerald-green costume earrings to bring out the green tones at the base of the skirt, and the Kate Spade glitter sima clutch. The colors of the dress don't look SUPER vibrant in this picture, but they absolutely were in real life, as well as in the professional photos from the wedding taken with flash. I didn't wear a bra, as I can't bear strapless bras, and the bodice was fitted enough to provide some support. You'll definitely want to wear heels with this dress regardless of your height due to the tea-length. It's very fitted in the waist, but very generous in the hips with its full skirt.","March 14, 2019","True to Size"

I got the 14 because the 12 was unavailable and it was a little roomy on top but looked great and was super comfortable. A 12 would’ve probably would’ve looked more fitted but felt less comfortable.

However it was so so worth it - so many compliments & the colors were absolutely beautiful. It was perfect for a black tie wedding... especially because it's not a full gown so I didn't have to worry about dancing and going out with my friends after. I'm a true 6 because of my butt and chest and had originally settled on a 6R which fit me well at the store. But when I went back a week later, there was only a 4 available. I'm glad I went with the 4 because it gave me a bit more cinch in the waist without being uncomfortable. It also let me go braless with zero problems! I'm in love with this and am considering buying it! Definitely a showstopper.","March 12, 2019","Wedding"

I never felt more confident, comfortable, or received more compliments in a dress!! I was really nervous about this pick. I had a not so great experience with my initial dress picks, but the Lu at RTR was TOP NOTCH!! She helped me go thru dresses, made suggestions, and ultimately sent me this dress on a whim because I was cautious of size. I would say the top runs large as my bust is bigger and that's where I generally have issues with size 12 dresses. This dress fit like a glove, top to bottom. I didn't have to wear a strapless bra or undergarment. It was tight enough to keep me secure, but loose enough that I was extremely comfortable all night long. The dress is not as bright as pictured, but vibrant and beautiful! The fit and design of this dress was flattering and hit me in all the right spots. The stitching and workmanship of this dress is impeccable. I truly was the best dressed lady at our event. Strangers kept complimenting how amazing this dress was.

I'm usually between a 4 and 6, and I ended up wearing the small. I could have worn the medium as well, but because I'm pretty short (5'2"") the small worked better for me. Midi skirts are tricky for us short people, but this one was perfect. I have a small waist and bigger hips, and because of the waist band I was able to wear it a little higher for a more flattering fit. It's also incredibly comfortable and forgiving. You could easily dress this up or down depending on your needs.","February 26, 2019","Party"

I'd say it runs just a bit small. I usually wear mediums, but opted for the size L back up -- the waistband is a little thin, so it cut into my waist a little more than I would've liked (spanx helped with this!). Also, on a short person (I'm 5'3""), this skirt will hit you around the calf area, so I'd recommend wearing with heels.

The pleat on the front of the dress made me feel like my belly was sticking out, the sleeves were oddly shaped, and the cut-out parts on the back were strange. If it weren't for these cutouts, I think I could have worn a belt for a better fit, but with the cutouts, the back of the dress poked out around the belt. The only positive thing about this dress was that it was comfy. I felt like I spent the day in a housedress.","May 17, 2018","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TME7","Lisa e","Elegant comfortable dress","This dress is a great combination of super elegant and super easy - the unusual draped back and the length make it dressy and yet I would be more than happy to wear it lying around on the sofa. In the end, I only gave it four stars because I'm personally not that big a fan of the print and colors, but that's the only reason. The fabric is quite thin and the back is open (a long slit from neck to waist as well as cutouts at the sides of the back) so it's definitely better for warmer seasons. I wore it with tights and heeled booties to make it work since it's unseasonably cold but it would be nicer when it's warmer. In terms of fit, it's draped and not fitted, but it does nip in loosely at the waist and in my opinion the thin fabric drapes nicely to give a sense of the shape of the body without swallowing you up. If you are short this may be trickier (the length was to the bottom of my knee) but if you are comfortable with this kind of silhouette generally, it's a flattering oversized shape. It would be safe to size down rather than up if you are between sizes as even at the waist it's not really tight.","April 6, 2018",""

The seams on the side didn't hit right since my belly didn't allow the dress to fall to my hips the way it was meant to. The slit in the side then goes pretty high for the same reason.

Definitely size up if you are in your third trimester, but the fabric was nice and light without being see-through and there was plenty of space for my growing bump while still showing enough of my figure I didn't feel like I was wearing a tent (like most maternity dresses).

The only drawback was that the bottom of the dress fell straight down from the largest part of my belly, making me look huge unless I had a hand under my stomach to provide definition. I decided this was okay for a maternity photo shoot (see picture) but didn't want to have to worry about this during my shower, so I went with a different dress from the shower.

I am 5'7"", 130 lb with a 26"" waist and normally wear a size 2-4, so I was hoping the 2 would fit. The 2 was very tight and was very short, so I opted for my backup 8. The 8 was definitely a little too large (especially in the shoulders), but it was the better option. I have a small chest (34 A) and I felt comfortable with the deep V with a little fashion tape. Not sure if I would have felt that way if I was a little bustier. Overall, loved the dress and it was so unique. I got a lot of complements and comments on how pretty the pattern/colors were.

The 4 fit very well, but having a smaller chest I was about it looking and feeling too loose. I used a little fashion tape to ensure the girls didn't pop out or if bending over people couldn't see in.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM268","Elizabeth","The dress runs extremely small. I suggest sizing up or avoiding if your bust is larger than 34.","The dress is absolutely beautiful. I measured the bust area on the size 12 laying flat pit to pit and it measures 16 1/2 inches which is a 33 inch bust. The waist on the size 12 was 30 inches. The size 10 is a 1/2 inch smaller. Reviews mentioned small sleeves but I had no issues with 14 inch sleeve width. I suggest you have TWO dress choices ready. They allow you to request two sizes on each dress but they don’t mention that additional back up dress until ordering. So if your not ready with that second choice at time of ordering you will end up paying shipping charges for that free second choice if your not happy with first choice.","December 18, 2018","Small"

My favorite part was the color and fabric. So beautiful and perfect for fall/winter. The plunge is DEEP I mean like shows your stomach deep. You have to use boob tape 100%, which was challenging especially because the neckline showed allot of the shoulder as well. The most frustrating part was the edge of the fabric on the plunge part of the dress. It wouldn't lay right! The hem kept turning out. I tried to use fashion to keep it down but it didn't work. Although I had the confidence to rock the dress, I constantly felt self conscience and aware that it just wouldn't lay right and I kept fixing it all night. I'd also suggest getting a spray tan for this one too.","November 26, 2018","Wedding"

Once taped I had no concerns about falling out but you have to feel super confident in yourself with such a revealing front. The sleeves (and tape) made it impossible to lift my arms above my head.

I def needed a little ""encouragement"" from the BF to get into the 2, but once in, I think it fit perfectly as intended. I could eat, drink AND breathe all night. Sized up definitely would have looked sloppy. Order your 'reach' size and your 'safety' size. Definitely make sure you have someone to zip you in, regardless. I'm a 34-36B, but despite the very open neckline & low cut, absolutely zero boobie issues for me. No engineering or tape needed. I didn't feel exposed or immodest at all. The reviews? Yea.

I definitely do t regret it or feel like it should be ranked as second choice because the dress fit and flattered and was exactly like the reviews said it would. I didn't give it 5 stars bc some of the stitching was frayed (like it had been worn a lot) on both the dress I wore, size 8, and the backup size 10. Must get double sided tape to prevent anything from showing you don't want seen, and the lining was also a bit worn out so had to reapply tape to keep dress neckline in proper place.

All around, the garment is very easy to move around and breath in with ample room for the hips. This is great for any bust size but I would recommend using a nude bra or going braless. At 5' 10"" with heels, this hits me at a tea length.","October 8, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA329","Leanna","Very sexy, but classy!","Rented this for a wedding, but ended up wearing it the next day for my anniversary dinner. Length was great with heels (otherwise would have been too long on my short frame), and the plunge is very low - so be ready for that. The ""belt"" on mine was only one piece, not two that could be tied, so I couldn't really figure out what to do with it, and I just wrapped it around me and sort of tucked the end in. If I had been dancing a lot I don't think it would have stayed.","October 8, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA329","RTR Customer","LOVE this jumpsuit! I felt like a rock star all night!","Fantastic jumpsuit. Comfortable and easy to get in and out of when going to the restroom. Felt like it masked my trouble area (upper tummy) really well! I did wear a bandeau underneath because the ""ladies"" would have been falling out all night. But that didn't damper the outfit at all to me. One downside was there is only a few stitches holding the fabric together at the top in the back. Sadly, the stitches ripped while I was taking it off to use the bathroom. I don't at all knock the jumpsuit for that though. Danced all night while feeling glamorous!","April 2, 2018","True to Size"

Halston Heritage also makes this style in a floor-length dress, which I've worn before (a great goto for a more formal, black tie affair). The sash ties right below bust and has a nice shiny side for extra detail. Im an A cup and while there's a deep-V cut, I was well covered. I'm 5'8"" and the legs came right to the floor. I wore a 4"" heel, but a smaller heel would also look great. Highly recommend and would definitely rent again!","March 12, 2018","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA329","Elle","Chic Jumpsuit","Overall this is a nice design, a few things to note. 1. The plunge is very low, I wore a bralette in black lace. If a plunge is desired, get fabric body tape. 2. Side zipper is tricky, you need help to zip this! 3. Pockets would have made this an A+ 4. Length was not long on me, I am 5'7.","January 14, 2018","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA329","Jillian","Comfortable, sleek, and loads of compliments!","I ordered the 10 (my usual size) and got the 14 as a back-up (12 was out of stock). The 10 fit perfectly, but the zipper was so hard to use, even on the hanger, that I ended up wearing the 14. It was WAY too big, but the drape on the legs camouflaged the size pretty well. I wear a 34 G and the top was still baggy enough that I had to pin it closed. Do be aware that it is VERY low cut. The legs also run short but in a way that seems to be on purpose. I'm 5'6"" and with a 3.5"" inch heel they were hanging around my ankles. Once we switched to flip-flops (as seen in the picture), the legs hit right at the tops of my feet. Something to be aware of if you're short. All that said, I got tons of compliments and have never been so comfortable at a wedding before.","December 12, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA329","Amy","Cute but a pain","Loved the look of this jumpsuit, but more difficult to get in and out of than your average jumpsuit. Additionally, it needed fashion tape which needed to be fixed up after using the restroom, and the bow is very long, which is hard to keep off the floor in those situations as well. I'm fairly short, but was able to get by with medium height heels in this. Overall, great look - sophisticated and sexy, just a little annoying.","January 3, 2020","Other"

It did run a bit large in the top. The arm holes and bust fit on the loose side which is saying something because I am a 32DD. The waist did fit true to size though so it would be hard to go a size down. I wore a strapless bra because the straps are a bit narrow in the back. Overall, would rent again!

However, the reviews on how this is big up top are no joke- you can't wear a regular bra because of the v in front and back so I had to use safety pins to keep it together. I wore the small but the top half felt more like a medium or maybe even large. It was a great piece but I had to be constantly adjusting the top and even safety pins/fashion tape didn't totally help cause it's thicker fabric than it looks like in pictures.

You would be best off wearing no bra with this because the deep V can go pretty low, but definitely need to use fashion tape to keep the neckline taped to your chest. You can get away with wearing a regular bra if you can fashion tape the two sides together high enough to hide your bra. This runs true to size but is a little bit short so size up for your backup size.","March 12, 2018","True to Size"

This was falling off of me, I would have had to have worn fashion tape to keep the shoulders up. She even had to wear fashion tape to keep it up, even though she wore the xs.

The XS fit in the hips and stayed on my shoulders, but was short in the toosh had I been a half an inch taller my cheeks would've been coming out. Thankfully, it's heavy enough that I wasn't in a constant wedgy situation. As other reviewers mention, know that the sleeves hang on the edges of your shoulders. The wrap/cross is high enough that my boobs were never in jeopardy of coming out (I had on pasties from the dress I wore earlier in the night). I wore this while drunkenly roller skating -- I fell and flailed on more than one occasion -- with no slips.

It also gave my size C/D bust the perfect lift! I did not need any tape or silicone covering because it just fit so perfectly. The dress has pockets! I was able to keep my phone and lipgloss on me all night which is such an underrated treat. Going to the restroom made me feel like Cinderella. You have to be careful and lift the whole dress. You can't go wrong with it!","December 21, 2019","Work"

I would say it does run pretty small in the chest and rib area. I wore 5 inch heels and the length was perfect. It also is thick! I wore this in 50 degree weather and was starting to sweat!","December 18, 2019","Small"

The top was slightly ""gappy"" (fabric tape might have helped if I had some), but overall a beautiful dress. The plum color and fabric is high quality and stunning. I felt like a princess and got lots of compliments.","December 10, 2019","Formal Affair"

I wear a size 6 jeans, but ended up wearing the size 8 dress, and it still kind of smooshed my rib cage. The good part was it created some lovely cleavage I don't usually enjoy! I also did not need a bra because of the thick fabric (and it was a cold night!). I loved the pockets for walking around the party with my phone nearby. And the flare of the skirt was just right on my pouchy stomach. I felt like a princess.","December 4, 2019","Formal Affair"

If I had gone with the 10 it would've been slightly loose in the chest area but would have fit better around my ribs. Other than the sizing, the dress was incredible. I got many many compliments on it. I would definitely rent the dress again.","November 5, 2019","Wedding"

I rented a 14L but I could have sized down to a 12L (my regular size). I had a recent injury and I've gained some weight so I sized up to ensure the dress would fit. The 14L is a hair longer than floor length with no shoes. With small heels it was the perfect length. I was so comfortable the whole evening, ate a ton at the buffet with no insecurities of my belly because the dress hides it great.","October 27, 2019","Formal Affair"

And let's be honest, who doesn't love pockets? I wore a 10L and it was a bit snug even as my back up size, so I would definitely consider sizing up. The cut was a little more daring than I'm used to, but it still looked pretty classy. Loved this dress! And given a chance I'd be thrilled to rent it again.","October 24, 2019","Formal Affair"

The zipper isn’t easy to zip, so have patience. I used lots of tape to keep it from gapping since I’m pretty short-waisted. Even with the very low neckline, it was a very elegant choice that got me lots of compliments at our gala dinner. Beautiful material, and a nice alternative to black!","September 27, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL166","RTR Customer","This dress is magical!! PERFECT for my husbands USAF ball. I’ve never gotten more complements. ♥️","I wore this yesterday to my husband military ball and it was, hands down, the most beautiful dress there. I had at least 10 ladies walk up and tell me it was stunning. We live in Hawaii and it was warm outside and the event was at a beach-side venue, but the dress was lightweight and I didn’t ever get hot. And the girls.. the girls were perfectly perked up, but still classy. I didn’t use tape and didn’t wear a bra.. everything was snug and contained (I’m a 34DD). I literally can’t say enough good things about this gown. ALSO, IT HAS POCKETS!! The whole night I had my lipstick and my phone safe and sound while we danced the night away. I added a second tulle petticoat for extra “poof” and that gave it the perfect ball gown look.","September 22, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL166","RTR Customer","Another winning rental from Monique Lhuillier :)","For reference, I'm ~5'10"", 36 D, and 190 lbs. I'm a 12R in ML dresses. I don't typically play the heel game and was able to wear flats with this dress allowing the hem to fall at a perfect height. Beautiful material that holds its structure nicely throughout the night - it's a bit heavy and can get a little warm when bustin' some moves on the dance floor, but it's worth the wear regardless. I chose to forego the bra with this dress, and I will say that for any of my fellow well endowed ladies on top...this dress is definitely va-va-voom-y. If you aren't comfortable with the cleave, this dress isn't for you. All in all, this dress is a classic...fun to wear, comfortable, flattering to the figure, and will get you compliments all night long. P.S. If you're looking to add some fun flair, I paired it with the NOCTURNE Parure Lapis earrings and they were a great accent to this dress.","September 19, 2019","True to Size"

XD No shame though. This dress was gorgeous! This was actually an overnighted replacement dress that was a different choice than I originally had. I got soooooo many compliments on this dress! It was a real stunner. I'm 5'2"" and with heels the dress JUST touched the ground.","September 8, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL166","RTR Customer","Loved this dress for this event","This dress was my backup but I loved it so much and it ended up being a perfect fit for the event I was attending. I typically wear a 16 and the 16 fit me snugly but comfortably. I wouldn’t wear this if you’re very flat chested or very busty. For me it worked well. Definitely no bra because it’s so low cut. But I taped my boobs up (ala Kim Kardashian) and got so many compliments. I held the straps in place on my shoulders with fashion tape. I went with the 16R even though I’m 5’9” because I knew I wanted to wear flats and it was the perfect length, just grazed the floor. I wore sparkly silver jewelry, gold would also look nice. I’m not sure I would wear this to a wedding or any place I planned to dance a lot, but for my specific event this dress was a winner.","August 27, 2019","True to Size"

For a few hours at the party, this was awesome - the dress was beautiful, I got lots of compliments, and I felt great. But wearing it all night at the concert, the arm-holes felt constricting, the front was so tight it became uncomfortable, and sitting down wasn't the best. I know part of this is that I sized a 0 - I go between zero and two and I think it was meant for someone with a little less bust.","December 9, 2019","Party"

What exactly does that mean, and how do I come up with an outfit with less than a week's notice?? Rent the Runway to the rescue! In my mind, Bond Girl = sequins, so I went for this pink sequined Jay Godfrey number. One cool thing about this dress (that you can't really see from the model photos) is that the sequins kind of ""swish"" back and forth and make a cool design/texture. Only a size 0 was left and I was concerned about it being a tight fit based on previously Jay Godfrey rentals, however the 0 fit me fine and actually felt more like a 2. The size 0 was very short, however, so that is something to consider. This probably wasn't my favorite rental, but it did the trick on short notice!","August 29, 2019","True to Size"

I usually wear a size 4 (27 in jeans), but I ended up wearing my back up size 2 because the 4 was wayyy too baggy for my liking. Actually, I wished I’d gotten a size 0 just so that it fit like a glove! I loved this dress. Yes, it was short but I didn’t mind at all. It’s a very attention-grabbing dress so get ready to have the spotlight on you. And, yes, the sequins did flip back and forth, but I didn’t mind at all. I wore this to my birthday dinner and everyone loved it! By the way, I am 5’2”, 130 pounds, and a size 34C (I wore a strapless bra with this but I didn’t have to pull at the top of the dress to keep it up).","July 22, 2019","Large"

I wore this to a rehearsal dinner that had a dress code of ""Mexican flare."" I got so many compliments on it and it was really comfortable. The only issue that I had was you could kind of see some under-boob because I have a larger bust, but the crocheted fabric was thick enough to hide it, so you did not really notice. I tried on the S and it was too large around my waist, otherwise, I would have worn it as it fit my chest. The XS was a little small, but not small enough to size up. A little tip - I would air this dress out as soon as you get it. The fabric is really thick, and the dry cleaning smell clung to the dress because of this. I sprayed some fabric/wrinkle release spray on it to help with the smell as well.","October 9, 2018","True to Size"

Like other reviews mentioned, the zipper is really hard to move but if you just take it slow and have someone to help you, it isn't a problem. There is absolutely no stretch to this dress so if you are busty, the top will be tight. I was able to wear a normal bra with this but I did find that the blue lining in the top would ride up throughout the day. The pictures do not do this dress justice!

I am rather petite (4'11"" and 100 lbs) and usually wear 00 in most items of clothing. Therefore, the dress was slightly large on me - it hit me right at the knee and was a bit roomy in the waist/hips.

I could barely get it zipped. It looks great but it's so tight around the rib cage/waist. There's no stretch at all, it's really structured, which I love, but it's too tight to sit down in. It's one of those standing room only rompers. It looks great in the chest - deep enough V to be fun, not so deep that it's inappropriate to wear during the day time. The length was perfect on me but I'm only 5'4. Ultimately, I didn't wear it because it was just too tight, but a medium would have been too large everywhere else.","August 23, 2019","Small"

There are a few things about this dress that make it less than ideal: the liner is super small, and it's only sewn in by one hook on the left sleeve, so putting yourself in the dress can be confusing. The hook and eye closure at the waist only has the eye left, so to make the dress lie flat, you'll have to put the hook through the one of the eyelets. There is also no sash with the dress even though it has belt hooks, so you'll have to wear a belt or sash of your own.

I found the rest of the dress to be true to size, though, so I would caution against ordering a size down. I tried on the smaller size and it was too tight everywhere except for the bust. I used fashion tape to secure the top, but it took more tape than expected so I spent the first half of the evening adjusting the top until I could get more tape. My advice: Don't shy away from this dress; it's beautiful and everyone will tell you so.

The dress was comfortable to eat, drink, move and dance in; I ended up spending about 11 hours in it and never thought ""ugh, this is too tight, this is too long,"" etc. I went with a braided updo (courtesy of a talented friend of mine) and simple gold jewelry, with gold heels, to let the color pop.

The floral overlay was so pretty and was fun to dance in. The cinched waist was super flattering as well. I think the length is a little hard. I'm 5'6 and it hit an an ok length. I wish it had been a little higher on my calf, but would be perfect for someone 5'8 or above. I think you can dress this up or down which makes it really versatile.","October 8, 2018","True to Size"

I was worried about wearing this to a summer wedding but the fabric breathed well, and the flowy nature of the skirt helped with ventilation. The 8 fit perfectly, didn't have to wear a bra to fill it out (a worry with many dresses), the front hit right at the perfect spot, just snug enough at the waist to give me shape without being tight, and no issues eating in the dress.

Running small with no stretch, I recommend wearing a size up for your primary size. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works best for A-C cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress o you should wear a strapless bra . At 5’5, the length hit knee length on me. The high low cut of the dress is absolutely stunning and is definitely a fun style. Pair with simple heels and a black clutch to complete your outfit!","March 7, 2019","True to Size"

This was only one of a few dresses available and I'm SO happy I rented it! Rented the 10 & 12 and ended up in 12 for more breathing room. A little big on top, but not noticeable by others. I'm 5'5"" and wore ~3"" heels - the back skirted the floor beautifully! Dress is a frosty-navy color with black lace.

I went with the 12 bc I had more room up top to put a strapless bra underneath without feeling like I couldn't breathe. I'm 5'8 and wore a 3 inch heel. I got the regular length. I can't imagine who would be tall enough to pull off the long. Make sure you measure your shoulder to the lowest point of the gown as I can imagine this being too long for many women. For me this was perfect, fitted up top and flared. No shape wear needed for my mommy tummy. I felt comfortable beautiful all night and received lots of compliments.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SPT9","Marissa","Standout cocktail dress color and pattern for summer wedding.","I'm petite- usually small/medium, US size 5,6,7. I wore the backup UK size 8 and it fit fine. Size 10 fit slightly looser and the sleeves were puffier. Dress length was an inch or so above my knees, perfect length, not too short or long. One downside for me- I have slightly broad shoulders and the v-neck helped narrow down the look of my top half, but since dress sleeves are puffy, it made my shoulders look even wider. V-neck plunged a bit lower on my chest, so definitely needed fashion tape and a push-up bra helps; it's revealing but wasn't inappropriate for outdoor wedding cocktail attire. Overall fun and comfortable dress. Color and pattern really pop out - and looked great with a red lipstick/red earrings.","June 17, 2019","Wedding"

I paired with a cage bra and lots of fashion tape! Front zip made for easy bathroom breaks. I'm 5'7"" and wore flats - hem hit me right at the ankle. The neckline is super adjustable with a belt - fully buttoned would have shown just a hint of cleavage, but I wanted maximum impact. I am a 36B and a store size 6. Jumpsuit was roomy enough to layer on top of a shirt if desired, waist and hips were roomy but not excessively so. I originally rented a small because the medium wasn't available, and the small was way too small in the thighs and torso length. Pockets are large - no need for a clutch with this one. Torso is a teensy bit short - long waisted gals should steer clear. Jumpsuit had clearly been worn a few times before, as it was missing some sleeve buttons, but wasn't super noticeable.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/GRL53","Sara","Loved this jumpsuit so much that I bought it!","I was scared to get the XS but I'm really glad I did. The waist was elastic and had enough give to be comfortable throughout dinner at an Italian restaurant for date night with my husband. Had I ordered the S I'm sure that the top and shoulders would've been too loose to wear as a plunging neckline. Another wonderful thing about this jumpsuit is that I didn't need to use hem tape like I usually do with jumpsuits because at my 5'2"" height, even with 4"" heels jumpsuits have always ALWAYS been too long for me. I loved the different options for how to wear the front, depending on how I wanted to fasten the buttons. For date night, I wore it fully open for the plunging neckline and wore a lace bodysuit from Victoria's Secret so that I wouldn't have to worry about double sided tape and an accidental peekaboob all night. The zipper is in the front, so taking it off to use the restroom felt familiar like pulling down jeans. Even though I still had to take off the top to pull it down, it was so much more convenient than the typical jumpsuits that fasten and zip up in the back. I bought this piece because it can easily be dressed up for a formal event, but I can also wear it the conservative way to work, or as the plunging neckline with a white button up, v-neck tank, or scoop neck tee. Paired with different shoes, belts, and bags, I'm excited for what other looks I can create with the same exact jumpsuit. Thanks RTR!","February 20, 2019","Date"

(You must step into dress or overhead, no zipper but fabric has stretch). This dress is a gorgeous red and makes you feel like Marilynn Monroe. But the Top runs large. I should've rented a 0. You need the top to fit tight and since I am short at 5 '2"" I had to get very creative to make this dress work and not show my chest! I used a clear rubber band to gather the dress behind my neck to take up the extra fabric and wore my hair down ...was completely unnoticeable. Then I pinned The two straps that are the top to the waistband to make it tight and just wore sticky petal covers underneath (no bra possible). I also used some double stick fabric tape just to be safe. It was quite a bit of work to make it all work out but it was totally worth it and compliments for my anniversary and my husband loved it.","October 7, 2019","Vacation"

I rented a 6, but could have gone with a 4 easily. I think the sizing should have been small/medium/large type sizing due to the range of sizes this 6 could fit. If you're not sure how it'll fit, just get your usual size and don't worry. It's fairly magical in fit. You might want to use fashion tape though, unless you're daring like me. :) This is a dress where you will risk sharing. Also, nipple petals will be needed if it's chilly and you don't want to beam your headlights at the world. If you do, cool. It's a sexy dress. The world won't end for it.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PTS15","Claudia","Almost great, a few downsides","The shirt is adorable and the fit was good. However, there were a couple downsides that would keep me from renting this shirt again. One, the loops where you hang the shirt from the hanger-there are two long ones in the back of the shirt (one on each side), and two tiny ones in the front of the shirt (one on each side). The ones in the back can ride up and come out of the top of the shirt. The ones in the front are too small to tuck in the shirt! They stick out from the top of shirt! The orientation of those loops make it impossible to tape them down with fashion tape so they stay tucked in. So basically, if someone gets close to you, they can see these two little loops sticking straight up on each side of your chest/neckline. It's embarrassing. Second, the sleeves easily get into food while eating, so you have to be careful of that.","May 4, 2019","Everyday"

Do read all of the reviews though because the dress runs very small. Though I had no trouble zipping the size 6R, my ribcage was pretty sore by the end of the night. This dress is also surprisingly long. The model on the site must be at least 6' 1"" because even in four inch heels the longest point of the dress had at least 2"" of fabric dragging on the ground.

Fit was as expected (just keep in mind the the primary sizes are UK sizes, and the material of this dress isn't stretchy). With my measurements, was a bit looser in the waist than what would be ideal, but it was still super flattering and comfortable. Plus, the material is sturdy and the draping is super well done – even though I wore this to a ball with lots of waltzing, didn't find that I was having to constantly adjust the dress to get it back to a flattering position, which I often have to do at dances! Also, LOVED the color on the dress. Definitely a statement color, but very rich instead of being straight up neon. One thing to keep in mind is it's longer than one would think, based on the model photos – for a reference point, I'm 5'8"" and wore 2"" heels, and the longest part of the dress was just barely off the ground and sometimes skimmed it (lifting it up in the photo included, because didn't want to get it dirty outside haha)","February 5, 2019","Formal Affair"

I got so many compliments on it. The front does go very low, so as long as you have a way to keep yourself situated, you'll be fine. I wore a deep v bra (because I just can't make myself go braless) and was good to go. The length was perfect with flats on. It brushed the tops of my feet. I do wish I had gotten the 6L because it was very cold, and I ended up wearing wedge boots, so it was a little short.","February 26, 2020","Wedding"

There is a ton of fabric - my guess is that short women will not like this dress as much because they may feel like they're drowning in it with all the fabric!

The print went wonderfully with the gorgeous fall leaves and made for some pretty outstanding photos. The only thing I was not thrilled with was how the bust was cut. As many of the other reviews have said the dress is very low cut making it hard to wear a bra underneath. I used a lot of gaffer tape and double sided tape to prevent me from being completely scandalous and to keep my 40 DD bust from looking super saggy.","November 11, 2019","Other"

Many of the reviews said the dress ran long and large in the chest. I am 6' tall with size A36 chest and I found that it was actually true to size, maybe even a bit small! The 10L wasn't available so I got the 10R and it was fine especially since I wore flats and danced a lot but still would have preferred the 10L. No problems with the chest. I was able to wear a strapless bra no issue. When I raised my arms up the shoulders sometimes fell off. Also, a couple times the bell sleeve got caught in the zipper of my purse. Other than that it was great and super flattering! Highly recommend!","September 17, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS95","Michelle","AMAZING for a warm summer wedding.","The slits on this dress might not work for all weddings, but I loved it and got so many compliments. I have large upper arms and this dress was not tight there which was amazing. One thing is that shapewear with built in shorts will likely poke through the slits - so you'll need to use double stick tape to close the slits a bit. But truly I loved this dress. 100% would recommend.","August 25, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS95","Rebecca","4 Star rating based solely on look and fit, BUT...","I absolutely loved everything about this dress. It fit me perfectly, was flowing and comfortable, and a perfect balance of beautiful and sexy. I received nothing but compliments. HOWEVER, I will be hesitant to rent another dress from RTR! I received the dress, briefly tried it on to ensure that it fit properly, and hung it in my closet. It must have been a combination of the amount of time I had it on while ensuring its fit, and the fact that both times I put it on, I did so by stepping into the dress (as the wide neckline allowed this) that I somehow was unaware of the condition in which the dress was sent to me. Unfortunately, i didn't realize until it was too late (while stepping out of the car at the event on a breezy day) that the dress wreaked of body odor! The smell was so pungent and concentrated that it was unbearable! There is NO possible way that this dress was properly laundered/dry cleaned between rentals. The smell coupled with the realization that I was wearing a dress that was at one point obviously soaked in someone else's sweat, made the situation even more disgusting. As much as I hate to say it, I don't know that I could confidently rent a dress again without the uncertainty of whether or not I would be receiving a clean, non odorous dress. Such a terrible and disappointing experience!","July 30, 2019","Wedding"

She had an Indian wedding, so I wore traditional Indian clothes for the ceremony, and then wore this for the reception. It was very lightweight, even with the long sleeves and floor length. I LOVED the slit up the thigh. The dress does have a deep plunge, but because it's so lightweight, double-sided tape worked really well with it. I received so many compliments on this dress, and now I'm obsessed with this style. I wish I could afford to buy it!","July 21, 2019","True to Size"

The sleeves are beautiful but was really worried I'd catch fire trying to cook in them. I kept having to hold them out of the way but I doubt too many others would try to cook in this!! I went bless which made it uber comfy but I will say it fit me a little more like a mum than a fitted maxi. The ""waist"" is a band just below the bust but it was pretty big (even for the rib cage) and didn't add much form to the dress. The skirt is also VERY full and adds a few inches across the hips as well. I don't think a size down would have fit length wise as the chest length was barely long enough. At 5'9"" the 10R fit perfectly with flats so roller girls definitely need the Long if you want to wear this with heels. It was a great dress for a ""home for the holidays"" dinner but I doubt I would have worn it out.

I would have bought it through my unlimited membership if I lived in a place where I could wear it more than once or twice a year. It fit basically true to size, maybe it runs just a tad big but not by much. I'm usually an 8, which would have fit fine but I went with the 6R and it was just snug enough to fit my chest area well without making me self conscious about by my stomach area.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS95","Ruth","Coachella princess vibes","I got this dress as a surprise backup from RTR when my original choice wasn't available, and it was SO much better than the one I would have picked. It's insanely flattering. I was worried it'd be too summery for a November event, but the colors are autumnal and the fabric heavy enough that it worked perfectly. The sleeves are so fun -- I was singing at this wedding and felt like I'd gone full Florence & the Machine. The way the silk flows makes you feel like all eyes are on you, even when you're just walking to the buffet. If you feel comfortable going braless (I did), the cut is perfect, though I did use a little tape on the shoulders. And the print is bold yet simple enough that you could go minimal or maximal with accessories -- I went with sea-green earrings and a simple necklace. I'm 5'8 and the 6R just brushed my feet, so I wore flats; if I'd wanted to go for heels I'd have liked a 6L, but that's such a minor issue. I got compliments on it from wedding guests across every age and gender spectrum. I loved wearing it so much that I refused to take it off even after I went home, just swanned around my apartment in it for a while. Returning it was a wrench.

The bodice area should have had some additional structure built in to accommodate for the non-adjustable straps - at least some built in cups. I am a B cup and given the thin, pliable nature of the fabric, I kept having to pull up the straps and ending up wearing a white sweater over the dress to insure no slips as the fabric in the chest area can flip down easily.","May 31, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TJ11","Sophie","FAVORITE rental so far!","The fit on this dress is perfection, especially if you want to accentuate an ""hourglass"" figure. Super lightweight, so fun to twirl in, and received endless compliments from friends and strangers all evening. Though it fit like a glove, next time I rent it I may go up a size so that post meal and dancing I'll have more room for movement in the very fitted bodice. I wore this dress to an evening farm wedding, but can imagine wearing it to a dressy brunch, during the day with a denim jacket, or even with a fitted sweatshirt over it and Nike Cortez sneakers for a feminine city look!","September 3, 2018","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TJ11","RTR Customer","This was the first dress I’ve rented, and I love it. As my friends said, “This is Erin in a dress.”","It’s bright, happy, and comfortable. It was perfect for my bachelorette. And, most importantly, IT HAS POCKETS, y’all. Like, real pockets that can fit a phone, not those dinky pockets you can put a quarter in. This came to mid-calf for me, and the waist hit me at just the right spot. I wore this with a pair of slip shorts and it was incredibly comfortable - not too big, not too tight. The only thing I didn’t like is that the straps aren’t adjustable. They were really long on me, and I felt like I was constantly adjusting so I didn’t flash someone. I had a friend safety pin some of the slack for me and it was fine after that, though.","August 21, 2018","True to Size"

It's a great fusion of a traditional and sexy, with a full, midi-length skirt and an almost bustier-style top. It could have been a little revealing, but a little double-sided tape helped prevent any wardrobe malfunctions. I would definitely rent this again.","August 14, 2018","Everyday"

I wouldn't mind owning it for a normal weekend sundress though. The tie in the front took some time to get right. It initially kept rotating awkwardly so that it was vertical rather than horizontal. The only downside about the fit for me is that the straps aren't adjustable and kept slipping off my shoulders. I would shorten them if I owned this dress.","August 12, 2018","True to Size"

The dress is so beautiful but very low cut. I mostly wore it with a chambray button up tied at the waist which looked so good! It's also a bit tight in the chest but i couldn't go bra-less because the fabric was too thin. It certainly provides some lift if you wear a bra! If this was cheaper I would buy it in a heartbeat.

This was my backup dress, but I ended up liking it more than my first pick. I do wish I had a size 4 to try on, but the 6 worked for me.

Also, people have mentioned this- but the garment straps are close to impossible to keep inside. If I were to pick this, I would probably do a single stitch on the inside of the dress or physically tape them down.","July 17, 2019","Formal Affair"

I was nervous to wear it because it's completely out of my comfort zone as form fitting as it is. The neckline is so flattering, showing enough shoulder to make you feel sexy, but not exposed. The fabric is thick and has great stretch. It held in my ""mom bod"" perfectly, but did not restrict my movement. At 5'10"" the long length was perfect with 2 inch heels.

I decided to give it a try and it worked. The ruching allowed for it not to look loose and adjust the length a bit so not too long. I'm 5'5"" and was able to make the long work although the regular length would have still been fine with heels bc I could have pulled it down a bit. Very comfortable and no adjustments needed during the night. Highly recommend","December 8, 2019","Formal Affair"

Material is thick and felt expensive. Loved the angle of the top/neckline. Simple and classic, but not boring.

My issue was with the shoulder area: there is rubber piping that's meant to keep the dress in place but the fabric folds over so it was exposed. The back also tended to gap showing the interior of the dress. Possibly better for a larger bust or shoulders. I received this dress with tags still on :)","November 19, 2019","Wedding"

I usually wear a 4 or 2, and I probably should have ordered an 8 to be comfortable in this dress. Every time I sat down, it bunched up and needed adjusted. And the neck line kept needing adjusted. The only 2 pros- it was flexible and I was at least able to get up stairs moving my legs fluidly, and the color was gorgeous. Overall, if you are perfectly fit and have a wonderfully toned body with zero flaws, this would be the dress you'd like to wear. Also if you have a bigger chest size you might do better as well.","March 29, 2020","Small"

Would have preferred the 12 to be a regular, not a long but it was not available. Overall it worked out with the shoes I wore. The material was very strong and durable and felt it held my mom body in well. No UPS store open on Sunday when I needed to return, but the bag fits perfectly in a UPS drop box. I really don’t like shopping for dresses especially when I am probably only going to wear it once.

I generally wear a size 12 and the 10 fit perfectly so I recommend sizing down. I wore the dress for graduation and drinks afterwards - probably 6-7 hours total - and was comfortable the entire time even in the heat and humidity of the Midwest.

The 6 was a little big, but I made it work. I used a bit of fashion tape on the sleeves side to avoid any gaping and just for the psychological comfort of knowing that it wouldn't slip down.

I'm 5' 7"" and the dress came right to the floor. With heels, it was the perfect length. And the best part, it has pockets!

The fabric was very comfortable. Because I am short, and could only get a regular length, the dress did come down to just below my calf, but honestly, with the shape and flow of the dress, it looked fine. Based on the body types and sizes worn of some of the reviews I read before I rented, I went up a size than is normal and was very glad I did. I wasn't really happy with the waist and the little rope belt tie that came with the dress, so I found a wide black belt that really made the waist better and taped most of the belt flat at the waist with the rest hanging down into the pleats of the dress and then matched that with a black necklace with gold accents and black shoes. IMO, a wider belt looked much better on people like me that might have a thicker waist.","February 27, 2019","Small"

As with the other Fuzzi designs I've tried, the fit is very flexible (it's made of layers of stretchy small-mesh-like fabric that is see-through when one layer (over the arms) and completely opaque when two layers). It's also incredibly flattering--I honestly have no idea how they do it. I felt like I stood out at the event in a crowd of dark formal dresses and felt sexy (callout to the above-the-knew slit over the left leg--it showed especially when walking quickly due to the flowiness of the fabric), but modest with the high neckline. I didn't need any shapewear (I think even tights would have been difficult with the mesh-ish fabric unless they were really silky). It also folds down really small and would be perfect for packing (though you may want to let the skirt hang overnight or steam it in a bathroom during a shower to get any slight wrinkles out after folding/traveling).

However, it still had the tags on it so I figured I'd give it a try. Once on, it's not too see-through in the legs. The pleating on the skirt makes the silhouette more flattering and less sheer.

If you're ok with that, go for it my short girl friends! The middle was a little snug on the 2R, so I decided to wear the 4R. The fun part about this dress is how you can maneuver it to work for you. I decided to pin the green drapey piece in front over my shoulder and wear it off the back. With fancier earrings and heels, the dress worked for this particular formal affair. Overall, I would consider the crepey fabric to be a bit casual for a formal affair. It would be a great piece for a spring/summer wedding.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT44","Isabella","Colorful and flattering!","I was invited to an Indian/Pakistani wedding. I opted out of the Sari dress tradition but wanted something that was inspired by the theme. This dress was just perfect. Colorful, flowy, asymmetrical and overall fun! I got nonstop compliments and couldn't be happier and more comfortable in this design. The Marchesa chandelier earrings completed my look. Just a note in length. I wore a 2R size... My 5'7 height and 5"" heels were just right for this. Any shorter, and the dress would be dragging.","August 13, 2018","Wedding"

Despite that slight design flaw I felt pretty and enjoyed the dress. The dress I got was in poor condition, with a messed up zipper (zips fine, but the top of the notion sticks out). I had tried it on in the store and that one was stained and the seam was ripped. I had this one mailed, but it too disappointed.","August 12, 2018","Everyday"

It has buttons on the slot so you can make it more or less conservative. I opted for a few buttons undone to give me more room to walk and dance.","August 8, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT44","Yuh-line","Beautiful ruffles that hide it all","A dress that hides all your imperfections and makes you stand out in a room. I recently gained a bit of weight from work and had to go up a size from my regular clothes. This dress is true to size with no stretch. It has a bit of flexibility though because the zipper is on the side and there are a lot of ruffles. I would still size up to be safe. I loved the way the whole dress laid. It doesn't really wrinkle or maybe the whole thing is just kind of supposed to be wrinkly but the material makes it so you don't have to iron or steam. The no sleeve and the random hanging piece was cute but I decided to just put that piece around my shoulder as a sleeve piece too. It looked nice. Got so many compliments it became the main talk of the entire gala. The slit up the front is gorgeous. It is modest and buttoned down but the min you want to show a little leg, it does it beautifully. Love this dress.","June 23, 2018","Formal Affair"

It's not a good look on a dress. I can't get rid of this back poof no matter how I adjust the waist. I tried pulling the dress down, and scooting the band up to create a poof around the front.

The fit was good overall. I liked the lightweight, flowy material. The empire waist was flattering, however, like another review, there was a bit of fabric that popped out in the back.

It has a belt of fabric at the empire waist but there is no stretch to this belt of fabric. I always find dresses like this, particularly when coupled with a side zipper like this one is, to be extremely uncomfortable around my rib cage. At 3 months pregnant, this dress nicely hid my bump and was super cute for work, but pretty uncomfortable around my rib cage. If I rented it again, I'd size up. Also, it is low cut, so I wore it with a black camisole underneath.","January 9, 2019","Small"

The colors were a little less vivid than I expected as well. While I did actually receive a compliment on it, I just didn't like how curvy it made me look as it did really accentuate my bustline.

I'm 38F and I would guess anyone bigger than 34C will need something to bridge the gap in the front (It was a solid 4 inches exposed on me). The fabric is light and airy (perfect for a summer night out) but has absolutely no give . It's a flattering fit and I like the cap sleeve, which seems at the shoulder but is loose over the arm. It was just a touch shorter than I wanted it to be so I didn't where it to work, but was fine for an evening out with friends.

Cons: typical wrap-dress problems – tendency to open a bit in the skirt at the front, and top nightmarishly large and required garment-taping or it would have gapped open. The proportion was a little off for my body as well, so even though I am fairly long in the torso, the straps at the back were too long and hung loose instead of lying flat and taut (because the waist can be tightened with a belt and the top part of the neck fits rather like a halter, those straps sit loose rather than the entire top being too loose which is ultimately a good thing). Overall a beautiful dress for an event or party but a bit insecure for everyday wear – I wore it for a post-work event and also wore it all day at work.","June 12, 2018","True to Size"

I wore it for about 4 hours but was literally itching to take it off by the time we got home. I actually had my partner scratching my back at the bar to relieve the discomfort haha.

After reading reviews, I was initially pretty concerned about the fit, but the XS fit me very well, and wasn't so tight that I couldn't sit down comfortably. I wore a regular T-back nude bra, and it was unnoticeable. The lace and mesh parts of this dress are a little itchy, but you don't notice that at all after a drink or two. My one biggest complaint with this dress is that the little black bands on the sleeves near the elbow are not stretchy AT ALL. I have skinny arms, and I was still unable to lift my arms above my head without fear of ripping the arms somehow. The length was also good, hitting me about four inches above the knee (I""m 5'6).

Once I had those spanx on, I felt amazing. I couldn't figure out why other reviews said it was so short, but once I had it on, I definitely understood!

As far as fit, I did feel a little self conscious with the top gaping a bit (but I'm also small busted and it may fit better on a larger bust). The front skirt of the dress doesn't conceal much when sitting due to the high cut slit, but with a bit of patience and adjustments, wasn't too bad!

The slit is quite high, but the long length and flowy shape balances it out. A standard strapless bra won't work with the deep V neck, so I went without. Used silicone pasties and double sided tape.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG137","Grace","Standout color!","I loved the way this dress looked on. It was fun and vibrant for a black tie summer wedding. A couple of things to be aware of - you can't wear spanx or a bra with this dress because of how low the back is. You also probably want to invest in some fashion tape to make sure the top doesn't reveal more than you want it to. Seems to fit pretty true to size - I didn't even try on the 0 because the 2 seemed fine, although maybe the 0 would have felt less revealing in the top? One other thing, the way the dress is made the front part opens all the way up, essentially one long slit up the front. So I just had to be aware of that, particularly sitting/standing getting out of cars. Also when I walked I would hold the dress on that side to keep it all together. I would have used fashion tape there, but I was worried the dress may not lay as nicely if I did that. All in a little high maintenance, but in my opinion, worth it! Lovely dress.","July 24, 2019","Wedding"

Let me say that I was on the fence after reading some reviews, but I'm so happy I took a chance. True to size, yes, but I wish I would have gotten my backup a size down rather than a size up. The fabric is light and flows perfectly. Sheer, yes, but not unmanageable. I wore high waisted nude spanx panties without a problem. The top...I am a small C cup and Hollywood Fashion Breast Lift Tape did the job perfectly! Two small pieces of tape along the seam on the chest for good measure and all was well. I am 5'6"" and 165lbs. The 10R fit perfect with 3 inch heals. The compliments were unending and still coming days later. If you want to make a statement, this is your dress!","July 16, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG137","Melissa","The best highlighter yellow dress I could ever hope for","Super fun dress that I got many compliments about. I was initially worried about the low cut top and the slit that other people were talking about. I had a few ""Marylin Monroe"" moments when I walked over a floor AC unit, and I was careful walking up stairs and when I was sitting down but it didn't take away from me being able to enjoy the night. I didn't want to wear heels in this dress, so I was delighted when it just brushed the ground when I wore flats (I got regular length and I am 5'9"") so if you want to wear heels and you are my height or taller, maybe consider getting a long. I wore a sticky bra from Target and had a few moments when you could see the lining of the bra when I sat down, but I think some fashion tape would have solved that problem. As you can see in the photos, the dress in daylight looks more like a highlighter yellow which I LOVED, and when photographed in low light looks more like a bright yellow. Super fun dress, fit great and I had a blast wearing it. One other noteworthy tip, if you are planning on wearing shapewear with this dress, because of the high slit you will need a thong bodysuit or pull a Kim K moment and cut off a leg/legs of some shapewear because the slit goes high enough you will see the shapewear on your thighs.","July 12, 2019","True to Size"

This was my back up dress but ended up wearing it because, wow...it’s unique! Several people popped over to our table to say they loved it too. The open back style was beautiful but not over the top. The slit goes all the way up...so just be wise while walking quickly. I had no trouble dancing in it. I did use 2 safety pins to keep the front of the dress somewhat closed. Wore an adhesive bra from Target for this & it worked beautifully with the open back. The dress is BRIGHT yellow. You will stand out in a sea of black dresses!

Second, Jay Godfrey knows how to make a woman feel elegant and sexy at the same time. Slit goes all the way to the waist since it's basically just a simple wrap technique. Be careful when sitting or you'll show your undies haha. It fits pretty much TTS, but the waist could have been slightly tighter and also I have small boobs for size 4, so it was a little gappy. Also I'm 5'10 and wore flats and it was dragging on the ground, so the 4L is perfect for tall girls. Overall AMAZING dress and will be renting again.","June 20, 2019","Formal Affair"

If I had a spare $1,200 I would buy it in a heart beat. The dress was so, so flattering, and the bottom portion of the dress was really flirty and added a really fun element to the dress. The silk fabric did wrinkle under my bust and on my thighs after a 1 hour car drive, but I didn't feel like the wrinkles ruined the look. I found it to be true to size. It did loosen up a bit throughout the night, so if you are in between sizes, I would probably order a size down for your backup. I felt comfortable, confident and beautiful at the wedding I attended and would rent this dress again and again. I see it being a universally flattering cut for all shapes and sizes. I'm curvy and this dress really accentuated me in all of the right places while hiding some of my lumps and bumps. No bra was needed, either.

The skirt was perfect for dancing. I loved the way it swished and twirled as I moved. The bold floral looked great and was definitely unique. Regarding fit, there's not a lot of give in the fabric, so if you're between sizes, you might need to go a size up. That being said, I didn't feel like it actually ""ran small."" Also, as the picture makes clear--the fabric wrinkles pretty easily, so it wasn't great for a 45 minute car ride to the wedding.","August 8, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CS57","Anna","Beautiful dress that is fun to twirl in!","This is a flattering dress that fits true to size, but might be a bit tricky on very pear-shaped women. I am a small-busted hourglass (or mini pear), so the size 2 fit perfectly on the bottom, but was too loose in the bust and waist, and the size 0 fit perfectly in the bust and waist, but was very snug around my butt/upper thighs. Since the material DOES have a bit of stretch, I decided to go with the smaller size. This ended up being the right decision because the dress loosened up over the course of the evening-- right in time for dinner and dancing! The silk is study enough that despite it being white, I was able to go braless and sans shapewear without any imperfections showing through. The material tends to wrinkle a bit, so take your pictures before you do a lot of sitting!","August 4, 2017","True to Size"

I cannot even convey how many compliments I got on it, so I definitely felt very confident in the dress. It was form-fitting until about mid thigh, maybe a bit higher, but then it flared out a bit, giving it a great mermaid shape. It was a true midi dress on my 5'5"" frame. I wore a strapless bra and some spanx, mostly because the white is a little bit see-through. Just don't plan on wearing obnoxious colored underwear. The dress wrinkles a bit as you wear it, but it didn't bother me. I really loved wearing this dress; this was a great first RTR experience. Highly recommend!

It runs true to size, however I recommend sizing up because the fabric is quite thin and will show every line. Consider having some shapewear on standby. Works for big busts if you have a good strapless bra, but no built-in support.","July 10, 2017","Party"

Hemline reached the perfect spot on my legs. My husband loved the dress! Picky stuff that picky people might like to know: 1) No bra necessary... hooray! 2) The pink is more of a light bubblegum pink than a blush, but the color looks good on. 3) If you are uncomfortable with your stomach, this is an ideal dress. It shifts attention and gives you a great defined waist. 4) If you don't think your derrière is the best, you might feel uncomfortable without shapewear. (Note: there is a very high slit that might show long shorts.) My ""seat"" is not toned and dimples showed a little bit at times through the dress, even with light shapewear. The overall look made it worth it though!","August 26, 2019","True to Size"

I actually got this dress by accident - but was happy when I saw it. Until I read the reviews, which are spot on. The sleeves have zero give and make it impossible to lift your arms. I wore this to a bar mitzvah in synagogue and it looked terrific - but even with the back three inches open at the top (and hidden by a jacket) I was very uncomfortable. It's not the overall sizing- as you can see from the picture the rest of it fit perfectly. A huge bummer, but glad it was just a rental! Also-- one more word of caution: It's not black!! I didn't realize until I left the house and realized I was wearing black tights, shoes, and jacket with a navy dress.","March 25, 2019","Small"

This dress is made for someone with my body type - it fit perfectly. It has no stretch, and you can't lift your arms above your head, but I found it to be completely comfortable. The only small issue is that I don't think you could zip up the back if you don't have help - the zipper tape gets stuck in the zipper easily, and my husband had to carefully work it up the back.","November 19, 2017","Date"

I have a long torso, so maybe it's just my proportions but I didn't feel I could lift my arms without feeling restricted. Also, while I sized up (typically 8/10) the bust was still snug and gave me the ""uniboob"" feeling (36D). Size up for your backup.","January 14, 2017","Work"

So don't get it if you need to move around a lot, dance with your arms in the air, lift things, etc. That being said, the material is gorgeous, unique and eye-catching. The zero fit me perfectly, like it was a custom dress. This would not be a good dress for a person who wears a small size and has a larger chest though - the fabric does not have any stretch. E.g.,I am very flat chested and it fit perfectly, in that department. Seems like it would be good for work, winter bridal shower, charity event, date night, etc. I wore it with boots because it's cold and I wore it to work, but would look really good with nude heels.","December 15, 2016","True to Size"

The only reason for the less than 5 star review is because I didn't realize there was a cut out in it upon ordering or I wouldn't have ordered it. I still wore anyway though. My dress had a very finicky zipper and I had to slip into it with it only half way unzipped. Apologies for the odd picture. My boyfriend took this just for my review.","July 27, 2019","Party"

I got a lot of compliments, it's very fun. My husband said the colors reminded him of watermelon bubblegum. You can't really tell from the pictures, but the midsection is see-through lace (so are the shoulders). However, the green lace is really tightly woven, so I don't think the cut out is super noticeable. However, my biggest issue was the white band covering the bust was not generous enough for my bust size. Like more than 1/4 of my bust/bra fell below the white band, which you could kind of see through the lace, so I had to wear a white cami underneath. I tried to show this in the picture. If you look close, you can kind where the line of the white band falls (and how much of my bust is below it). Smaller chested girls shouldn't have an issue.","May 24, 2018","True to Size"

Secondly, there is a lot of material around the hips area. Typically I like items that are loose in the hips because I am have bigger hips/thighs but there was way too much material in this dress. The pockets added to the poofy look around the thighs. It was very unflattering and made my thighs look huge.

It is extremely fitted in the rib cage--from just below the boobs to the natural waist. I wasn't sure if I would get it zipped, but once done it was like second skin. While small through the upper rib cage, the boobs have plenty of room due to the tie in front. This combination makes for a very boob-a-licious dress! I kept it for two weeks hoping for the right occasion, but never felt it was the appropriate. The dress, made with fine quality fabric and an extra full skirt bests lends itself to a party or event. It is a party dress. I had hoped that I could wear it out to dinner on the weekend. It's not just that it was a little dressy but I felt I needed a date, an escort, in such a boob-a-licious dress.

A couple of things to note- had I put this dress on the conventional way, it would not have fit. The top is extremely snug- I ended up loosening the chest tie before sipping up the dress and once in was zipped, adjusted the tie. Also- I have a very short torso so the waistband hit right at the narrowest part of my waist and had my torso been longer (or even normal length) it may not have been as flattering.

The medium was tight on my Size C boobs, but made the girls look nice- I would just need petals or a sticky with this top cause it was nice and fitted in the chest. Now the wrap was another story- it's adjustable where you wrap it if you wanna make it more cropped you can or could make it longer BUT the ties looked like two extra sleeves hanging at my waist.

I think if the strap was shorter, maybe my and inch or two, the dress would have fit MUCH better. Pretty dress just not for me.","October 30, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS70","RTR Customer","Somehow gave me curves and a waist (black magic)!","I unfortunately was not able to actually attend the wedding, but I'm in love with this dress. I have an athletic build and am pretty boxy but by some sort of black magic, this dress made me look beautifully curvy and as if I have a small waist. Loved the one shoulder, I felt stunning in this. The fabric was thick enough to hide any insecurities but still lightweight overall. I'm 5'5"" and wore my little 1-1.5"" heels - hem of the dress just grazed the floor. Color is a dark brick/deep wine.","October 23, 2019","Wedding"

The fit was perfect all over with the exception of a tiny bit of gaping in the chest and under the left arm (to be fair, I didn't wear a bra). I normally wear a 4 and found the 4L fit me best. I wore 3"" heels and the dress just reached the bottom of my shoes. Super happy with my choice and would definitely rent again for a formal event.","October 16, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS70","Sarah","I got so many compliments on this dress- It was very flattering!","This was actually my back up dress and ended up fitting much better fit than I imagined it would be. The color is so fun and a nice flattering alternative to wearing black. I typically wear a size 6 or 8. However due to the lack of give in the material and it being a little more form fitting, I ended up wearing a size 10 and it fit perfectly. I wore 3"" heels and am 5'9"" and the 10L ended up being the perfect length.","September 29, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS70","Kristin","It worked for the purposes I needed it for.","I really loved this dress in the pictures and the reviews seemed like it would work for my body. I'm pretty petite, so it was a little bit big all over. I wore a silicon sticky bra, which helped the top, but kept having to readjust all evening since it was just a bit big. It worked, but I wouldn't wear it again, although if I had a little bit more to fill it, I might feel differently. Some of the other reviews said the dress kind of stretched as the night wore on, which was even true for me, despite the fact my body wasn't filling it out quite right.","September 24, 2019","Large"

I have a short torso, and a small busy line, which resulted in the top feeling a bit ill fitting. I’m 5’1, and wore 3 inch heels making the length perfect. The leg slit is a sexy touch but i still felt covered and appropriate. The color is PERFECTION. The fabric is nice and thick, so I didn’t wear spanks (think smooth skin). I would recommend this dress.","September 13, 2019","True to Size"

The stretch allowed me to eat and dance without feeling stuffed in a dress. I really loved the slit in the one shoulder. It's very flirty. I kept my look simple. I wore earrings, gold bangle, gold clutch, black/gold heels, sleek hair, ring, and glam neutral makeup. My measurements 36 top, 27 mid, 40 hip.

I was also upset that I was unable to get the replacement in time to choose another dress. Since I had no other choice I wore the purple dress so I was denied a refund.

Rent the Runway quick and efficient with their service.","I'm a nurse and brought my man to a Nurses' Ball. I received SO many compliments on the dress. Multiple women wore bold colors like black, red, or blue... so the burgundy stood out in a unique kind of way since it isn't the very first color people consider wearing. The design is lovely and not restricting as I thought it would be since it crosses across the chest. It really accentuated my features: slightly wider shoulders, slightly big bust, smaller waist, and narrow hips with a shaped booty. Haha, my bust is a bit more than my lower half; this dress made my lower half look a little more as I would like it to be so it was really nice. This wasn't originally my dress and my original one came in the day before the event in the early afternoon. So Rent the Runway was nice enough to have the option of ordering a backup by 6PM online! It arrived the next day which was the day of the event and it arrived early in the afternoon again.","May 1, 2019","True to Size"

The material is thick and has a good amount of stretch allowing for you to go braless or wear a nubra, but the minimal bust support makes this dress best for cup sizes A-C.

This was actually my backup dress, but I decided to wear it because it was so flattering on. I believe this dress would look great on a variety of body types. The bottom ruffle was such a fun detail, and the fabric is ruched over the tummy in a way to hide sins. Although strapless, it stayed up with no issue. I felt more comfortable wearing a strapless bra under this dress, but it's designed in a way that you don't necessarily have to. The only negative thing I can say about this dress is that it was a little hard to put on. There is an internal strap around the bust with lots of eye hooks that my husband needed to do for me. Otherwise, it was absolutely perfect!","February 21, 2019","Formal Affair"

Boning up top, but a strapless bra helped shape and keep the dress up nicely. The material is thick, but would recommend spanx to help smooth out the hips. Rouching along the front was so flattering, and the slit with ruffles went juuust high enough (mid thigh). Got compliments all night and felt beautiful.

Running true to size with some stretch, I recommend going up one size for your back-up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. At 5'8, the length hit tea length on me. This dress works well with any cup size and can be worn with a strapless bra. This style can be worn to a wedding or on a night out.

Even with a strapless bra, the top was too loose :( There are some fabric folds in the stomach area that hang oddly and move around; this is not a good fabric for holding anything in.

I also felt fancy enough to jump into family portraits after the ceremony without feeling frumpy. I have a long torso and typically have issues with jumpsuits but this one fit me perfectly.

It was too large in the body but too tight around the hips/butt (there's an internal piece of fabric that covers your butt/hugs your hips and was way too tight on me. I assume this is meant to prevent your underwear from showing through the fabric). I tried turning the jumpsuit around, thinking I had it on backwards, but alas. I had high hopes for this one as I was meaning to bring it on vacation with me, but I just could not make it work. On the upside, I love the idea of this piece. The design looks great in the product pictures and on other girls. The fabric was also a luxurious, gorgeous pink/peachy silk.","February 21, 2019","Vacation"

I did read reviews that said there was a slit in front and it was a little lower cut. I'm on the taller side - the skit basically went to right below my private's! Holy heck!! I didn't think the top was too low cut - it fit me well. I do have a smaller rib cage and this fit perfectly which to me means it might run small right under the bust area. But then the bottom was really flowy and a little A-line-esque. I wore it to see cirque du soleil on a rainy day in Southern California so thankfully I could wear it with tights and boots and a leather jacket since it is light material. I don't think I could have worn it on its own without tights. As it was I got several comments from my family members about how high the slit was!

It's really fine and just above the knee a little bit for shorter people like me. It's definitely not work appropriate. Definitely good for a party or fun brunch or dinner. If you have a larger cup you will definitely have a lot of cleavage. I don't really believe in wearing camisoles under things because I think if it's low-cut it's just supposed to be that way.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM527","Samantha","RTR Stylist Review","I love this feminine dress by Badgley Mischka! Running true to size a little stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and sizing up for the back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection hips. It works for all cup sizes and works best with a strapless bra. At 5'3', the length hit mid thigh on me. I love the colors and silhouette of this dress! Pair with nude heels to complete your outfit!","October 12, 2018","True to Size"
