"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TOM4","Kelsey","Super comfy","This top was very comfortable to wear with the adjustable waist tie. The style is perfectly retro preppy. You could probably size down if you're in between sizes and want it to be more fitted.","March 10, 2020","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AN32","Liza","I HEART THIS DRESS!","Very cute and comfortable. Even comes with a black slip to help cover up cleavage in the front.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AN32","Nicole","Great quality and eye-catching!","The dress is oversized on me but the slip is tight. There's elastic at the wrists which is a nice detail. Hook-and-eye closure at the neckline (that was near impossible for me to close!). A good quality dress but I felt like I was swimming in it so I doubt I'll rent it again.","January 14, 2020","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU61","Leanna","Liked it enough to buy!","This sweater is soft, warm and cozy. Its pretty cropped (I actually wore it with high waist leggings) but you can see just how cropped it is in this photo for reference. A large would normally be too big for me but it works for this sweater. I don't usually like sweaters but I liked this one enough to buy!","March 26, 2020","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU61","Sharlette","Cute and cozy but runs small","Loved the sweater and all the subtle colors. I only draw back was that the sleeves were really short on me. But I'm on the tall side so everyone won't have that problem.","February 17, 2020","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU61","Ryann","Runs very small","This sweater runs extremely small. I knew it was suppose to show a little stomach, but when I put it on even with high waisted jeans my entire stomach was exposed. I loved the style but I would definitely size up to a Medium if you typically wear small or XS.","January 17, 2020","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU61","Michelle","So much fun!","I really loved this sweater. It was so much fun to wear with some high-waisted skinny jeans and booties. It was also really warm so you can wear it in the winter and be comfortable. I felt so great wearing it. It accentuates all the right curves but keeps everything covered without showing any cleavage (34dd-which is saying something) so I never felt like it was inappropriate. My son is home from college and I wore it around him and he never made a comment which proves that. I love clothing that can make you feel sexy while remaining modest and this sweater does that! I was considering buying but I really only have the one outfit it would work for so I decided against it. Also, it is showing its wear. There are quite a few errant threads hanging about. It's knitted so you can easily shove them inside or, because of the almost fuzzy design of it, just smooth down and they become unnoticeable.","January 9, 2020","True to Size"

This sweater ran small but it was extremely comfortable.","The sweater ran small, it was extremely comfortable and light. It's something you can pair with a cute pair of jeans or workout pants. It's an everyday wear sweater if you want to throw something on quick. I wore it for a date night with some high wasted skinny jeans. This is definitely a must have sweater for fall and winter nights out.","December 23, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU61","Alyssa","New with tags...and a hole in the shoulder","I received this piece and it seemed brand new, tag on and all. I wore it out and had a friend embarrassingly point out that there was a large hole in the shoulder of the sweater. Unacceptable and disappointing because the top itself is SO CUTE and feels good on. Had there been no quality issue this would have been another successful RTR pick.","December 13, 2019","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU61","Hannah","Cute and comfy but size up!","Based on reviews, I ordered a size up. Glad I did. The medium was still plenty cropped with high-waisted jeans.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU61","Carla","Beautiful color and material","I was obsessed with the soft material and color, but it's a crop top that runs even smaller than you would expect. I wore high waisted jeans and still had to wear a cami underneath during a winter date night to keep warm/not expose too much stomach. I'd likely rent again, but not during freezing months.","February 5, 2020","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU61","RTR Customer","Cute top runs small","I usually wear a small in tops but this top I feel i could have actually gone with a large. It didn't stay in place (which could have been due to the fact that it was too small) and it has no stretch. I would order again in a size large.","December 22, 2019","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LOU61","Edith","A sweater bra","I only say runs small because of the length. The arms and sweater actually fit my body but this is the length of a bra on me. To be clear, I love the cropped look with high waisted jeans. I'm 5'3"" with a C cup. I got my usual size medium. It was very soft and a cute idea but wayyy too cropped if all you're looking for is a casual sweater.","December 17, 2019","Everyday"

I loved the whole idea of this dress but it was not flattering on me. I am a 0/2 and probably need an XS but only the S was available. It fit pretty well but the way the waist hit and the horizontal stripes made me look so wide. Maybe in a smaller size or maybe you need to be narrower up top (I have a pretty wide rib cage). Sadly sent it back without wearing.","March 5, 2020","True to Size"

The sides have zippers which you can open and it creates this awesome unique look. The sleeves have a thumb hole but can be used without. The colors are vibrant and pattern is pretty.

I would recommend sizing up. The faux-leather-look panels are subtle but give some interest. These are really flattering! Even being a little more snug than I'd like, these did a good amount of shaping, and everything looked a little lifted! The length was perfect for me, just past my ankles (5'2"").

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TH196","Kerri","Comfy & Cute","I'm usually a solid 10 to a large 10 - when I first put these on they fit perfectly (except the length). However, they stretched out quickly and were soon too big. Order a size down unless you like them baggy, two sizes if you like them tight. Pros: The material was comfortable. The material is thick enough to avoid creases or panty lines etc but not so thick as to feel bulky. The pattern is a tight checker white and deep red to burgundy. Looked very cute paired with either for a top. Cons: The length on my 5'8"" frame was in the no man's land of too short to be pants, too long to be cropped. They looked ridiculous with flats so I was forced to wear heels. Something to consider if you're 5'6""-5'9"". If you're really tall, they are definitely crop pants and if you're really short they could easily be pants. Also, they stretch out quickly, so order down and let them be tight while you're still at home and they will be perfect by the time you get where you're going.","December 24, 2019","Large"

I love just about any piece that manages to incorporate a super plunge v without being too scandalous, and this fit the bill perfectly. The v was super low but well-tailored, so it didn't gape or make me worry about a peekaboo moment. The sleeves have a little poof to them, but it wasn't over-the-top in real life. One of my favorite things is that the buttons down the front didn't go all they way down to the hem, so the low v was mirrored at the bottom -- kept the skirt very light and airy as well. The waist is super stretchy and flattering, too, so I'd say don't get too bogged down on sizing. So good, highly recommend.","February 15, 2020","True to Size"

My only complaint is that the hanger it came on was too wide for the sweater, and it had deformed the sweater. It looked like I had pokey little shoulder pads.

I'd say it's fairly true to size. I tend to go for size small but since it was unavailable I went for medium. It was not terribly large, but was loose in the waist and in the armpit area. I definitely could've worn it without anyone else noticing, but personally I prefer a certain fit. If you are bustier, sizing up may be a good idea but for the rest of us, stick to your usual size. I will be renting this again in a size small.","July 3, 2019","True to Size"

This is a cute everyday dress, and it worked great for my family's somewhat casual Thanksgiving meal. It wasn't too snug, and my usual XS at Madewell fit just right. This dress hit a nice length on me (5'2""), and I wasn't worried about flashing the family if I needed to bend over to get something out of the oven.

I was going to pair it with jeans but I didn’t think that it gave this gorgeous top any justice, so I pulled out these pants along with my burgundy sandals. I ordered this top in an 8 as I saw the reviews and the top looked a bit snug but I prefer loosely fitted tops. The 8 was perfect for what I was looking for in a top.

It was very loose around the shoulders/armpits (making my bra visible) as well as the waist area, where it should have been more fitted. The hem fell well below my knees and made it impossible to walk in as there is no back-slit, and I literally had to hike it up over my knees to get in and out of the car.

It fit me perfectly. It was nicely fitted in the waist and torso and had plenty of room in the busy area. I am a 36D, and often if it fits in the waist it is pretty tight in the bust. I could see that it may be a bit loose up top for someone that doesn't have broader shoulders and smaller bust.

The shoulders fit fine, but the material is super thin, and since the dress was slightly snug in my chest, you could see everything (bones, bra, etc.) so I tried to obscure it with a scarf. It also added something interesting to an otherwise pretty plain dress. Overall, I don't think there was anything special about this dress. Probably won't rent again.","July 19, 2019","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSK51","Libby","Way too long and unflattering","I was really excited for these, but didn't end up wearing them. There were just a few too many flaws that made their fit look sloppy. First, they are way too long. I'm 5'8"", and even with 2+ inch heels I would have needed to keep them pulled up as high as I can and cuff the bottoms up another 2 or more inches. Also, there are two stripes up the side of each leg. One stripe goes all the way up to the waistline. But the side stripe closer to the front cuts off at the bottom of the pockets, which eliminates any slimming effect that a stripe might otherwise have and creates the illusion that the pockets are puffing out and wider than the hips. The wash of the pockets is also significantly darker than the surrounding denim's wash, which draws more attention to the big belly effect. Aside from the length and unflattering belly area, they fit as I'd expected.","October 15, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS118","RTR Customer","True to size but short!","This dress is cut kind of wide. I'm a 12 with an hour glass figure. More often that not I have to size up with the designers here but this was roomy. Oddly enough even with the room the buttons didn't lay perfectly and if I sat down there were gaps all over. There's no zipper, the buttons are your way in and out. The straps are also very long. All of this could have been fixed with pins and fashion tape but it was so short that any slight move and my but was out. I'm 5'8 and don't normally have lengthy problems with dresses to this extent. It's comically short. It's also linen and arrived too wrinkled to wear. This will not travel well, and you'll need a steamer or iron just to wear it. Lastly, and most frustrating- the belt is the wrong size. There's no sizing on the belt, but it's super tiny, clearly a smaller dresses belt (like an 8 probably) got mixed up here. So it's not usable bc it's super tight. If you have a straight body and are a bit shorter this dress would probably fit you much better. It was nice and light, definitely a summer linen. I wish I could have worn it bc it would have been perfect for the summer festival I planned to wear it to. So I do recommend those who are either shorter than 5'7 or don't mind their booty hanging out to try it. But even those with a runway model body will need pins for the straps, fabric tape for in between the buttons and a good steamer or iron.","September 7, 2019","Everyday"

I would not have spent that much on a dress for myself, but love that the boost of confidence that wearing a well-made and designer dress gave me while having dinner at a high end restaurant for my husband's birthday. The dress definitely runs small. After recently losing 82 pounds, I'm very aware of sizing. I would normally wear a 12, but the 16 fit perfectly, especially over my ample breasts.

As another reviewer said, it fits well above the waist, but waist and hips down are tight. Size up if you've got wide hips! If I had worn my normal size, this never would've worked. From waist down, the dress is lined, but the top is unlined. This mean that my tattoo could show through the fabric, which I didn't want for work. Additionally, the front was too low to wear to work without a cami. You'll also need to wear shape wear for the dress to lay flat on you while wearing a cami and any undergarments.

There's a belt in the back that can be tightened. I'm 5'4"" and didn't mind the midi length. I've worn to work twice: once with heels and once with flats.

You can tighten the waistline using the belt buckle tassel in the back, but when I tightened it all the way the extra fabric from the buckle hung weirdly, so I safety pinned it in place. I'm 5'7"" and I generally find I have a longer torso and this dress was almost too long in the torso for me. This dress would be great on a taller lady or long waisted folks like me that are slightly tall. I would not recommend for average or petite height ladies both because of the waist and overall length which was mid-calf on me. I wore this both with a navy blazer buttoned to the top for work and more casual for dinner with the top few buttons undone down to the bustline. I thought it was cute both ways.","July 15, 2019","Work"

My first thought on looking in the mirror was ""Little House on the Prairie."" My sister's comment was it made me look like a school-marm. The fabric is nice and light (definitely a summer dress). I did like that it had small hooks in between the buttons to keep it from gaping open; that's a nice design feature. There was too much fabric in the top of the dress, which bagged down unattractively above the waist.","July 11, 2019","True to Size"

Not only is it perfect for taller gals (I'm 5'9""), it's also beautiful and fits & flows wonderfully. Sleeves are slightly tapered, but via the lining inside, so it still maintains that loose flowy appearance. Colours pop and would be great for a lot of different skin tones (warm, cool, neutral).

The colors are beautiful and vibrant. I wound up wearing this twice, and it matched with both a muted greyish dress and heels, and also with peach-colored skinnies in a different, more casual outfit. I would definitely rent this again, and am glad I was able to rent it since it's a little too pricey for me to buy. If you're shorter, this might be quite long, but was great for my 5. 7.5"" height (with heels!). The jacket is pretty light -- good for sweater weather, but I wouldn't expect it to do much in the fall. I don't recall with certainty, but don't believe it was lined.","September 25, 2019","Large"

No closure, nice sleek fit. Unlined. I consider this a slightly difficult topper, something that could almost be worn indoors but not quite and kind of not that warm for outdoors. It's for a pretty specific climate. It's still fabulous. My 3 star rating is about the color scheme - not for me. It is too warm for my cool toned hair and skin so this isn't something I'd buy or rent again.

It is very thick and if your jacket is roomy, it is perfect for a cold day or skiing. You could wear with just a vest for spring skiing. I like the pale blue color and the simple design. It isn't extremely flattering but I could have probably sized down to a small and then it would look better. However, I'm wearing it with dark jeans and it looks fine. It looks like it goes your hips on the model but it is shorter on me, more of low waist length.
