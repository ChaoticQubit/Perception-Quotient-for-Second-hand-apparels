The fit was great, and hit my waist perfectly - one pieces are hit or miss on my 5'5 high-waisted frame, but this was spot on and accentuated the right places with the elastic+ tie. The print made me so happy and is perfect for spring, it also elevated the look so that it wasn't too utilitarian (although my husband did ask me to change the oil in the car multiple times). Would totally buy this if I could!","April 9, 2020","True to Size"

Like everyone else said, the top gapes open. You can make it cover your breasts but as soon as you move, it opens. Wear a lacy bra, cami, or pin it and you won't have an issue. I am tall and have large legs/hips and this fit was flattering and comfortable. There's a slit detail in the front that isn't obvious from pictures. It stains and wrinkles easily, so not my favorite rental but it's still nice.","August 23, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC116","Connie","Get out the fashion tape!","I really wanted to like this dress. It looks great in the online photos, and looks great on the hanger. The fabric is wonderful, the cut in design are interesting. There was something about it that just didn't fit me right in the bust. Despite loading it up with fashion tape, the fabric and the tape just would not get here, and the top kept falling wide open on me. Unfortunately, I chose to wear this for the first time to a traditional church service, so it was super uncomfortable. I'm sending it back after only one wearing, even though I had hoped to use it two or three times. I'm afraid that I would constantly fret about it even if I wore it to an evening social event where more cleavage would be acceptable, I just felt like I tugged on it all the time, to the extent that even in the photo I provided it looks like I created a little crinkle in the fabric. This is a very interesting and versatile dress, and I hope this review doesn't discourage others from renting it. It might fit others just right. I received it new with tags, and I'm so sorry that it didn't work out well for me.","August 11, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC116","RTR Customer","I wanted to loved this","The design accentuated my waist in a way I found very flattering. However the v-neck was gaping, so my bra showed. The fabric didn't lay flat so it took quite a bit of maneuvering and safety pins to keep it in place and avoid flashing. Also, the material is somewhat see through, so I'd recommend nude shapewear or bike shorts underneath.","July 14, 2019","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC116","Kelsey","Cute","This dress was cute, but the fabric was different than I expected. It's a rougher fabric and wrinkles easily, which wasn't a big deal to me. I have a bigger bust (D) and kept having to adjust the dress to keep it somewhat closed, which was impossible. I had to wear a cami underneath, which took away from the cuteness of the dress. I recommend sizing up if you have a bigger bust.","March 17, 2020","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC116","Tay","stunning","I've rented this twice now in two different sizes, 2 & 4. The 2 fit and I loved the piece, but the 4 gaped a little less at the bust -- a welcome change, as that's not something I usually have to worry about at a 34B. The fabric is stretchy and hugs your upper body in such a flattering way, while also having a nice not-too-structured flow on the bottom half. One of my favorite parts is that this is a great piece for travel -- yes, it wrinkles, but I just hung the dress in the bathroom during a hot shower, gently stretched the fabric to loosen the wrinkles, and it dried/aired out perfectly ready to wear in no time flat. I wore this to work and at the beach, and am seriously fighting the urge to keep it and add it to my permanent closet. One of my top three favorite pieces I've yet rented.","February 15, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC116","Yasmin","Nice flattering cut, not nice fabric","Flattering cut of the dress, true to size, v-neck a little low, but nothing a safety pin can't fix.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC116","Sophia","Awkward","I really wanted to like this dress. The fabric is so light and comfortable, but the fit on the chest back and waste is just so confusing. The chest is too loose and frankly the dress looks awkward with a camisole. The slit in the bottom is also a little funky which is too bad because the dress does flatter your waist/ torso and backside. Overall just kind of a confusing fit I would rent if you had unlimited that way you can swap it out quickly if it doesn't work for you but definitely wouldn't spend one of my four slots if I was a regular subscriber.","September 3, 2019","Work"

Chiara Boni knows how to dress a woman, period, point blank. Im a 12/14, so ordered a 50, but will definitely downsize to a 48 next time... It still looks gorgeous, but one of the best things about Chiara is that the dress acts as SPANX- not this time.

It's a true mid rise, no stretch so they hold you in well and for those who don't have much of a booty- they fit nicely rather than flattening you out. Some reviewers said there isn't 'as much stretch as they like' - there is one what so ever. So if you're in between sizes you will want to size up. They will of course stretch out a little bit as jeans do, but there is zero actual stretch to these. Highly recommend for those with hour glass figures who have trouble with rise bc of their hips.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SMILL6","Sandy","Comfy Housedress Mood (if your chest is small enough)","I rented this with the intent to wear it at home, while still being able to be presentable for picking up mail in the lobby and opening the door to retrieve contactless deliveries. My SO asked me where I was going all dressed up when I put it on, so that's a good sign! It's a little bit too tight in the band area (there is an elastic in the back but I actually need more give in the front), which is the only part of this dress that is fitted. Consequently, my chest is constricted in the front, loose below the band, and bulging out of the sides...However, everything else about the fit is perfect. Length is short enough to be a true midi, showing just enough lower calf/ankle to be very flattering. I will wear at home, but probably would not wear in public. If my chest was a cup size or two smaller, this dress would have been nothing short of fantastic for summer.","April 28, 2020","True to Size"

I would say the fit is true to size, but the material is stretchy so I could have probably gone down a size. This is now in my regular rotation....

Looks scary at first as it is made from a stretchy, scuba type material that I thought might be a little too tight for this middle aged mom of two, but it is deceivingly forgiving fabric!

And 2) It's not very flattering to an hourglass figure because it adds bulk around the hips and there's no waist definition whatsoever.

I have slender arms, and the forearm area was still tight, even when the zippers are open. It's tightest right below the elbow. I chose to push the sleeves up over my accessories, and it gave a little more room in the shoulders and gave the arms a blousey look. You can't raise your arms very high, though. Also - make sure to knot the neck tie! It comes loose if you don't. Overall, I may rent again for an occasion (interview, etc.), but not for everyday.","January 18, 2020","True to Size"

The only drawback is that it's made of thin polyester material, and it's not lined, so although it's more of a fall/winter look you always need to wear tights/leggings to wear this.

I am a 16 in 90% of other designers and usually an 18 in Black Halo. When it came to this one, even the 18 was really snug. I would recommend going two sizes over your usual one.

After about a day of wear, they immediately broke in and are now sooo dang comfortable. Very flattering all around, but really cinch the waist without creating any sort of muffin top/pooch. I'm strictly a high-waisted gal and this isn't always the case. I've worn so many times already and they haven't lost any shape. I ended up purchasing the ones I rented, and then buying a brand new pair from AGOLDE in another wash. LOVE.","December 4, 2019","True to Size"

This is soooo not my normal style, but I decided to include it in my Update picks for a bachelorette party and then New Year's Eve in NYC. It's just the right amount of over-the-top fun with the faux fur and in-your-face star print, but it also was oddly practical. It was comfortable, warm (I didn't feel a chill until it got under 30 degrees F), and had sizable pockets. Got lots of compliments! If I could redo it, I would get just the L instead of the XL. I wanted to make sure I had the oversized look, but I ended up swimming in a LOT of jacket. I'd recommend true sizing for this one. Definitely a fun, unique piece!","January 3, 2020","True to Size"

It is also very warm and puffy. My cat thought it was another cat and kneaded it. The cons are that it doesn't really go with a lot of things in my wardrobe as the large stars design requires for this coat to stand out, so the rest of the outfit needs to be a bit subdued to not over-do it. Overall I liked this coat, best suited for colder climates.","December 9, 2019","Everyday"

These are high waisted, ending right above my belly button. Don't bag out at all, no matter how many times worn. Has SOME stretch. If you're typically the same size no matter the brand/stretch of a jean, then order your true size. If you are even slightly between sizes, I would size up. Usually a 12 so I ordered 31r & they were uncomfortably snug. Tried 32r (technically size 14) & they fit PERFECT! Length was also perfect, not too long or too short.","January 20, 2020","Everyday"

I wear it for work or play honestly. They're Levi's so it speaks to the quality and the versatility. My skin can be sensitive to some fabric but this wasn't irritable at all.

Inside is meticulously lined with a breathable fabric that's slick for comfort, acts as a substitute for a slip. This is my ""go to"" power suit lately.","April 5, 2020","Small"

The material is thick high quality and true scuba material that hugs your body in all the right places but still hides flaws. It is a great choice for fall as it's a thicker fabric worth 3/4 length sleeves. I paired it with a black jacket for work. It came slightly below my knees in flats which was perfect for my style but taller ladies may find it too short for work. I sized up, I am normally a 12 but got a 14 based on the recommendations of others and it fit me like a glove. I would recommend sizing up. The little ruffle at the waist is great for hiding your stomach if it's a problem area for you. I wore a cami under it as it was a bit low cut for work but for going out it would be fine.

I rented them in the summer so will be sending back after one wear (in AC all day) but will definitely rent again in the fall. They fit true to size, however the front rise (front seam) is very flat so they create a bit of a camel-youknow if you have curvy thighs. So I would only wear a longer shirt that covered it.

The medium was still too large in the waist and these are meant to be worn high waisted so they kept slipping down. All that extra fabric in the crotch was not attractive.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RB62","Lisa e","Cute but weird fit","These are true track pants, in that they are a stretchy/neoprene sort of material, but because of the print and the fit they can be dressed up as regular pants in most environments. Very cool, very comfortable, although the fit was a bit off for my body. I am a typical thin pear-shape, and the XS felt true to size in most aspects but was quite tight in the lower hip/upper thigh area. The pants are not high waisted (more of a mid to low rise) and the waist as well as the first 4-5 inches of the pants were plenty big, and if I went up to a Small I’m pretty sure that part would be way too big. Because the pants are stretchy (not super stretchy though) it was not a problem, but it was just kind of a weird place for them to be tight and if you are wider in the hips or have a booty, you may want to size up although beware that if your waist is small the top part may be big. If you have more of a straight or narrow-hipped body, these pants will probably fit great. The length on these is pretty long - I’m 5’6” and they were slightly long on me, although you can unzip the leg to avoid them pooling or scrunching around your ankles. If you are petite, they may be a bit long, although they do look very chic with a heel.","April 4, 2019","Everyday"

There is ribbed, stretchy fabric along the underside of the arms (which makes the jacket more comfortable than your usual leather jacket).

I generally wear a size 8, but I have wide shoulders for my waist size and knew there wouldn't be any stretch in this material. The 10 fit me well in the shoulders but was definitely big in the waist, so I ended up safety pinning it on each side to bring it in a little. The ruffles and flow made the pinning easy to hide.","November 7, 2019","Work"

I received multiple compliments and was really comfortable wearing it all day at work. The light flow material was cool in the summer heat when outdoors, but kept me warm enough in an air-conditioned office. I was nervous that the 8 would be tight under my armpits but it was the perfect fit. The sleeves were the dress highlight.

The dress is a synthetic material. It was a bit staticky. I got a lot of compliments on the dress. It was almost to my knees (I am 5'11"") and the sleeves were 3/4 length. It is zip-up in the back and has a clasp at the top. The elastic in waist hit a a good spot on me. It was a very comfortable dress in a way that you just forget you are wearing it. I didn't have to adjust it or pull it down. Loved it. Another KS winner.","April 25, 2019","Everyday"

Size: I have a large chest, 34DD, and it fit perfectly, but do know the front opening is low & cleavage will show. You might want a bralette underneath.
