"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMO1","Cheryl lynn6","PERFECT LITTLE BLACK CROPPED JEANS","These are super cute and fun to wear. The denim is slightly heavy and some structured than most. As others mentioned, the little ties can be tricky to get right. When they show up in bag the ties are all folded in. I pre-tied them, used my steamer and got them nice and flat so they showed up. I thought they might pinch back in to nothing as I wore them, but they stayed at attention the whole time I had them on. I am wearing the RTR Nanette Lepore black silk wrap top with it in photo and got soooo many compliments on the outfit. I am a jeans size 28 but got the 27 based on looking at reviews from others my size/weight and I'm so glad I did, they fit perfectly.","July 12, 2019","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMO1","Amy","Upgrade from Basic","These are black jeans, but the little tie at the ankle elevates them just a bit. Pretty thick denim with not a ton of stretch. Like regular denim, they will loosen out with wear. These are more low rise, not super low but definitely below the waist. I liked them a lot, will probably rent again.","May 13, 2019","True to Size"

I usually wear a 6 in a skirt and occasionally an 8 but usually 8 is too big in the waist but good for tighter skirts in the hips. The waist was so tiny in this. I could get it on, but it was very uncomfortable. I wanted to take it off almost immediately. Furthermore, the material is paper thin and unlined. This is not a winter skirt. It also felt much cheaper then it was. The pleats are not as firm as I'd like. I also think it's the first time I've seen a non-pencil skirt that can give panty lines. I didn't like the way it lay at all. It was not flattering. This one is going back without wearing it. I feel like it would work better for someone without hips and a super tiny waist.

You can really change up the look depending on what shirt you pair under it. I wear a six or eight in dresses. I ordered the eight and it barely fit in the chest, rib cage. There is no give, so if in doubt, size up. The hip area has plenty of room and is flowy. I did feel that because of the pockets it makes you look wider in this area. Since it was fitted in the waist, this didn't bother me. The material is lined and thick and warm. It's polyester, but still feels expensive. The length below the knees makes it feel more conservative and work appropriate. I liked it well enough, but it didn't stand out for me like some other pieces I've rented.","March 13, 2019","Work"

Soft, quality, mid-weight fabric that's just slightly thick enough to keep me warm on breezy spring/fall days. The pattern is more buffalo check than gingham and it definitely feels like a city coat. I didn't spot the pearl embellishments on the sleeves until I opened the RTR bag and thought I'd hate them, but they are subtle enough just to add interest. You can dress this up or down and it's a good one for shorter girls who want to try the oversized coat trend without looking like they're drowning in fabric.","March 20, 2019","Large"

It was a little on the short side for work, but still wearable (I'm 5'11""). I didn't find it very comfortable, though. It's not breathable, the sleeves were a tad short, and the neckline hit at an uncomfortable place. I wore this in around 55 degree weather and on the one hand felt sweaty up top but also wished I'd worn tights. I certainly wouldn't want to wear it in much warmer weather.","April 4, 2019","Work"

The style is definitely more of a straight shift, so there isn't a ton of shape anyway. The length was great for work and didn't ride up when I sat down, thankfully.

I like things to be big on me so I usually size up for sweaters like this.

I didn't think it was itchy and just wore a long camisol underneath. I typically wear a medium and it fit without looking huge, but i think a small would've been better. I wore with leggings and the M was plenty long to cover my butt while wearing leggings, but I think the small probably would have too. I liked the wide sleeves and boxy look for everyday wear. I wore it on a 10 degree day without a coat for going in and out of the office and I was plenty warm. And the weather would likely be too thick to fit under a coat.

While the fabric was comfy, it got a little saggy with wear and while I felt like I was wearing something new, it didn't feel special. There is a Tory Burch Sport top on RTR that has a similar cut and style but the fabric feels much higher quality and the colors are more vibrant.

I felt like it ran a big big, especially in the chest and arms area, but I am almost 5'8 and liked the length. It's boxy so it felt important to have a slim bottom with skinny jeans and the same colored shoes so that it created a clean, slim line. I could see wearing this open over a black dress with heels for a work meeting or presentation. It was fun and definitely a statement piece. The last thing that I didn't like was the name of the designer on the back of the blazer - just felt tacky to me. This isn't Juicy!","February 21, 2020","Large"

Wore it to work (as pictured) with a skirt, then wore it on the weekend with white jeans. Beware: the top is VERY straight fit, so depending on how wide your hips are it may be slightly snug. I side-tucked it so it was NBD, but it looked a little odd/unflattering if I wore it untucked due to the bottom fitting tighter than the loose chest.

I really liked the pleating, and the blue/black color is versatile. I would note that they are unlined and given the thin material, did tend to wrinkle over the course of the day. The side zip closure was also prone to sticking at the waistband. My main hang up at the end of the day is that they are somewhat restricted from a style perspective, which isn't ideal for a work pant. Given the wide leg and pleating on the hips, I found that they were only flattering when worn with a pretty closely tailored top and stilettos, and pinstripes don't go with everything. As a result, they sat in my closet awhile before I wore them. I may rent again when I want to wear these specific pants with something, but I did not find them to be the type of rental you rotate through your regular work wardrobe.","February 14, 2019","Work"

Like others have mentioned, the dress is extremely tight across the chest, so I was unable to wear a bra with it. Because of the thick fabric, I didn't really need one, but that did mean that the tag in the back of the dress was very itchy.

Beautiful colors, rich embroidery and a flattering fit made it my favorite dress on vacation. Perfect for dinner at a nice resort. As other reviewers have mentioned, the straps are an unusual length that create a bit of a dilemma for large breasts. I had to decide whether to put my DDD cleavage over or under the top of the dress. I opted for a push-up strapless bra that pushed the girls slightly over the top. Without a bra, my breasts were completely covered and secure, creating a peasant-style fit that was more casual and still pretty.","February 19, 2019","Vacation"

Unfortunately, others have mentioned the fit on top is very weird. You can't really wear a bra - even a strapless one, because of how the bodice is. I don't have a large chest so went braless but the look is strange on top. The shoulder straps we're also too long on 5'3"" me, so I had to wear a sweater on top to cover up. Maybe a smaller size wouldn't have had the strap issue - I went a size up from what I normally wear pre-pregnancy.","January 9, 2019","Vacation"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TYB47","Christine","""Little flower girl on a commune."" Dress runs true to size. Beautiful fabric.","I ended up not wearing this dress because it wasn't flattering on me and looked like a mumu. My husband commented that I looked like a ""little flower girl living in a commune."" The fabric is gorgeous and I love the orange color. I usually wear size 10 in RTR tops (5'8"", 155 lbs, 36C) and this dress in size 10 fit perfectly at the chest (which is the only place where it is fitted). It needs to be worn without a bra or with a strapless bra. Since the dress fits tight around the chest area (which is a good thing if going bra-less), it definitely flattens the chest like pancakes. Would be more comfortable if the chest band had some elastic in it. The straps are a bit long and are not adjustable, so they will likely fall off the shoulders a lot. If you like this style of dress, I recommend you give it a try. For me, I need a little bit more shape.","June 29, 2018","True to Size"

The wait fit me, though, so if I'd sized up I'd have needed a belt (I am curvy). I styled them with blank ankle boots, a neutral solid top, and a denim jacket. As you can see I also added the Joanna Laura Constantine Grommet Rainbow Earrings for a bit of dazzle. These are great for dress down Fridays and being out and about in the city on a weekend.

The fabric is buttery soft and I wanted to live in them... only I could not get them on all the way. Total bummer.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF159","Andrea","Amazing color","So I really liked this dress even though there were a few things about it that you should know before it gets there. I have larger breasts, 32DDDD, and it fit fine over them but it definitely showed way too much bra. So have fashion tape handy or a couple of safety pins. Barely noticeable but you do end up showing a good amount of cleavage so if it's not that kind of party and you have a large cup size, rethink it ! Otherwise I'm sure it fits smaller breasts beautifully. Also the dress does fall nicely on the curves but because of that it accentuates some of the not so nice curves. Highly recommend with a good pair of spanx to tighten things up and it looks woooonderful. I am short so the sleeves were longer but honestly it's just part of being short. Other than that I loved the heavier feel of the material, it doesn't wrinkle, moves along with your body, the color and dress length !","October 18, 2017","Formal Affair"

The dress runs true to size, but the fabric is super giving and stretchy, so the dress is made to hug your curves. It’s comfortable in the bust area, and any cup size would look great in this. Wrap dresses can be pulled off by literally anyone, so it is appropriate for any body type. I’m a normal size 6, so the medium fit like a glove; the fabric is really comfortable and soft. The mauve color adds a unique flare to the dress; it’s not your average day color so it can be worn to a casual work event, or a simple cocktail party or a brunch. Nude or black heels would do the trick, or even white tennis shoes. Either way, this dress is really classy for any occasion.","August 23, 2017","True to Size"

Length was perfect, no bra exposed at armholes. I styled as shown and put a big faux fur green coat over it in NY! In SF I styled this dress with a denim jacket and neon yellow heels and clutch.","March 31, 2019","Other"

I do feel a little like wife of Green Lantern and so I would say it's definitely a statement dress, a little theatric if you are trying to make a strong impression. it could however be toned down, I feel like a jacket would break up the dramatic green pattern -- but then why bother.

The sleeves seem like they should be longer and it was shorter than I think it should be but I have a long torso. I perhaps would have preferred to size up to a size S but it was already bubbling out in the back by my armpit/shoulder blade so that probably would've been worse in a bigger size. Not sure if mine has been shrunken or is normal for the XS.

This could just be my experience, but I felt I should share. Also, I was returning from vacation and felt like a beached whale, so I ordered up two sizes.

This is a very warm, fluffy, thick jacket. It might overwhelm a smaller framed person. The only problem I had was not with the jacket, but with the cleaning.

One thing to note - you can see my bra through the fabric. Not too bad and still appropriate for work and most white button down shirts do that but just be aware of it.","April 14, 2018","Work"
