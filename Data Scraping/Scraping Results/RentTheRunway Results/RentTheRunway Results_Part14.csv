I was NOT wrong, from the moment I arrived until I left, everyone (yes, even that friend) told me how good I looked. It hid all my problem spots (arms, tumtum), I didn't have to worry about tugging on any parts, it was easy to put on and exactly what I needed.

I'm short-waisted and busty with a pretty small waist and I thought the proportions were great on me- the length hit about 2 inches below my hips and the bottom was fitted enough to balance out the slightly oversized top. The colors and pattern make this seem a bit delicate - it is definitely conservative enough for my office.

Perhaps I'm too short for the make of the dress, but it's overly blousy in the chest and waist making for an unflattering fit-so I popped a black blazer over it and it was acceptable enough to wear, visually brining in the top. A nice idea, but not right for me/a petite frame. Perhaps great if you are super busty, but otherwise unflattering.","February 23, 2020","Work"

The material wasn't what I was expecting as I believe it's made from recycled materials. It almost feels a bit plastic-ish instead of the silk feeling I assumed from the picture. The top also lays a bit funky if you have a larger chest. The material also pleats during shipping so if you have time, steam it before you wear it. I didn't have time to steam it and thus had a weird crease over my boob for the day. Which, is user error not the dresses fault. Otherwise, the dress hits at a really nice length (mine hit below my knees because of my height) and was totally appropriate for work.","January 23, 2020","True to Size"

The pattern isn't remarkable, but the black and white meshes nicely with my core work pieces, and the color blocking (black on the bottom) is another little detail that makes it different from a plain patterns blouse.

I only wore it once and wouldn't rent it again but that is just because I don't feel like leather is my thing. It was very comfortable to wear, though, and the material is very soft. I do feel like it runs big. I am a solid size 6 and I could have easily worn the 4. The elastic band makes this a very comfortable fit but is thick so I felt that a shirt that would hang over without covering up the detail of the draping was essential. Now maybe if I had gotten the 4, that would have helped with the issue of the band being so prominent but I am not sure on that. Plus, the shirt looked great with the skirt so no big deal!","January 9, 2020","Large"

But I thought that a looser fit might be more comfortable for something high-waisted. While it was comfortable, it was slightly awkward to style because my tights sat higher on my hips than the skirt, creating weird lines on my sweater where it kept getting stuck in the gap (because the skirt had a 2"" gap from my waist). I'd rent it again, but will wait for a 2 or 0 to be available!","December 10, 2019","Everyday"

They're a bit long so might be hard to wear without high heels if the person is on the shorter side (I'm 5'5"" and felt I had to wear heels).

I'm able to wear them cuffed with high heels, and they look great, but just aren't that practical for me. The material makes these more work appropriate than I thought they would be, so I'd say if you're tall and work in a business-casual office, these would be perfect.

There are unfortunately 2 fatal flaws: the tiny snap button that holds the top closed at the bust (the same tiny snap at the back of a dress/top of zipper), and the complete lack of any other way to keep it closed. There is a strong chance you will expose yourself unexpectedly if you hold your arms out wide, raise your arm, or generally move about.

I rented this to use for a saint patty's day fundraiser this weekend but it's honestly so well made and pretty that I'm planning to use it every day. It is smaller so u can't fit a wallet but it fits my cards, key fob, and I phone no problem.","March 5, 2020",""

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/WVG131","Heather","Lining was longer than the skirt so I could not wear this.","If this had been made correctly, I would have loved it. I couldn't wear it because 1/2 inch of the lining hung below the skirt.","March 18, 2020","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/WVG131","Traci","ran very small..it was short. The lining was longer than the outer layer...","I think the outer layer of the skirt shrunk because the lining stuck out 1/2 and inch from the bottom of the skirt. I loved it...and wish it would have fit me.","March 10, 2020","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/WVG131","Irene","Too short for work","Way too short for work, and the lining beneath the skirt was long and would show underneath the skirt. Still wore it over the weekend for brunch though, and was cute.","February 29, 2020","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/WVG131","Brooke","Another hawt plaid mini from RTR!","I have been really enjoying all the plaid skirts RTR has to offer this winter and this is another gem. The material is a little bit on the bulky side so prepare to wear with a slim fit top and tights. The fit/fabric didn't deter me from wearing but it was definitely more of a chunky boucle than a tightly woven plaid. Color is cute too and b/c it's not Christmas-y or school-girl colors it doesn't look juvenile.","February 18, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PR128","Lynda","LOVE this peice!","Comfy, airy, flashy but flexible. I wore something underneath most of the time but didn't need to. I would 100% buy this if it weren't so crazy expensive! Great for everyday or date style events!","February 26, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PR128","Tammy","Statement piece","From a day in the office to a night on broadway. This blouse is super sleek and special. I had to pin the scarf element to the back of the shirt to make it stay in place. I also added a thin blue belt to cinch the waist, but I had fun wearing this garment. Recommended!","February 15, 2020","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PR128","Jennifer","High fashion but too branded for my taste","I didn't end up wearing this; loved the draping in the photo, and it was lovely in person as well. What wasn't apparent to me from photo is that the designer name is printed on the shirt. I get it's a thing, but not my thing. That combined with the lightweight material and short sleeves meant I passed on wearing.","February 25, 2020","Work"
