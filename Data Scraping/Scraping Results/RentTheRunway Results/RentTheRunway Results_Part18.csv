"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RRY75","Alison","Cozy","I think you could size down in this - it was a little more oversized on me than on the model. Heavier weight material, so I think this would be pretty warm, and there's definitely room for a layer. I didn't wind up wearing it but I'd consider it again when it's colder.","April 1, 2020","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RRY75","Colleen","Super comfy, so versatile","I rented this sweater for a trip to Europe in mid-December. It was so comfortable and fit me perfectly (sometimes I have problem with length due to being 5'10). I then wore the sweater to work and for Christmas dinner before returning it. Very tempted to buy it, although I ultimately didn't. One of my favorite rentals!","December 27, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RRY75","Terri","Cute work sweater","I wore to work. It felt soft in comparison to other sweaters. I was comfortable in a M but I could have sized down.

I have a large rib cage and small bust. Did not need to wear a bra! Wore to dinner date in Maui and was very comfortable, even in the heat. Great quality, adjustable straps, buttons are functional and reinforced with hidden snaps which was a bonus. Great rental!","January 26, 2020","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Brooke","Runs small; cute but not the most flattering","Cute dress, but runs small so size up. The material isn't flexible, so if you have a bust, be prepared for the snaps to unsnap constantly (don't worry, it'll still stay closed with the buttons). Didn't love where it hit me on the leg, as it wasn't the most flattering, but still cute.","January 4, 2020","Vacation"

Lots of reviews mention the fabric being wrinkly-- it's linen, so that's to be expected. I didn't find it to be an issue. The print is super cute. It was comfortable and breathable for vacation in the keys. Loved it","December 11, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Melissa","Fun print","Rented this for a party and it was very comfortable linen material. Dress was just the right length, not too short. I had to pin in the underarm because the bust was too big but skirt fit great!","November 7, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Emily","Runs small...like two sizes small.","The buttons have supporting snaps to help things stay out, but they wouldn't stay closed it was so tight.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Emily","So so cute but wrinkles when you breathe!","This dress just like everyone has said is adorable!! I sized up per reviews and it really did fit perfect for me in a size 6 (I'm between a 4/6) I didn't wear a bra and felt comfortable as the straps are adjustable. My 34b/c chest fit with some room to spare. The waist and hip room was perfect felt fitted but not tight I have about 28 inch waist and 36 inch hips. The cut out was petite and perfectly placed on trend. I will take this on vacation in Arizona and I think it will be good in the very hot weather as I wore it today in about 85 degrees and felt good. Literally the only con is that it wrinkled as soon as I stepped into it, after steaming it even. It's cute how it buttons but also snaps for extra secureness. The wrinkles almost looked like they went with the dress so it ended up not being too bad to me. I'm glad I have this all month I will get lots of use out of it! I paired it with a nude pair of wedge sandals. Hubby loves it.","July 27, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","RTR Customer","Summer Outdoor Party","I wore this dress to an outdoor event in 100 degree weather. The linen material was perfect, although wrinkly. My particular dress arrived a bit wrinkly, too. I am usually a 6, and ordered the 8 as a backup. It did not come, and while I could wear the 6, I might have preferred the 8. It did stretch a bit as the day progressed. It has little silver clasps in between the buttons, but mine kept coming unsnapped. Overall a great dress with a fun pattern and flattering.","July 17, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Jessica","Cute but size up!","Rented for a girl's weekend and got lots of compliments from strangers. There are POCKETS! It's held together with little snaps to supplement the buttons and even though it was NWT when I got it, a snap right below the boob area popped off. I don't know how this will hold up to wear and tear. Definitely size up - I'm usually an 8-12 but the 14 was tight and short!","July 11, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Kelly","Loved it","Summer perfection. Husband didn't like the color with my untanned skin so I sent it back but will be renting it when it pops up again. Love the fresh print and linen fabric.","July 11, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Jaclynn","The most fun dress","This dress was great but I would say you have to size up. I wear between a 6&8 and I loved this dress enough that I would rent again but in a 10. It was beautiful standing up but when I sat down it puckered too much. The colors are beautiful and fun.","July 8, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Maya","Just okay - amazing pattern but tight fit!","This dress is so pretty but it runs small - couldn't wear a bra with it either. The buttons kept popping open especially around the chest area. The pattern was soooo pretty but the fit was meh!","July 6, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Melissa","Orange ya glad to see this dress?","Cute but wrinkly material. I loved the orange print! It fit well but I couldn't wear bra. It was too tight with bra. No give to the fabric at all. I may have been happier with a 6 for this one.","July 2, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Christina","Perfect vacay dress - size up!","Loved everything about this dress - the pattern, the center cutout, the fabric, the length were all perfect. HOWEVER, it definitely runs small. I'm between 4/6 and the 6 was snug, especially after a vacation feast. It has adjustable straps and extra snaps to keep it in place, and easy to wear a normal strapless bra with. Overall highly recommend with one size up!","June 27, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Melissa","Flirty summer dress","I liked the light fabric, bright colors, and the snaps between the buttons were a game changer. I wasn't worried about busting out or flashing anyone. It does run very small so I sized two sizes up based on reviews. I probably somewhere between sizes but didn't mind the extra room.","June 21, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","RTR Customer","So fun!","I got tons of compliments on this dress. The pattern is so fun and perfect for summer. I wore it for a day party. It fits true to size for the most part, but buttons were a little stretched on the chest and bottom area if you are a curvier shape. But still fit and loosened up a bit as you wear it. Overall really really cute and will rent again for another vacation!","June 17, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Emily","Summer fun!","Very charming print and and cut. The gap under the bust is pretty tame. The buttons also have little snaps in between which kept it from gapping, so handy!!","June 1, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Kathryn","Adorable!!!","I wore this on vacation! It's a linen material so it's light weight and comfortable.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Jackie","Perfect for hosting a brunch","Fits really well. Has little metal buttons to secure the buttons you see in the center of the dress. Linen so it'll get wrinkled but the print distracts from that. Perfect dress for brunch that could transition into a night of fun NYC style!","May 23, 2019","Party"

I just had a different look in mind. Cute dress, perhaps better for a more tomboy figure and less than a curvy figure.","December 1, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Tracey","Cute, short, summery","Flattering dress with a happy, cute print. It's very short (like too short to bend over more than a little). That said it was super cute to wear on a casual day.","November 4, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Chris","Not for large chest","It fit well in my waist and hips but It was a little tight where the little clasp at the top wouldn't stick. I am a 34DD. I am usually a 4/6 in clothes. The 6 fit","October 11, 2019","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Laura","Too small","Love the dress, but I couldn't even button it up all the way because it was probably two sizes too small. I will be ordering it in a larger size!","September 12, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK358","Amber","Super cute print, but a bit on the small side.","I normally wear a 4-6, but ordered an 8 based on the reviews and I'm glad I did. It fit like a glove. I possibly could have even gone to a size 10 for some breathing room (I have a very wide rib cage). I liked the hidden snaps around the bust and waist that helped keep the fabric closed around the buttons, though I felt it could have used an additional snap around the hip area (it gaped when I sat down). Overall, it's a super cute summer dress but you MUST order a size (or two) up!","September 9, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TH200","Caitlin","Fun pants for a night out in Vegas, but some fit issues","These pants have a satin finish and were just what I wanted for a night out in Vegas. The pants were fitted, which I liked, but they also tended to slide down a bit and I had to keep hiking them up at the waist. When they did start to slide down, then they would get bunched up a bit at the ankles. Apart from those issues, the pants worked for my purpose. I think they definitely look best with heels and I wore a thong to avoid panty lines.","January 1, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TH200","Lisa","Great pants!","I sized up because theory always seems to run a little snug. Should have stuck with the 10. I loved them. Great with heels.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TH200","Alison","These are satin pants that fit like cigarette trousers.","I didn't know when I ordered them that they were going to be so shiny, but once I put them on with a long sweater over them I fell in love. Very cute, but warning: the material is thin so if you have any bumps and bulges, they will show. It might be possible to wear spanx underneath but I never got around to that.","January 19, 2020","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TH200","Elissa","Shiny satin","These pants surprised me. They were shiny satin which I hadn't realized.

The knit is really pretty close up and comprised of a variety of subtle colors. It is very soft and comfortable and definitely warm. I am petite so did not find the cut to be too short, though it is boxy (see pic), but I liked it. Looked great with jeans!

It's your RTR dream - something I'd never purchase in a store, otherwise would never wear, received a million compliments and now wish I owned it! The sweater is a crop top. It hit me right at the waist line of my higher waisted jeans. I wore a navy tank under it so that when I lifted my arms you didn't see my stomach.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF260","Adora","Flashier than I anticipated","I knew this would be a busy knit sweater with lots of prints, but what I wasn't expecting is that the pattern detail would be glittery. I like the sort of menswear/tie pattern vibe the prints in this sweater are giving off, but the glittery-ness of it, I think, cheapens it a bit. It may be to someone else's taste to have it like that though, but it was too much for me between the print and the glitter. In addition the cut of the sweater is such that if your stomach isn't totally flat, the band of the sweater will sort of ride up and hang under your pooch and emphasize it. It doesn't help that the bottom band is this eye-searing glittery baby blue and red so it really draws your eye to that area. I wore it once and am promptly sending it back.","January 3, 2019","True to Size"

I had to get them over my ankle, pull the leg warmer part up my shins, and then shimmy-jump them all the way up. But this kept me looking pretty trim in them.

The dress has buttons all the way down the front.

The small likely would've fit the same in the torso, but the length would've helped the fit of the shoulders.

I usually wear a M or L depending on the brand, but the XLR was the only size available, so I took a chance. They were definitely big on me, but not in a saggy or droopy way. They were soooo comfy. And the ultra wide waistband is thick and sort of padded (but not in a bulky way)...it kind of holds you in and smoothes things out. I also loved the bold colors of the pattern and the ""realisitic fur"" look of the print. I considered buying these, but I already own waaaay too many pairs of leggings so I resisted.

No untying or strange wiggling require to pull it down and back up! Cons: Requires someone to tie it, if you want the tie in a certain place.

I wore it on the weekend with high-waist blue jeans and it was warm and comfortable and made for a very polished casual look. But I wasn't really able to style it in a way I loved especially with dressier clothes for work - I had hoped it might fit more like a shirt and be able to be tucked into pants/skirts and it was too loose and a bit too bulky for that. But it also wasn't an oversized fit so I just felt a little preppy and suburban, despite the edgy sleeve and back details.","April 10, 2018","Everyday"

The fabric seems to be a kind of faux leather with a foam backing. I started to try it on just enough to confirm that I didn't like the way the top was draping or the feel of the fabric. I decided to return it unworn and exchange for another item. I'm not sure of the overall fit because I didn't finish trying it on. I listed 'True to Size' since I am not sure.

The inside of the material is attractive and soft feeling, a nice faux suede. I used this as a sort of sweater one day and was able to throw it in my bag and the wrinkles fell out when I hung it up again. Fit was barely too small. If you normally wear a 12 and are busty think about sizing up to XL. I made it work but needed to wear a minimizer bra.","October 11, 2019","Small"

For busty gals, the ""cups"" of the breast part of the jumpsuit will be too small but the material is forgiving and the pattern makes it hard to see the seams (you can see this if you zoom in on the chest in my photo).

The material felt very high quality - it didn't feel cheap. The fit in the chest runs on the ever-so-slightly small side, so while the 6 worked fine and I loved wearing it, I'd try for an 8 the next time since it's meant to be an easy breezy fit. The length hit just at or slightly-above the hip (and I have a short torso); this made it feel a smidge shorter than I would have preferred in the perfect world.

The reason for the review is I didn't see anyone mention the bust size. I have a shorter torso, with a larger chest, and I *barely* fit in the size small, and would have had to use a safety pin to not have it show a ton of cleavage. Even then, it was tight. I would have sized up to a medium if I was to want to comfortably wear this dress. If you have a larger chest, size up. It was such a pretty print, but suggested a slight formality with the length of the dress and sleeves so I chose another dress by the same brand. Overall a beautiful dress, but unless you're rail thin with a small chest, be careful with sizing.","September 24, 2019","True to Size"

I wore a coral top to pick up on that color. It was long on me (I'm 5'4""), which seems to be the norm with DVF skirts and dresses I've tried to date. They seem to be designed with tall people in mind. It was close fitting, with a vent in back so walking was no problem.

I'd consider it work appropriate, I wore it with black tights and a black top. Hits me about 4"" above the knee though so maybe depends on your work. The shiny Lurex part is not too much.

It does run small - I went up a size (from a 4 to a 6) and it still looks very tight across my body (I have a big butt, but a flat stomach); on the other hand, the sleeves are comfortable and maybe a little loose on the size up (and I have muscular arms).

The fabric is like thick crepe. It is pretty low cut so you might need to pin it together or size appropriately- I think this would fit better on someone with a little more bust to fill it out.

I thought they were as flattering as they were comfortable. Because of the thin white check they were easy to match with light colors and dark.

Pros: It's a super versatile piece and packs easily. Felt comfortable and casual but not out of place at the party. Pretty easy to get off and on to pee! Washed and ironed easily. The buttons were my favorite part. Cons: leg length was very long on me, I had to pin the length up for every wear except with ~3"" heels. It is linen, so don't expect a perfectly crisp piece, it's best for casual events. The chest was large and low, I was super conscious when dancing that it gaped open a good amount.","August 8, 2019","Party"

The drawstring waist is weird because if you want to use it to add definition to your waist the ties being in the back prove a challenge. I wore to work so not only do you have the stress of basically undressing to use the bathroom but add in that you have to Houdini yourself to untie then retie the drawstring. Not practical for most women In my opinion. Furthermore, one of the buttons fell off as I waited for the bus on my way home.

It was kind of difficult to shimmy in and out of since it was actually the right size for me (that's just a structural flaw), so I wouldn't recommend wearing it on a night out. It's also very long, so I had to roll up the legs, and I'd say I'm a decent height. Lastly, no one mentioned it but this thing is SHEER. Pair it with some nude Jockey Skimmies and wear the right bra.

The only issue was that it pulled in my chest. I was recommended to get an L which is my normal size but I probably needed an XL. So if you are larger on top I would size up.","April 17, 2020","Small"

The XL was the only one available- I would rent again in the L or even M. I got a ton of compliments every time I wore it!","January 16, 2020","Everyday"

I broke my elbow and was stuck in a splint that went from my shoulder to my wrist for 12 weeks. The first 4 weeks were spent with this jacket as a staple of my wardrobe. This jacket was perfect for draping over the arm with the splint and wearing normally on the other side. It was also but enough to fit my arm with my splint on if I needed to button it up for warmth. TBH I'm very thankful for this jacket. It made those few weeks bearable","December 28, 2019","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PEN4","Aj","I couldn't fall in love.","Unfortunately, the jacket definitely runs a whole size large, so I was not able to fall in love with the way it looked on my body. As you can see from the picture, it definitely has an oversized fit to it with the drop shoulders and wider frame of the denim. I put it on a few times with the intention of making it work with my outfit but just could not figure it out so I didn't end up wearing it at all.","September 15, 2019","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PEN4","Lauren","SWEATSHIRT LIKE COMFY, CUTE JACKET","I wore this jacket easily 3-4 times a week during the entire month I had it. It is amazingly comfortable! The sleeves are a sweatshirt material which made it so comfy while the rest of the jacket is denim so it was stylish. I wore this jacket with leggings, joggers, and shorts as a casual, everyday look to class and also dressed it up more with an athletic skirt and black jeans one day. Even my roommates loved this jacket and wore it on days when I didn't. I rented a size medium and it was for sure an over sized fit. I will 100% rent again but in a size small. Such a great rental!!!!","March 10, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PEN4","Lauren","Great casual jacket!","I loved this jacket! Wore it a ton. Finally decided to swap it out, but if it's available I will rent again. Looked great with the Monroe grey and black tiger strip sweats as well as with black leggings. It is big, I probably could have worn the small, but it's supposed to be boxy and big. It's really cozy and the perfect go to for fall weekends.","November 8, 2019","Large"

I got a large, which is bigger than my normal size, because I thought I'd need more room for big sweaters. I was wrong. It's already a larger fit so definitely keep to your true size.","November 2, 2019","Everyday"
