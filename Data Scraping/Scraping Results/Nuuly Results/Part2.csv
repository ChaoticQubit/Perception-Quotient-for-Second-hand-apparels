I've been gravitating towards brightly colored clothes to lift my mood during Oregon's stay at home order. This dress makes it easy. It's flowy, a little textured with the tiering, made of quality fabric, and bright neon green but with a little fading, which makes it's color a little less overpowering. As for fit, it's pretty true to size but runs small in the chest. I wore at home without a bra and in public with a supportive swim top and a small was just a teensy bit tight.","13-May-2020"
