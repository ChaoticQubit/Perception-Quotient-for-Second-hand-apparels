Got lots of compliments and it was very comfortable. Super flattering even if you are self-conscious about your arms/armpits. It runs *slightly* large, but not enough to make me rank it as that, just a bit. I also have a large chest, and it didn't look like a tent which most flouncy tops do. Rent this! I bought it :)","25-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/irongirl-jacket?color=001","Jessanne","LOVE THIS","This jacket was the COOLEST. I work in a company where you can wear jeans to work, and this was completely acceptable to wear. Material is like a stretchy fabric, and its super lightweight. I would totally recommend this!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/irongirl-jacket?color=001","Itinerantd","Too shiny for work","It’s almost glittery, more than the sheen in the photo - more for night out, very thin, unlined and raw edges faux suede, very staticky and the drape in the front shows a lot of the underside of the fabric, not like the photo. On top of that the shoulders of my usual size were tight.","15-Feb-2020"

It's fun, colorful, and I had a great time wearing out a few nights, but I probably wouldn't want to buy it because I don't know how much repeat wear I would get out of it. Feels like a rainbow teddy bear giving you a hug. Fit well on me.","18-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-pop-jacket?color=000","BijouLaurent","Love the colors and overall look","The arms are a little short but it works and I’ve been wearing it over virtually anything (overalls, dresses). Also, you can dress it up or down. It’s perfection.","10-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-pop-jacket?color=000","Denago","Super fun but not super practical","I felt so fun in this jacket - an instant mood booster.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/uo-diane-paperbag-wide-leg-pant?color=041","Jenx","Too tight in waist","The reviews said these pants ran small, so I sized up, but they were still too tight to be comfortable. I'm usually a size 8/10, and I ordered a 12. They weren't comfortable to wear around the house for WFH, for sure.","22-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/uo-diane-paperbag-wide-leg-pant?color=041","MiriahT","Love these!","I loved these pants and got so many complements on wearing them just once.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/uo-diane-paperbag-wide-leg-pant?color=041","Znjc7","Cute pants, weird waist","The cut is flattering on the legs and hips but the loose fabric around the top of the waist didn’t look right on me. Maybe because I’m too short. But it kinda stuck out and I kept having to smooth it out. Overall, I like the pockets and the style. I think I should’ve sized up and maybe the waist would’ve worked better.","30-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/uo-diane-paperbag-wide-leg-pant?color=041","Rachelpants","Would have worn","These pants are awesome and fit well.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/uo-diane-paperbag-wide-leg-pant?color=041","glamathlete","Sexy? No, but that ain't everything","These pants are definitely man repeller and not what I would wear if I wanted a guy to check out my bum. But hey, I'm a feminist and I like what I like.

Great color for end of summer too. They were a touch big on me. I do a lot of online shopping and rely heavily on clothing measurements to determine which size to order. Since you can't order multiple sizes and don't have the chance to return items throughout the month, I wish measurements were included in the descriptions, since I went with a 27 and found them just a little larger than I would have liked. I wonder if with the continued wear and return, these jeans will stretch out over time and won't get a proper washing so that the cotton will shrink/stiffen back up - I doubt dry cleaning will do it. I found that they were just a touch too big for me by the end of the day. I never dry my jeans, but I think that washing these could really help!

However, they might look cute in my home, but the second I step out of it I feel super frumpy in them. The high rise isn't actually that high, because the waist stretches out and falls down. The length doesn't go past my heel or anything but they are too long to be flattering in this type of cut. If I owned them I definitely would raw hem them.

Great color for end of summer too. They were a touch big on me. I do a lot of online shopping and rely heavily on clothing measurements to determine which size to order. Since you can't order multiple sizes and don't have the chance to return items throughout the month, I wish measurements were included in the descriptions, since I went with a 27 and found them just a little larger than I would have liked. I wonder if with the continued wear and return, these jeans will stretch out over time and won't get a proper washing so that the cotton will shrink/stiffen back up - I doubt dry cleaning will do it. I found that they were just a touch too big for me by the end of the day. I never dry my jeans, but I think that washing these could really help!

Wore this a lot around the house with leggings! Cons: I'm 5'9 and a small was still too large, so it looked frumpy with certain bottoms. Also, the color is more like a light salmon than a true blush or pink, didn't look great with my skin tone.

Wore this a lot around the house with leggings! Cons: I'm 5'9 and a small was still too large, so it looked frumpy with certain bottoms. Also, the color is more like a light salmon than a true blush or pink, didn't look great with my skin tone.

Cute, fun, very comfortable but watch those sleeves!","19-Feb-2020"

I wore it with jeans and sneakers or ankle boots. The one thing to be aware of is that the fringe is pretty long - it got in the way when washing my hands, and some of them are loops that got caught on chair arms. Nothing crazy, but something to be aware of! It's pretty oversized, so there was a lot of room but I didn't mind. Wearing it with skinny jeans balances it out!","10-Dec-2019"

I run between an XS-S in tops and don't love wearing anything too tight. I was glad I ""sized down"" and went with the XS for this - it's slightly cropped but definitely fits like a comfy sweatshirt through the middle. Not sure if this matters to you, but the one I received was more of an off-black than true black. Perhaps it has been laundered too many times but it didnt seem old or ratty, just not true black like the image suggests.","10-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ashley-crewneck-sweatshirt?color=001","allygreens","Great statement sweatshirt, but a bit impractical","It's adorable on and fits great, but the fringe gets in the way of a lot: washing your hands, using the bathroom, and eating, since the fringe goes all the way down to the wrist. Would have been better if they confined the fringe to the back, but adorable nontheless.","28-Feb-2020"

Super fun and cute to wear. Hard to do the dishes or anything with it on. I just took it off or tucked the fringe into the sleeves, lol. I paired with black jeans and a red bandanna, and then with a cute flowy skirt. Will probably rent the black next!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I wore it with jeans and sneakers or ankle boots. The one thing to be aware of is that the fringe is pretty long - it got in the way when washing my hands, and some of them are loops that got caught on chair arms. Nothing crazy, but something to be aware of! It's pretty oversized, so there was a lot of room but I didn't mind. Wearing it with skinny jeans balances it out!","10-Dec-2019"

Unless you are planning to go to something where you’ll be swinging your arms out like the model in the first photo the whole time, I’m not sure this would work.

I run between an XS-S in tops and don't love wearing anything too tight. I was glad I ""sized down"" and went with the XS for this - it's slightly cropped but definitely fits like a comfy sweatshirt through the middle. Not sure if this matters to you, but the one I received was more of an off-black than true black. Perhaps it has been laundered too many times but it didnt seem old or ratty, just not true black like the image suggests.","10-Oct-2019"

I could’ve fit myself, my partner, and my 30 lb dog inside of them. I decided to give it one more go and get the XS this time. The thing about going down in size, is that the length changes. So if you want a gathered waist capri pant circa middle school 1998, these are for you.","1-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/maiia-cropped-wide-leg-jeans?color=001","SadieWaddz","Just wayyyy too big","I have wide hips and I typically wear a M/L, so when I saw that these run large, I decided to go with a Medium. Even a medium was wayyyy too big! There are button adjusters along the waist so that you can take them in, but when you do that, it allows all the excess fabric to bunch and leave weird pleats down the crotch. Maybe a small would've been fine?","25-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/maiia-cropped-wide-leg-jeans?color=001","bmn","Very Cute, Very comfy","LOVE THEM! These pants have been my favorite rental yet. They are a nice dark black denim that i could style with almost anything. They do have buttons on the waist that allow you to adjust from high waisted to low waisted and fit like an edgy, loose, dress pant. I dressed them up and down for coffee dates to business casual meetings and received so many compliments. I do recommend going the size down. I'm typically a size 2/4 and fit well in the xs.","13-Mar-2020"

I wore with crop tops, hoop earrings and boots for a more 90’s throw back feel. They were super flattering on me, which I was worried about because my body type typically looks lost/weird in all the wrong places with a pant that’s large everywhere but the waist.","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/maiia-cropped-wide-leg-jeans?color=001","fjen","Awkward shape, and bigger than you think","At first, when I zipped this up, it was so large that it would just slipped off my hips. I then realized I was supposed to adjust the waist by using the side buttons, that helped make it tighter, but it made my belly/waist look bigger too since it was scrunching the extra material in a bundle together. I think it also needs to be higher waisted, but it sat on my hips just widening my body shape.","9-Mar-2020"

BIG.","I thought perhaps the other reviewers were slightly exaggerated in terms of the size of these pants. But they were not. I am a crossfitter and I have large quads that often don't fit into pants. I could've fit my whole body into one leg of these jeans. They looked like JNCO's. I don't even know if an XS would've made them wearable. These jeans are incredibly confusing. Skip them.","2-Mar-2020"

I would try it again in Spring.","27-Feb-2020"

The hem is a little long and the material is a fancier quality. But, that's not to say I didn't love it. Got tons of compliments when I did wear it at work and it was really comfortable throughout the day. Would suggest sizing down if you don't consider your middle to be your problem area. There are draw strings on the side that can bring it in nice and tight.","24-Feb-2020"

If so, this is not the shirt for you. I was a little shocked by how poorly this fit -- I know many folks who straddle the straight/plus size line who struggle with sleeve fit, but it's never an issue I've had before. This item was overall super perplexing in fit -- the mesh portion is so tight on the center of the bicep that it cuts off circulation, but the bodice is extremely baggy. Additionally, the solid green fabric was visibly pilled, especially around the banded portion. I'd definitely only give this a try if you're quite slim through the arms and don't mind a little wear and tear.","13-May-2020"

The neckline and yoke details are so cute, and the reason I rented, but they were also a little bit itchy due to the mesh/embroidery!

I ordered a size down and wish I would've sized down a good three sizes as the waist is so loose and it continues to stretch out with each wear. They're really stretchy so sizing down shouldn't be a problem. I'm definitely reordering them in my next order but with the correct size. :)","24-Feb-2020"

Decided to take a chance on these and I actually really liked them - the denim is very thick and sucks you in, couldn't even see red underwear beneath them! I sized up to 31 because my other Agoldes run a little tight and these I would say run a little looser - I could have kept my normal size, but they still fit ok. Overall a nice good quality pair of jeans!","20-Feb-2020"

I actually got these in a size down compared to the pair I own, and they fit a little bit better in the booty, so I'm realizing they actually run a little large. They're super sturdy while still being flexible and comfy. Highly recommend!","5-Feb-2020"

But... they run large AND stretch out","I'm a true 27 in all denim brand, including other fits from AGOLDE, so I ordered a 27. When I first tried them on they fit really well in the thighs and hips but were gapping at the waist about an inch or so. After wearing them about 4 times they were basically sitting at my hips. I had to belt them to keep them in place but even with a belt there was some awkward gapping between the butt and waist. If you're going to wear these a bunch of times, I suggest ordering at least one size down.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

My shoulders are broad so most puff sleeves are too puffy, but this was just the right amount.","11-Feb-2020"

Sometimes with these wrap blouses the top can gap open or the bottom can ride up. This fit perfectly. I’d say it runs a tad small so if you’re in between sizes, size up.

So it’s a take it or leave it for me. Not a must have but not a total bust.. I think pear shapes probably look great in this style","28-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ainsley-embroidered-bomber?color=038","Jac","Easy to throw on when running out the door","To be honest, this wasn't my favorite coat when I received it. The embroidery was a bight brighter than I would like and the hem hit strange on me, if zipped up. There are side vertical zippers that should have fixed that, but it just never felt right. That said, I hung this coat by the door and grabbed it all the time to walk the dogs. It goes with everything and is the perfect mid-level weight. I was a little sad to see it go in the end. It had grown on me.","9-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ainsley-embroidered-bomber?color=038","LadyPinecone","Beautiful Jacket","This jacket definitely has an oversized fit, but I wouldn't suggest sizing down unless you tend to fall between sizes. The embroidery is lovely, and the green color makes it almost neutral, versatile jacket. The only downside to the jacket is that it is a little too warm for wearing more than a few weeks out of the year. It was perfect for March, but by mid-April will be too warm, while the pattern gives it a definite spring jacket vibe.","29-Mar-2020"

It's really beautiful and has this very cool, down to earth look to it. I wore it multiple times with some boyfriend jeans, cute boots and a plain pink or white top under.

Since it was bigger, I usually paired it with leggings and boots. If you want a more over-sized look I would recommend the M/L. Loved the gray color too!","12-Mar-2020"

I was able to wear it without a shirt underneath. For Los Angeles it was a bit too warm, but I wore it and got many compliments! Would recommend for colder weather.","3-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-chunky-knit?color=004","Live","GREAT Sweater","I really loved this sweater for being a M/L size if you are a M I would recommend maybe sizing down. I am more of a L/XL and if fit great with some room. Very warm and thick. It was a little itchy just due to the content but with a shirt underneath you will be totally fine!","3-Mar-2020"

I ended up doing a French tuck in my jeans once and then paired with leggings once and liked both. Wish it was just a little smaller in the neck and overall.","28-Feb-2020"

I didn’t find the fabric itchy at all. The chunky knit looks super expensive. I would have kept it but the knit on the sleeve was a little bit frayed. Other than that it was the perfect winter staple!","22-Feb-2020"
