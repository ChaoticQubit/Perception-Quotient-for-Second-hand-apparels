It’s deceptively heavy and warm in a good way. The distressing adds character, but it’s still evident that it’s a well-made garment. There is just no way I think it’s worth this price to purchase.","2-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vintage-30s-suede-jacket2?color=026","Araminta","weird cut","I was so excited about this beautiful vintage jacket, but it has the strangest cut. the button closure is not aligned with the buttonhole so it doesn't close properly. The belt tie is very short, so I wasn't able to tie around me (I am a size 4), so it just hung down the back and I had to keep the front open. Definitely not a practical jacket if you are in any kind of cold weather, and definitely too tight to wear over a sweater. I think if you are very petite, it could work for you, but not for me.","12-Nov-2019"

The jacket itself is beautiful, and fitted. Sadly, in person there are large grey spots and the jacket in general looks dingy. In the picture it looks like it is in mint condition but it is not. I loved the style, but never wore it because I felt it looked dirty.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It's also very long! I'm about 5'6"" and had to tie up a corner so it wouldn't drag when wearing a flat. Other than those 2 things, my only feedback is that this kimono is GORGEOUS. The print is a statement but it's also really easy to wear. I styled it with high-waisted vintage denim and fitted bodysuits, but i also tossed it over my swimsuit once and that was a really cute look as well.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

These pants in particular have so much potential to fit so many shapes and sizes. The lace-up detail in the back is not only a cute aesthetic but has an inch or two of give so that you can tighten or loosen it accordingly to you body type or desired fit.

I'm not sure if it's because I am smaller and curvier than the model but these jeans were MUCH more flared than I would have thought. That being said they were just big enough to land somewhere between 70's costume and just a bold outfit choice. They were a great addition to an outfit when I was feeling like making a statement. They looked great with sweaters tucked in as well as graphic tshirts. I also wore small heeled booties with pointy toes which looked great peaking out of the flares.","3-Dec-2019"

My jean size is either a 25 or 26 and I got a 26 and they are very tight in my butt/hip area. If you have wider hips I would suggest sizing up. If you have narrower hips I think you would be fine with your usual size. They were tight but not too too tight so I still wore them. They are a rigid jean with no stretch so just keep that in mind when picking a size.","22-Jul-2019"

I sized down to a medium based on recommendations, but this still had no shape to it. The midline with the elastic was so loose and that it felt like it was falling down. I think the midline is supposed to be lower than usual, but instead it just was unflattering. The cut of the sleeves that would normally rest on the shoulders droops down towards the elbows.

The waist has an elastic band but it is not tight, so it hangs in a very loose way. Again, it was very comfortable but I would not recommend to anyone who is trying to make an impression. I am usually a large in dresses because of me height, ordered a medium and it is still very baggy.","16-Sep-2019"

It was big on me and hung in the front/waist but I just fixed that by putting a statement belt around it.

This was a really fun item to rent since it's so versatile. I'm on the petite side at 5'1"" and I could have easily pulled this off as a short dress OR I could wear it with jeans/bottoms and wear it as a tunic. One thing to note though, is that it does have a pretty open back, and a deep v so if that's not something you're comfortable with I would suggest a cami or fun printed top to wear underneath. Since FP tends to run large, I went with an XS and I felt it fit well.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It is really boxy and shorter than I expected and fits with ample room across my chest. But I found the arms to be really tight-fitting--like it is hard to do things with your arms (like drive a car) while wearing, especially if you are wearing something else long-sleeved under it. I am tall, and often have the problem of having sleeves be too short, but these I found to be just too constricting!","9-Nov-2019"

This tunic checked off all those boxes so I was eager to receive it and try it. The color in the photos are spot on and the fabric is a soft, lightweight, but still clean and crisp cotton. The style of this top just does no work for someone with a larger bust line. The seam at the top hit the top of my bust in a unflattering way. If you are plus sized with a smaller bust, this would likely look amazing.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I'd get a size up if I ordered it again. I wore it to a Christmas party and got lots of great compliments. My only complaint is that the way the zipper is, it's tricky to take on and off, and since it has to come all the way off to use the restroom, I found it a bit cumbersome. I didn't wear it to another party for that reason, but definitely would recommend for a dinner or event you want to look nice at -- just maybe not to wear all night.","30-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lyra-structured-jumpsuit?color=001","CobraLaserFace","Comfy never looked so cool","I sized up like the other reviews said and it was just a bit baggy in the arms. I think whether you size up or not really has more to do be with proportions. Even though it was a bit loose, it still looked good. Paired it with a blazer for a conference, which looked great with the neckline. I suggest practicing tying the bow so it looks fancy and practice going to the bathroom. 2nd tip is if you are new to jumpers like me. I am a jumper convert now. I thought my torso was too long for them to look good, but this proved me wrong. This thing looked great, was super comfy, and it had pockets! This was my first order from Nuuly and it was all work stuff for a conference. Next order will be for my upcoming vacation and there is definitely going to be a jumper in there.","13-Nov-2019"

The material and colors are soft and feminine which I loved. Like a few other reviewers noted the top has little structure so if you have a medium to large chest I would be wary to wear this as you do feel like you may fall out of it. The straps do adjust in the back which helps but since the material is silkier they slip back to being longer.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I do not have a big chest (36B) and where the stitching is, the dress would not fit correctly.

I was worried it would look too baggy or be too short on me, but I did not think so at all once I tried it on. The color is gorgeous in person and the fabric is thick so it's durable and not see through. Great dress to throw on for any occasion this summer. I am considering buying this piece!","23-Mar-2020"

I'm pretty short so the length wasnt an issue but it could be if you are any taller. There is no give in the waist.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/phoebe-printed-mini?color=009","EJ","super cute but rides up","I love this skirt, it is so cute and fits well (I am usually between 4-6 in bottoms, and a 4 fit perfectly). However, since it's so light weight, it rides up a bit when you are walking. It wasn't too bad, but could get annoying when the zipper slipped around to the front. Otherwise very fun and flattering!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/phoebe-printed-mini?color=009","Kim","Size up if between 2 sizes","This skirt is very cute, but it ran slightly tight in the waist. I ordered a size small and usually I am between XS and S depending on the brand. It fit but was a little tighter than I would prefer. So if you are between sizes, recommend sizing up.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
