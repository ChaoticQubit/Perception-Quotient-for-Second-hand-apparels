"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wild-nothing-embroidered-pants?color=230","Kristychantelle","Cute, stylish, pleasantly surprised.","Loved these pants! They were on rotation a lot. They are a little large and the fit was fine, they hung a little low which I liked. if I were to purchase these, I would go down one size- maybe? they tend to stretch with wear. So I would want to try the 10. The fit is super comfortable, and the 12 looked fine and were relaxed. Like I said, they do have some stretch to them after you've worn them for a few hours.","13-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wild-nothing-embroidered-pants?color=230","Aurora-Fae","Way baggier in real life","These look so flattering and slim in the photos, but in real life, they are so baggy and unflattering. The design is so cute. I wish I could have loved them.","26-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wild-nothing-embroidered-pants?color=230","Kris","Just ok for me","Liked the detail on these, but the fit was slightly weird for a petite person. The waistband was oddly tight but there was plenty of extra room in the hip. The rear pockets stuck out so that a longer top made my butt look way bigger. It was cute with this sweater though!","21-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wild-nothing-embroidered-pants?color=230","Akmajers","Cute and comfortable","I liked the detailing around the waist band that set it off from other cargo pants and camouflage styles.","18-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","WU13","So cool!","So chic, so cool. Alas, I never got around to wearing it but would have been in it all the time if we weren't in the middle of quarantine! It does have a pajamas-like quality, which is why I thought I might wear it around the house but it's just too nice to be cooped up inside! Will rent again when we can venture back out into the world.","23-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","Texassheetcake","I wanted to like it more than I did","I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this brand. But I didn’t love this too as much as I thought it would. Ran a bit big, maybe if I wore it open over a tight black dress and knee high boots it would be cute but I was in London in December wearing it. Solid 7.5/10. I only have one photo wearing it but you can barely see the top unfortunately. Wore with the ivory trucker jacket","5-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","MeganP","Cowboy Anime","I loved this shirt... couldn't wait to wear it! However, I ordered a size down (size 4 instead of 6) and it was still a little tight in the bust. I would order more true to size if you have a average or larger bust.","24-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","prideandjoy0324","Unique","I really like the top but the arms were long on me. I think it’s just the style of the shirt. I didn’t wear it out but I loved the pattern and material of the shirt.","1-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","BriKleify","Funky and fun","I live in Austin, TX so I loved the western cut of this blouse and all the small details down to the tailoring and pearl buttons. This shirt is very well made. I wish i would have looked at the sizing chart because it was a little big on me, this is European sizes so it was a UK 10 and US 6 but it really fit more like a US 8 or 10. I paired with black Madewell cropped fair jeans tucked in and a white mule - got a ton of compliments.","27-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","Liz_mctifhe","Funky Fresh","Fun statement piece. Hard to wear a lot and it’s definitely not everyone’s cup of tea, but I thought it was really fun!","25-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","Sadiejuliana","Great fit, long sleeves","Love the color! The fabric and details are amazing in person! The fit overall is nice but the sleeves ran a little long. Had to cuff it which wasn’t ideal with the detailing of the shirt. Would be perfect for a taller body type!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","GetEdgy","Showstopper","I rented this entire look as seen on Nuuly. This isnt something I would normally do but I wasnt certain I would find a way to wear this little gem if I didnt. I probably shouldve sized down for a more fitted look which I'm certain wouldve helped. This is a beautiful top, designed and finished so nicely I just couldnt find many ways to make work. But man did it garner a ton of compliments when I did.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","Amybrew","Statement!","Really cool and a total statement top. It’s thin and easy to tie up. But unfortunately I didn’t have an occasion to wear it and it was too costum-Y for, like, regular outings.","4-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","Missallie5","Wanted to love this","I wore this with a pair of distressed denim and I really wanted it to work but the sleeves were just SO long, and I’m not one with short arms. It made the whole look seem a bit messy, like I was wearing my boyfriends shirt.","1-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","Jenmaster","Love 💕","I loved this top! It was such a fun statement piece. Every time I wore it, I received so many compliments. I felt like I was a walking Nuuly add every time someone asked me about it.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","emd","Really Cool Top","Probably should have purchased this one. Its really unique and fun to wear. True to size but a bit on the bigger side.","19-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","allthewildair","Really cool","Didn't get a chance to wear it but it is beautiful, a bit loud, it is this bright in person but it's very unique and luxe.","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/green-silk-top?color=030","Kellyirene2","This shirt is a lot of fun","I like this shirt a lot. It’s print is really impressive and it feels nice. I’m not usually able to wear button downs bc of my chest but this one did well for me there. The sleeves are really long so I had to roll them up and the buttons aren’t sewn on very carefully so be careful with that, but otherwise I really like this.","19-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","Shersher13","Perfect Fancy Frock","This jumpsuit was so fun to wear during quarantine. I wore it for my 50th birthday and got many compliments. It was comfortable. You can tell it’s high quality, but that made it a little warm to wear in the sun. Still was worth it.","17-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","Yadeyoung","Amazing","So beautiful, got it for a vacation but unfortunately didn't get to go, so we dressed up at home and that's the only wear this got. It was a beautiful fit, a little long for a short person but fine with heels. Stretchy and super high quality. I wish I could have worn it out!","1-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","Lou","Fun, but scratchy","I was so excited to wear this to all the St Patrick's day celebrations in Chicago, but then, Coronavirus. SO I only got to wear it once to a salsa dancing class and it was sooooo fun and spunky and a beautiful color and shimmer. BUT if you don't wear something with long sleeves over it, the sequins will scratch the crap out of your arms!","31-Mar-2020"

The green is gorgeous and the sparkles add so much flair! The only thing is - the sequins are scratchy so I recommend wearing with a jacket","5-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","Wubs","Fabulous!","Wore this for a party. Looooooooved it. I'd buy it if I could think of enough places I'd wear it to! Very glamorous, flattering, and comfortable.","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","erindg525","Show stopper, beautiful color","I adore this and would wear it again. The color is deep and beautiful. It really accented my eyes, which are also green. It’s fully lined, so comfy despite being covered in sequins.","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","alexandragilreath","Love the color! Weird cut at the waist","I loved the color of this outfit and had really great high hopes for it. I ordered a size up because someone said it ran small on them. It did not cut at my natural waistline and was very large on my hips, therefore, it made me look a balloon with arms. Order the correct size and I think it will be very cute and fun.","18-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","ktOK","comfy and glam","rented for a 70s party. the color is so pretty, but i found it ran a bit short in the torso. even though i'm not very tall, i have a long waist and have problems finding jumpsuits that are long enough. i had to lengthen the straps and keep an eye on the chest to make sure i didn't fall out.","23-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","SRain23","Not quite what I had hoped","I’m not sure what I really expected with this but I definitely know it wasn’t the best fit for me. Fit was true to size but I just didn’t think it was that cute in person. Never wore it out.","23-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","Indiana","If a mermaid wore pants","I wore this for an awards dinner. I did not win any awards, but if there were one for best dressed, I would have been a contender. The only improvements I'd like: pockets, an inch or two longer (I'm 5'8'' and wore a three inch heel and felt it was a little short), and at the end of the night, the inside of my arms were tender from rubbing the sequins while dancing. But it fit like a dream (I'm a size 10 and got the large) and it was flattering and lovely.","22-Jan-2020"

Super comfortable to dance in at a holiday party. Definitely would recommend! I got a L because I'm tall/ have a large bottom/long torso but it was a little loose in the waist (I'm used to that being the case with jumpsuits) so hope that's helpful!","23-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","EB","For like a glove","Fit like a glove and so comfortable!! There’s a bit of stretch and it hangs so nicely with the heavier weight of the fabric. Was a big hit at my holiday parties","22-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/saylor-louisana-jumpsuit?color=037","MaryMchitown","Super fun with some design issues","I loved wearing this jumpsuit! I wore it to a formal Christmas party - the jumpsuit is slightly less fancy than forma (more like cocktail/semi-formal). But it was so unique that no one minded. The pros- great dark teal color, shiny, and it’s lined with a nice fabric. Definitely a unique attention-grabbing outfit. there were a couple issues that took off a star. I’m 5’10” so it was slightly too short, more of a culot style on the legs. And on top, i had to loosen the adjustable (woohoo!) straps to get enough room in the torso. lastly the sequins scratched my arms as I moved them around which left some minor scratches the next day. If you wore this for 8+ hours it probably would be painful! But overall I had a blast wearing it!","20-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dance-magic-tunic?color=001","BeautyChick101","Sheer But Awesome!","So be warned, this top is SHEER. You definitely need a camisole or tank underneath it if you don't want to show off everything to everyone. But, that aside, it's SO cute. It's the perfect length, the perfect swingy and slightly oversized fit, the perfect print, the perfect amount of metallic detail! I wore this so many times throughout the month. Love it!","2-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dance-magic-tunic?color=001","mcnuuly","cute boho tunic","Loved this dress/tunic.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dance-magic-tunic?color=001","Springmommy1221","No lining, runs large","You'll need to wear something under this because there is no lining. Also, just in general it ran very large - I know it's supposed to fit somewhat oversized but I would still size down.","19-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dance-magic-tunic?color=001","c00leen","Lovely Fabric / Blousy Top","This is a lovely top! The fabric has little metallic threads running through it which don't show up well in the photos. It's MUCH better looking in real life! It runs large - I wish I had ordered a size smaller.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dance-magic-tunic?color=001","Apalmer13","Detailed piece","This is really beautiful, and really nicely made, but I just didn’t love the way I styled it. I’m short so expected to wear this as a dress. It’s sheer, so get a black slip ready for use. It’s def short and feels short because of how flowy it is. Not in love, but not bad. Just didn’t feel like it was made to be a dress and it’s too long as a shirt. I guess that’s tunics for you LOL","26-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dance-magic-tunic?color=001","kroseg","Prettier in pictures","This dress was definitely more flattering in the e-com pictures. It also doesn't mention at all that it is completely sheer and see-through so you have to pair it with a slip dress.","11-Dec-2019"

It looks nice and fitted in the picture, but it’s quite oversized. And the deep V style doesn’t really lend itself to the oversize shirt. Something is just a little off.","10-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/all-smiles-striped-top?color=040","ScarlettSH","V Long, Muted colours","Extremely long, so really hard to style as in the photo - definitely size way down if you intend to wear it that way.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/all-smiles-striped-top?color=040","Spinster","Super cute!","Some of the reviews for this shirt gave it a bad rep. But I really liked it! I styled it in many ways - tucked in front like in the picture (but bloused out as it runs long), underneath an oversized sweater, and over leggings. It was great for work specifically - I wore it to meet clients and to a few work-related events. It does have a very artsy vibe - probably more so in person than in the image - so just be forewarned that you will be giving off a very creative vibe. The shirt does run long, but, as long as you're okay with more of a bloused-out look, it's really cute. I didn't have any problems with the material.","7-Mar-2020"

Not really a sweater - it is lined. Very fuzzy and soft. This sweater does shed a bit. I like the cuffs and the hidden snap that keeps the wrap front closed.

It was very straight, so if you have any hips it is not the most flattering. The self tie straps are great to adjust, but just felt bulky.

I wore this out to dinner with friends, a date night with my significant other and on a birthday weekend outing. It is beautifully made, and has such soft and elegant details - like flow-y, balloon sleeves that cinch at the wrists, and open-tie back, high collar neck and and seam detailing that runs down the front of the animal print pattern on this top. The material is very comfortable and breathable. I styled this top mostly with dark denim and black booties, gold jewelry and a black pleather jacket. A great night-out staple!","22-Mar-2020"

I probably could have worn the 4 as well and it would just be less snug. The material is definitely forgiving and the fit is quite flattering. I'm 5'4 and the length was perfect, definitely mini but not riding up my butt. It is not skin tight around the hips and sits nicely. Given the season, I wore it with booties but would look super hot with stilettos in warmer weather. I wish I could have worn it out but that isn't a thing right now with coronavirus.

It showeda little, but it worked. The V-neck is very low, but the bralette helped to make it feel less revealing.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sunny-days-turtleneck?color=040","Bonacker","Not Flattering, Frankly","This turtleneck is a nice pattern. Like the look of the wide sleeves in the photo. In real life, tho, it's a bit too shapeless for me. It's not boxy, exactly, because it's a bit too long -- and the fabric is too drapey -- for that boxy look. It hangs to mid-hip, which is neither here nor there.","18-Dec-2019"

I’m super short and the length was still good on me however if I was an inch shorter it would be too long so 5’2” is probably the shortest you want to be for a size small.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

There is kind of black and navy background with small delicate color details. I thought it was very warm, but maybe not for super below freezing temps. Very cute and I got good use out of it, but the body of the coat is way too oversized for me, and the sleeves were juuuuuust right, bordering on a tiny bit too short. The closure of the sleeves is also this scrunched up fabric that kind of bothered me. Overall, happy I rented, but won’t be buying or renting again.","22-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/butterfly-puffer-coat?color=016","SchnipSchnap","Perfect Puffer for Cooler Weather","This was the perfect jacket for cooler weather in the Philly area in December. I love how it has both snaps and zipper (which is a double-way zipper) so that sometimes I can just quickly snap a few snaps when I'm too lazy to do the zipper. It also has a hood, which makes it very functional! It hits just above the knees for me and kept me warm. I wore this nearly every day and got lots of compliments! I am between sizes M and L, and decided to rent the L so I could layer underneath still. I'd say it fits true to size, as I had plenty of space when wearing lighter weight clothes, but wasn't snug on me when I had thicker clothes on. Would definitely rent this again for cold weather months!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

These had a good six inches extra. I used the fashion tape nuuly provided in the first box to temporarily hem them and that worked perfectly and held in place for both times I wore the pants. They’re super sexy and hug curves in all the right ways, but I felt a little self conscious with the super flashy stars on the butt because they were pretty shiny. If you’re really looking to put that booty out there, go for it, they are very cute and comfortable.","25-Feb-2020"

I really wanted to love them but I only ended up wearing them once as they were too uncomfortable and not flattering.","21-Jan-2020"

The gold star leather patches are fun, but make the fit around the hip area not as giving as the rest of the pants. If you are in between sizes, you might want to size up. They did fit a little snug on me (size 30), but not ridiculously or uncomfortably so. I just wish I found more occasions to wear them.","26-Dec-2019"

I was able to wear my heat tech leggings with them over it, and my butt still looks fantastic! The only qualm I have with this is how long the pant legs are, I am 53 and usually don’t have too many issues with length of pants. But these were so long that I had to wear heels and even so they were still almost dragging on the floor.","26-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/firecracker-flare-jeans?color=001","idkwhattoputhere","I have a lot to say about these jeans","I'm an URBN employee and I go to free people way more than most normal people ever would, and I kept seeing these jeans at free people and I kept trying them on hoping it would work. Every time I tried them on I just felt like they were a little too short, and the employees kept telling me they weren't but I just couldn't justify $140 jeans when they might be too short!! If they were skinny jeans I would deal with it and wear boots over the ankles but not with these flares. so when I saw them on nuuly I was like you know what I'll rent them and if I love them I'll buy them. This is why sometimes nuuly is great, I'm really glad I didn't buy these. I actually love how they look and the fit and the design and I ended up convincing myself that the length was okay, but after wearing them for a few hours my crotch started to hurt so bad because really, they come up RIGHT to the smallest part of your waist and the seam just kind of goes up your butt somewhat and after a while it's really uncomfortable. so if you get them and you're tall like me (5'9), expect to be uncomfortable after a few hours, whether you're sitting or standing.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

But the it went wrong: I do not have an hourglass figure, I’m pretty straight up and down, and these jeans are made for someone whose waist is inches smaller than their hips. The waist on me was about five or six inches away from being able to button. My hourglass friend tried them on and they looked great. Just not for me.","14-Dec-2019"

The arms are connected to the rest of the shirt in a stiff fashion so, if you if your arms up, expect your *entire* midsection to be revealed. Even as-is (arms down), you'll have some midriff. This is the largest size I've ever worn from Nuuly. My 34B chest could barely squeeze into this and there was a lot more chest room to be had (meaning: bigger boobs would fit IF somebody with those could get it on, which they couldn't). I really wanted to love this. If you treat it as a crop top, size up, and dont have large boobs, you can make it work. (hoping to add photo later)","16-Jan-2020"

It's warm and cozy on the inside, while looking cool and effortless on the outside. It's a great jacket for cool-ish (but not cold) spring days on the East Coast or cold, foggy San Francisco winter days. It does run large, so I'm glad that I got an XS instead of a S like I am normally in most brands. it was still roomy enough to wear a sweater underneath, but close enough that the faux shearling kept me warm. Loved throwing it on top of any outfit to make it look that much cooler- almost purchased this one!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/star-valley-coat?color=000","christinanw","OBSESSED","I'm SO in love with this coat. It was hard to part with, and a struggle not to let myself buy, but with summer in California coming up it just didn't feel like a practical purchase. That said, if you are considering renting this, DO IT. Every single time I wore it, I got multiple compliments (if that's your thing), and the lining inside is SO COZY. My fiance started making fun of me every time I put on my ""statement jacket"" because I was sooo excited about it and just looking for reasons to wear it places. I actually can't wait until I have a need to rent it again. I run between a S and a M in pretty much everything, and the S was perfect - definitely a bit oversized.","25-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/star-valley-coat?color=000","mialovesnuuly","Funky pattern for fall to spring!","The colors, patterns and look of this jacket make my SPIRIT FASHIONISTA SO HAPPY - EVERYTHING about this jacket is my vibe - Loved the colors on this fun piece! Great quality, and can be wore over a ton of different outfits. Like a few of the reviews, this jacket runs a bit big, but also was made to look ""oversized"" when worn. I typically wear a Medium/Large for jackets but got a Small because of the other reviews and was overall happy with the fit, when worn over chunkier layers. Next time (because I'd love to order this jacket again!) I'd try the Extra Small to wear this over lighter layers - Love Love LOVE this jacket though and totally recommend!!!","22-Mar-2020"

I would guess it would best fit a size L, if not XL. My boyfriend is pretty bulky and wears a men’s M-L and it fits him perfectly. I know it’s supposed to be oversized and honestly the length and mid section don’t bother me but the sleeves are too long and the shoulders aren’t even in the ballpark of fitting mine. I’m technically petite but I have decent sized shoulders and wear and xs-s depending on the brand so my advice is to order 1-2 sizes down and not worth ordering if you are an xs in fp unless you want your heart broken!!","1-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/star-valley-coat?color=000","Arti","Loved this coat, but with a caveat","First off, this truly is a statement jacket: I received so many compliments on it. It’s warm and snuggly, though definitely large. I opted for a medium in it and it was perfectly oversized. I could wear a thick sweater underneath it and it still fit loosely. That said, the jacket started fraying after a few uses and the threads would get caught on my purse. There were so many loose threads, the jacket looked worn after only having it a month. If I had purchased it, I would have been so frustrated. It is a beautiful jacket, though. Just be careful while wearing it and size down.","26-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/star-valley-coat?color=000","SmallButMighty","Cute but Large","This jacket definitely fulfills its oversized style, I was swimming in the small. I think I could have sized down and it still would have the oversize style but feel more proportional to my body. It was cute and I still got some good wears out of it, just wish I had sized down. It was warm enough for a day in the 40s but nothing lower than that. The pockets are also lined by very sharp zippers.","26-Dec-2019"

It’s fine wearing around the house, but I don’t think I’d ever wear it anywhere else.

I wore this more times than I can count. It is so soft, fits perfectly, and works in any situation. I wore it on an airplane, to the gym, out with friends and every single morning on the beach for warmth. I’m a Free People Junkie but this is a classic!","22-Dec-2019"

I’m tall so even with high waisted jeans my by belly is out. It’ll be nice for weekend with high waisted leggings or something casual. I won’t be buying it bc the fit is so odd which is unfortunate because it’s pretty and soft","13-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bff-sweater?color=048","MackenzieMeyer","Cozy Sweater","I loved this sweater and wore it quite a few times! The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars was because I felt like it stretched out a bit and I was worried how it would hold up in the wash...probably the only reason I didn't keep it if I am being honest. A comfortable fall/winter sweater, though!","12-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bff-sweater?color=048","riri","Lovely loose sweater","Cropped at a good length—not too short. The fit is loose, so don't expect that it'll be a curve-hugging sweater. It's pretty thick as well.","10-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bff-sweater?color=048","vsuz","Cozy crop","I really do like this sweater a lot and you can wear it with virtually any bottoms. Super soft and comfy, a little more cropped than anticipated when I raise my arms but with a high waist it’s fine. Docked it by one star because it gets caught on EVERYTHING. Doors and long earrings are not your friend in this sweater, otherwise love","9-Dec-2019"
