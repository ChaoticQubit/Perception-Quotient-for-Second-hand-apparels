I did get complements on it but personally didn't love it. Fit true to size.","23-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bishop-sleeve-crushed-velvet-top?color=041","Asil","Pretty color but too trendy","Fun velvet, pretty color but neck & sleeves were a bit much all together. Didn’t end up wearing.","21-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bishop-sleeve-crushed-velvet-top?color=041","Lauryn","Fit was off","The neckline was a bit odd and the fit around the body was boxy. I didn't end up wearing it. Pretty fabric though.","18-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bishop-sleeve-crushed-velvet-top?color=041","KristieD143","Perfect top for the office!","I wasn't overly excited about this top but wanted to wear it under a blazer that I also rented. When I received the shipment and tried this on, I kinda fell in love! The color is beautiful, the fit is perfect, and it's super soft. I love how feminine this looks, and that's not something I typically like. I may actually purchase this one!","2-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bishop-sleeve-crushed-velvet-top?color=041","SustainabilitySam","just not that cute on me","I really liked this top! I really did. I guess the problem was I couldn't really find a cute outfit to wear it with. I wore it to work once and that was it. It's still really cute, fit well, idk it just didn't do it for me. May try the peach/amber color and see if I can make an outfit i like more.","2-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bishop-sleeve-crushed-velvet-top?color=041","KristinAmber","Short top, pretty color","Wanted to love this. I'm a fan of the sleeves and the color. Bold and yet not wild. The crushed velvet is nice. I noticed that folks touched me more when wearing this. (hugs, etc) Very alluring fabric. The only bummer is that it's too short for my average torso. I found it not long enough to be flattering. It hit right where my pants start. Just a bit awkward. Would be nice if you're into high waited pants. That would work well.","3-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bishop-sleeve-crushed-velvet-top?color=041","PattyMcK","so-so","This was soft and cozy but not all that flattering on me. Neck kinda plain. Form fitting in the torso in a way that didn't work of me.","1-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bishop-sleeve-crushed-velvet-top?color=041","katieb","Wanted to love it but it was too small","Loved the color. Loved the fabric. Unfortunately, the sleeves ended well before my wrists. I'm always a Medium, so I'm surprised this didn't fit. I might try a large in another rental although I'm not sure the body would fall in the right place. The top seemed like the right length for me other than the sleeves.","31-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bishop-sleeve-crushed-velvet-top?color=041","Doomy","Cute, dressy","I had imagined dressing this down, but that was harder to pull off than I expected, so I only wore it once. It fit well but a little right in the cuffs and was too thick to tuck into thin, soft pants. I wore it all day, taking care of my small children and baking a cake and it still looks great so clearly hides stuff well. Pretty color.","25-Jan-2020"

I wore it several times...mostly with black jeans. I got A LOT of compliments. It definitely made me stand out. I would say that it fits on the smaller side though.","19-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bishop-sleeve-crushed-velvet-top?color=041","Jackie05","Loved","Super comfy, good for cold weather, looked great! It was cropped a bit long for me, so there was a bit too much material when tucked in, but overall loved this top.","13-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/uo-jasper-half-zip-hoodie-sweatshirt?color=000","Arren","Nice but sheds a lot","It's a nice, warm hoodie that I enjoy wearing, but the fuzz/fluff on the inside sheds a lot and gets all over everything. I am constantly finding fuzz from it in my bag, in my car, on my workout clothes, on my skin... it's comfy but at a price. haha. I recommend it either way though but maybe don't wear a black shirt underneath it!","17-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisanne-velvet-bomber?color=061","NatalieH","LOVE!","The perfect jacket for the change in seasons -- sometimes it's warm but sometimes it's freezing. The color is beautiful and surprisingly goes with a lot! I wore it for walks around the neighborhood with jeans and also over a casual cotton dress. It would be extremely easy to dress up for date night too -- skinny jeans and a black top with some stilettos would be stunning! Definitely would rent again.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisanne-velvet-bomber?color=061","Tauberl","Cute and a little different","This was a good quarantine piece, pretty cozy while still feeling a little fancy with the gold zipper and the embroidery. It's more of a fitted piece. Fun to have for a few weeks.","7-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisanne-velvet-bomber?color=061","midnightoil","Runs Big","The zipper is rose gold, which I didn't notice until this arrived. It's a cool jacket but the medium (my usual size) ran so big on me, I never wore it. I would recommend sizing down if you don't plan to zip it up.","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisanne-velvet-bomber?color=061","Femmepdx","Velvet and satin","The satin inside is luxurious and also makes this jacket nice and warm. It was a little dressier than I expected, so I only wore it to work and not casually.","16-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisanne-velvet-bomber?color=061","PeaceLoveU","The most beautiful thing!!!!","I adored this item!! Feel like I wore this beauty almost everyday, and the compliments never ceased. Super flattering, perfect for Texas winter, and the satin inside makes you feel like you're not wearing pajamas.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisanne-velvet-bomber?color=061","Swamptronica","This jacket looks very pretty and is totally wearable while being fun.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisanne-velvet-bomber?color=061","Martha","Gorgeous color!","Loved this. Really gorgeous color. But warning: the embroidery on the sleeves has some sparkle in the thread. It made jacket a little more whimsical and less cool/modern.","27-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisanne-velvet-bomber?color=061","Luna79","So luxurious!","If I had rented a M, I would have purchased this. It is absolutely beautiful. The inside lining is silky and smooth, making it feel wonderful to slip on and off. The color is a little more orange that it appears on my screen, just FYI, but still beautiful. The embroidery is subtle and adds some serious style. Not a super warm jacket, but I'm in Texas, so not really a requirement.","9-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisanne-velvet-bomber?color=061","Wendal","Just order this jacket","Roomy enough to wear a sweater underneath. Received so many complements on this jacket. I want to buy it.","29-Dec-2019"

It fits great and is so cute, but every time I take my parka off it sounds like I'm ripping velcro and my hair goes all over the place. I wore it to work (biz cas) with jeans, white sneakers, and a black tee underneath. Love the rose gold zipper!","19-Dec-2019"

However, I also like spicing up my activewear! I mostly own single solid-colored items. I had a lot of fun adding this more bright and colorful item into the mix. I liked that it was see-through and showed off my tops even when fully zipped. No one ever told me they liked it, haha, but several people did say, ""You're bringing the 80s back!"" It was very fun and I liked it. Ultimately I didn't keep it because it didn't keep me warm, didn't protect against weather/ climate, and was a bit noisy when the fabric rubbed against itself. Fun while I had it. No regrets. Great item to rent.","14-Mar-2020"

It was not anywhere remotely long enough to be considered a dress (and I love mini dresses) but at the same time the top was way too loose, and so low cut you’d have to wear something under it if you weren’t into showing off your bra. Even if it were long enough I think just overall it’d be super awkward.","17-Jan-2020"

It's wearable, and cuter with a belt or sweater, but it's too big to be super flattering. (And I think loose dresses often look elegant!) I also feel like the arms are attached to the body too far down, so it sort of pulls when you move around, and the high neck can get pulled back uncomfortably when you sit.","28-Feb-2020"

In terms of sizing, I would say it runs true to size. The neck can get a little tight, if you sit in the dress a certain way, but that can easily be avoided by giving the dress a little slack before sitting down.","14-Jan-2020"

It has this weird shimmery look to some threading and looked a bit rundown too. The cut is also off. the vneck is VERY low and so are the bra cups so you're left with a very low cut top (way too low cut for work) and a saggy bust.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-chiffon-dress?color=009","Ladylazyrus","Cute, sparkly, flattering","This dress was so cute, very holiday and sparkly! It fit well, a little large. Great length, not too short at all, you can definitely wear w/o tights. It is that kind of babydoll/empire waist style where there are the boob cups, then a wide, oversized waist below. So if you have smallish/just the right size for this dress boobs they will fit the cup part perfectly then the waist will hit at your actual waist and flow beautifully down. But if you have slightly larger boobs like me, the bottom of the boob cup hits about 3/4 down my boob so the waist kind of flares out and protrudes more off your body, hiding any stomach too.

It also was designed for smaller chested people because there were seams on the boobs (you can't really tell in the photos) but the seams are def meant to fall under your boobs and if you are larger chested, the neckline would be a little exposing or the seam will go right across your chest.","29-Jan-2020"

The chest area was a bit loose so if you don’t size down you may need pins or fashion tape.","4-Jan-2020"

It is so pretty in person - expensive looking, sparkly, classy. I love it. BUT there is no place for my boobs. I was expecting to have a lot of cleavage, but the area between the shoulder and the under breast band is so high up. Since the band is already loose around my rib cage I doubt that sizing up would help at all. BEAUTIFUL dress, perfect for girls with smaller chests.","28-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-chiffon-dress?color=009","Cynthia_Warshany","Cute for the holidays","I wore this dress to my work holiday party. It is a dark green color with silver metallic flake details on it. It had a black lining under it, so the only part that was sheer were the sleeves. It was super cute and comfortable. The V cut was a little deeper than I thought it was going to be - so you'll just need to wear the right bra for it. I didn't find it to be too short or tight anywhere - it was true to size.","26-Dec-2019"

I ordered this as an option for NYE or any other holiday gathering that popped up but didn't end up wearing it. The skirt was super heavy, so it tended to get dragged down off of my waist down my hips which made me look wider than I would have if it stayed in place on my smallest part. Ultimately clothes like this skirt are exactly why I rent now, it was a great statement piece that I played around with, and ultimately returned when I was done with it!","9-Jan-2020"

The texture of the corduroy made the utility look a bit more elevated. I wore it to work and out with friends. I'm normally a 4, but got a 6 since 4 was unavailable. The 4 would've fit, but I liked the look sizing up created. I styled it with mock necks underneath and cuffed the sleeves and legs. I'm 5'3"" and did not have to cuff it - it came right to my ankles.

My only warnings to others is: It’s a very short length. I’m actually pretty short and found that while sitting the pants don’t come down as far as I’d like, so tall girls take warning! I would’ve preferred the legs be too long and then could’ve cuffed them which would’ve been cute. I also felt like I looked a bit like a train conductor or custodial staff at times as well. Overall, a cute look and doesn’t take much effort to look cohesive and stylish! Just throw it on! The color in my photo looks darker than it does in person. In person it’s definitely a navy blue as shown in the product image.","14-Feb-2020"

I would have bought them had I not found them on sale at Anthro in my size for cheaper :) They were so flattering and fun, and I loved the length of them and how they show your shoes instead of hide them. I did rent a petite size but probably could have gone either way and they'd still look good because of the design of the pant.","19-May-2020"

When they arrived the fit was not the same, they were stretched causing them not to fit the same way even though they were the same exact size I tried on in the store.

And the waste produced during the process is almost 100% recycled. So from a sustainable standpoint Two Thumbs Up. From a handfeel standpoint, BRILLIANT. It's drapey like Tencel but feels more like a sandwashed silk - drapey and lovely and soft. I kept telling people to pet my sleeve all day and they were like ""oooh."" It's that nice. The color is BEAUTIFUL and the fit was generous without being sloppy. I would have bought it (AND the black one just like it) if it wasn't SO so expensive.

Add it to your next nuuly and you'll understand - unless you don't want to tempt yourself to purchase.","29-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/everyday-button-down-blouse?color=001","Bettye","I Wish Every Shirt Was This Shirt","This is the first time I've had anything made of Cupro and it is MAGICAL! Cupro is made of natural materials but the fabrication process is chemical. HOWEVER, the fabric itself, once manufactured, is completely biodegradable. And the waste produced during the process is almost 100% recycled. So from a sustainable standpoint Two Thumbs Up. From a handfeel standpoint, BRILLIANT. It's drapey like Tencel but feels more like a sandwashed silk - drapey and lovely and soft. I kept telling people to pet my sleeve all day and they were like ""oooh."" It's that nice. The color is BEAUTIFUL and the fit was generous without being sloppy. I would have bought it (AND the black one just like it) if it wasn't SO so expensive. I wore it to work over black jeans and white jeans, once under a black cardigan...and I wanted to also wear it under my black and white plaid blazer but I just ran out of time!","26-Jan-2020"

The material is really nice but the fit was off, particularly in the chest/bust.

Fabric feels silky, but isn’t. And it has tiny snaps between the buttons so bye bye boob gap! I’m an average 8 in dresses, can be a M or L in tops, 36D and the 2xs fit me like a glove.

Relatively simple, cotton relaxed dress. Something about the draping adds extra bulk at the thighs, which was not flattering on me when I already have enough in that area! Also at 5'10"", it hit at the wrong spot on my calves - the dress bunched around my knees as I walked. I did wear it a few times because I liked the fabric and color - I actually wore it on a couple flights, so was really comfy for that! But I wouldn't get it again because it's not very flattering on me.","17-Oct-2019"

An 8 (one size down) would have been perfect. On the US site this jean comes in two lengths. I wish Nuuly would have specified which inseam these were.

I took it on a ski trip and it was a perfect blend of form and function. The zipper was slightly difficult to open/close as it would get stuck frequently. The stuffing in the jacket would also clump up a lot in an uneven way, making the jacket look odd at times. Because of this, it wasn't as warm as you might think based on how it looks.

It's an incredibly stiff almost plastic taffeta which is itchy in itself, and then the sequins add another layer of scratchiness. So sad, but I definitely do not recommend.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-sweater?color=001","kelleybdeal","So comfy!","I'm actually wearing this right now - I really love the fit. It's stretchy and comfy and seems to hang the way you want it to, and feels cozy. It is pretty bright, but maybe I'm just used to neutrals ... but cute - I toned it down with an olive jacket and some dark jeans. I'll definitely wear it again.","16-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/long-sunset-hooded-cardi?color=066","PattiCakes","Gorgeous and Pink","Loved this! Lots of compliments, and so fun. Had no idea I was wearing a $700.00 sweater! Fun to know you can enjoy that luxury for a short time. But, very fuzzy....and you will be using a lint roller often!","22-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/long-sunset-hooded-cardi?color=066","Megan225","Fun but scratchy","It's a fun cardigan but is probably better suited for warmer weather where you can wear it without anything over it. The material is a bit scratchy and the sleeves are bigger than they look and have sequins on them. I didn't love this piece, probably wouldn't rent again.","3-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/long-sunset-hooded-cardi?color=066","brooke23","Wanted to make this work but couldnt","I really wanted to wear this, but it just never worked out for me. It was very itchy, very bright, and sparkly along the edges. I didn't think it would be as bright and sparkly as it appears in the picture, and that's just not my style.","29-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/long-sunset-hooded-cardi?color=066","gionna0nakieta","Statement, casual piece","Was fun to have a casual sweater that also made a statement. Got lots of complements (male & female! :). Styled with blue and white denim. Only issue would be that the fuzziness sheds a bit.","24-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/long-sunset-hooded-cardi?color=066","breis","NOT as expected","Look- This sweater looks gorgeous. I was so excited! However, like many other reviewers, i found that it ran way small, was itchy, and shed EVERYWHERE. The actual length only came to about my knees (I'm 5'9"") and the overall look was just not as luxe and cozy as the image. The colors are lovely and gorgeous, but I seriously had pink fuzzes and fibers all over my clothes, car, desk seat...everything. If you're shorter, more petite, and willing to lint roll every 15 mins, though, this really it very cute.","19-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/long-sunset-hooded-cardi?color=066","Glittergirl","Pretty but itchy!","This is a lovely sunset color. The sweater fit me nothing like the stock photo. it was not very full and didn't wrap around me....also it came just under my knee in length (I'm 5'9"") The real problem was the itch factor though.","3-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/long-sunset-hooded-cardi?color=066","HiThere","Super fun","This is something that I probably would never buy, but it was really fun to wear over the past month. I definitely felt like I had to have a very specific outfit with it though.","31-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/long-sunset-hooded-cardi?color=066","8RaeRae8","Many Compliments!v","Every time I wore this sweater multiple people complimented. It felt cozy, warm, and protective. Be aware that it does ahead slightly, and at times can be a bit itchy. Neither were significant enough to stop me from wearing this sweater","29-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/long-sunset-hooded-cardi?color=066","Personpdx","Very pretty and warm","I loved the colours of this lightweight and warm cardigan. It is a bit shorter in me than on the model, I’m 5’11”, so it wasn’t quite as dramatic as I hoped. I didn’t like the metallic yarn around the cuff region. It is a nice rental.","23-Jan-2020"

If you’re on the shorter side for sure wear it! Wished it had pockets + was a bit longer but super fun","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I loved how it felt on and would have bought it except for the price tag. I'll be dreaming about this one.","2-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/long-sunset-hooded-cardi?color=066","kelseymarieclaire","Hand Knit, One of a kind","The quality of this Cardi is A+, however I wish it looked as cute on me as it does on the model. I found the M/L size to be big. I should have ordered a size XS/S so that I wasn't worried it was making me look huge. The material is soft but a tiny bit on the itchy side if you are not wearing a long sleeve underneath it. Overall its a unique piece but I would not buy it or rent again.","9-Dec-2019"
