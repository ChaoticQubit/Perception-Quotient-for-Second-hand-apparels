It was so cute and comfortable to wear to a farmers market. I didn’t wear a bra and it hurt afterwards but definitely worth it to look so cute!","3-May-2020"

Would definitely rent again when we can get out more. Can be dressed up for a night out with booties or with sneaks.it is pretty long. I did have to role bottom 3 times for a cropped look.","1-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/go-west-utility-jumpsuit?color=031","jillcarter","Perfection","This jumper is perfection. The cut out in the back makes it just sexy enough to dress up for a date, but it's casual enough to wear all day and be a cool mom in. I absolutely LOVED it the second I put it on and new I was going to keep it!","1-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/go-west-utility-jumpsuit?color=031","scooter","Super cute - runs a little big for FP","I really liked this jumpsuit! Super comfortable and easy to wear (I wore it with a turtleneck underneath and a bit cozy sweater on top). The only slight negative was that it runs pretty big for Free People. I'm usually a medium in their stuff but I definitely could have gone with a small. It gaped in the waist, which was okay for me, but if you wanted to wear it by itself I think it'd be too big.","30-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/go-west-utility-jumpsuit?color=031","chelseahaha","Runs Large","I wasn't able to wear it the whole time since it was too large but it's super cute. If you're petite, I would not recommend, waste of a rental spot.","27-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/go-west-utility-jumpsuit?color=031","Geriisawesome","Casual Everyday Errand Outfit","Loved this and wore it a lot, it would be a bit more flattering if it were more fitted in the hips but the looseness is still pretty cozy and made me want to wear it all the time. Great for travel... except having to remove layers to go to the bathroom.","27-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/go-west-utility-jumpsuit?color=031","Pixiebelle","Adorable","I love this outfit , it is so comfortable and sexy. I did not wear it often however, as there are two buttons in the top back that I really struggled to button! Since you have to take it all off to use the bathroom and undo these buttons, this part was really frustrating for me and made it a bit inconvenient for me to wear. The look and feel however is perfect .","11-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/azalea-tee?color=230","karenriv","May keep this one!","Loved this shirt so much. I wore a tank top underneath when going out and it still looked super cute. It is very big even for a medium so definitely size down.","19-May-2020"

The color is just stunning and I didn't have to worry about being bloated or anything bc I just tie in the front and VOILAAAA!! This dress is just so put together.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/energized-shirt-dress?color=039","MBrunsy1","Love this","It fit everywhere else perfectly except it’s about an inch too short. I’m 5’9 and curvy. I have a problem with a lot of dresses being too short. The large was too big and bunched too much when I tried it on. Length on the large would have worked though.","30-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/energized-shirt-dress?color=039","Chechoc","Work dress","Super cute piece, although this ran a little big. I wish it was a little more fitting. I have an athletic body type already (boxier mid section) and this didn't help accentuate the waist the way i wanted. Still such a fun pattern and great outfit for work and networking events.","26-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/energized-shirt-dress?color=039","Snabby","Very cute, but ultimately too large on top","I loved this dress and it's such a cute style, but I think the top works better on busty-er people. Perhaps it would have been better for me in a S rather than a M. Even after tying the belt I felt that it was way too loose on top and made me look boxy.","24-Mar-2020"

It was too tight in the hips for me to be confident and the straps were way too long and not adjustable.

I felt sexy, confident, fun, playful, bold. I absolutely loved this dress. The fabric felt luxe. The pattern had extra secret polka dots that reflected in the light, resulting in extra dimension. I had every intention of keeping this, but when COVID-19 escalated, I couldn't justify the cost. I'm budgeting for essentials now. Unfortunately, this isn't a Need. I did send selfies to someone I like, expecting him to say he didn't like it and that it was too Minnie Mouse, but he loved it too. Maybe one day I'll come back for this item.

I'm afraid a large would cause the top to just be too big. As it is, it felt a little big on top with the medium. I really loved the style and it is super flattering (if I could just zip it all the way).

Been pairing it with high-waisted leggings. Extremely cozy--I sized up because I'm between small and medium. The base color is not bright white like it appeared to me in pictures, rather it's off white (could've been discolored from time and wear, hard to tell).

I was expecting it to have a more warm/golden 70s vibe to it, but instead what came to mind was orange sickle, sherbet ice cream, which is not a go to color palette for me. Once I finally got the courage to try it on, I immediately wished I had given it a better chance as it is oh so cozy and not nearly as harsh looking on as I thought it would be. I still wouldn’t purchase it in this color as FP offers it in other shades I wear more comfortably, but overall this is such a great sweater and and the fit is just about as good as it gets for my taste!

The base color is not bright white like it appeared to me in pictures, rather it's off white (could've been discolored from time and wear, hard to tell).

I was expecting it to have a more warm/golden 70s vibe to it, but instead what came to mind was orange sickle, sherbet ice cream, which is not a go to color palette for me. Once I finally got the courage to try it on, I immediately wished I had given it a better chance as it is oh so cozy and not nearly as harsh looking on as I thought it would be. I still wouldn’t purchase it in this color as FP offers it in other shades I wear more comfortably, but overall this is such a great sweater and and the fit is just about as good as it gets for my taste!

Been pairing it with high-waisted leggings. Extremely cozy--I sized up because I'm between small and medium. The base color is not bright white like it appeared to me in pictures, rather it's off white (could've been discolored from time and wear, hard to tell).

Once I finally got the courage to try it on, I immediately wished I had given it a better chance as it is oh so cozy and not nearly as harsh looking on as I thought it would be.

Been pairing it with high-waisted leggings. Extremely cozy--I sized up because I'm between small and medium. The base color is not bright white like it appeared to me in pictures, rather it's off white (could've been discolored from time and wear, hard to tell).

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bardot-sweater?color=040","Shanna","Tons of Compliments!","Loved this sweater and received plenty of compliments on it. It fit true to size, but is short as you can tell from the photo. It will rise up when you move your arms, so be cautious of that. Overall, great sweater and would order again in other colors.","24-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bardot-sweater?color=040","meggybee","Cute & Casual","This sweater is super cute. Wore it multiple times with high waisted jeans. Definitely cropped, so if you don’t like your belly showing when you lift your arms, this isn’t for you. The only reason I didn’t do 5 stars is because the material is a bit rough, I thought it would be cozier.","23-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bardot-sweater?color=040","Charasann","A pleasant surprise","When this sweater arrived, I honestly took one look at it and was so upset by it’s tangerine brightness that I didn’t event take it out of the bag until a few days before my returns were due. I was expecting it to have a more warm/golden 70s vibe to it, but instead what came to mind was orange sickle, sherbet ice cream, which is not a go to color palette for me. Once I finally got the courage to try it on, I immediately wished I had given it a better chance as it is oh so cozy and not nearly as harsh looking on as I thought it would be. I still wouldn’t purchase it in this color as FP offers it in other shades I wear more comfortably, but overall this is such a great sweater and and the fit is just about as good as it gets for my taste! Wish I had one in every color!!","22-Feb-2020"

I was expecting it to have a more warm/golden 70s vibe to it, but instead what came to mind was orange sickle, sherbet ice cream, which is not a go to color palette for me. Once I finally got the courage to try it on, I immediately wished I had given it a better chance as it is oh so cozy and not nearly as harsh looking on as I thought it would be. I still wouldn’t purchase it in this color as FP offers it in other shades I wear more comfortably, but overall this is such a great sweater and and the fit is just about as good as it gets for my taste!

The base color is not bright white like it appeared to me in pictures, rather it's off white (could've been discolored from time and wear, hard to tell).

I was expecting it to have a more warm/golden 70s vibe to it, but instead what came to mind was orange sickle, sherbet ice cream, which is not a go to color palette for me. Once I finally got the courage to try it on, I immediately wished I had given it a better chance as it is oh so cozy and not nearly as harsh looking on as I thought it would be. I still wouldn’t purchase it in this color as FP offers it in other shades I wear more comfortably, but overall this is such a great sweater and and the fit is just about as good as it gets for my taste!

The white holds up well, and the pants are sturdy.","9-Mar-2020"

The XS was a good two sizes too big for me, and I felt like I was drowning in it. The belt helped but it never stayed in place.

My only qualms are that it is a LOT of fabric, which can feel kind of heavy, and the belt kept coming undone for me. Overall, a beautiful piece that I would rent again. Loved the retro look.

However, due to having a long torso, the shirt appeared quite short and boxy. The sleeves seemed puffy and three quartered. Didn't look right","18-Feb-2020"

The only frustrating part was not realizing the skip detaches from the chiffon layer, which made getting on the first time nearly impossible. Ended up buying because it was so beautifully boho.","28-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/talulah-tiered-midi-dress?color=015","jessicasy","Beautiful but tight around the chest","I didn't wear the dress because it fits too tight around the chest and arms, which makes moving my arms around very uncomfortable. The dress itself is very beautiful. I ordered XS which is my usual size for normal or loose fitted clothes. I recommend ordering one size up if you have a larger upper body like me.","14-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/talulah-tiered-midi-dress?color=015","Erin77","Surprised","I wasn’t expecting to be blown away by this dress but I’m pleasantly surprised. The fit on this is spot on for me and I just think it’s a great choice if you want be look cute and still maintain comfort. Very boho look to it. The dress comes with a slip, which worked fine. Normally I’m not crazy about this fabric but this felt fine on the body. To warm for hot summer months but perfect for spring and even for the fall with some boots. Will definitely consider purchasing","2-Apr-2020"

This is a beautiful dress that can be worn with boots in fall and winter and with sandals in the spring time. Wonderful coverage for a DD chest and respectable length for someone 5’2. Great dress!!!","14-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/talulah-tiered-midi-dress?color=015","MollH","Felt like a bag lady","The fit was so off on this. It was the right size, but the waist didn’t hit where is should and just generally I felt it was too flowy and baggy. I tried a belt and even wearing a jean jacket over it but it looked off. A word to fair skin girls - this color doesn’t do anything!","11-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/talulah-tiered-midi-dress?color=015","KeelyT","Gorgeous In Person","I love this dress. When i got it, it still had the tags on it so I figured I was the first to wear it. I think any plus size girl would look amazing in this dress. I felt so pretty even though I ordered a size too big. I got so many compliments! I have a small chest for a plus size woman so it was a bit big in that area, so if you are blessed to have a large chest, this will fit amazing. I would rent this again in a smaller size!","28-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/talulah-tiered-midi-dress?color=015","peaches333","Midi Dress Perfection","I never wear midi dresses. I've always wanted to but being 5'4"" they never seem to hit in the right place? And being 165#, they can be less than flattering. This one was wonderful. The pattern works to direct the eye away from your waist and is tailored to slim in the right places. I needed a belt to complete the look, but it worked for me!","27-Feb-2020"

I tried this while social distancing just in case. Luckily, I ordered the petite & it fit perfectly. I thought it was really pretty & feminine. I'll try this again in both prints.","12-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/clementina-halter-maxi-dress?color=266","MaBelle","Fine fit, solid dress","I didn’t have the same fit issues as other reviewers, so that was a relief. Length was great. That said, this dress was pretty, but not the *most* flattering on my 34D bust. Color is definitely muted, so keep that in mind.","1-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/clementina-halter-maxi-dress?color=266","Aimes","Bought it without hesitation!","Based on other reviews, I must have the right height and proportions for this dress. It's sort of crinkly which means it will travel well, and it's great on its own, or under a jacket or blazer or cardigan, or over a tee or turtleneck. It's going to be a staple for me this spring and summer.","1-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/clementina-halter-maxi-dress?color=266","rbfly","Soft and luxurious!","I love this dress! I think it’s going to be my first Nuuly buy :). It’s so comfortable and looks fantastic, I wore it with a long black duster and heels. But also wore it with tennis shoes and a sweater for walks during quarantine. The fabric has really beautiful colors and flows so gently in the wind!","29-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/clementina-halter-maxi-dress?color=266","SFMamaBear","Floral with a touch of the wild side","I wanted to love this dress but the top part was just not particularly flattering for my bosom. I might have sized up for comparison? That said, I would have still worn this on my vacation (sadly that was cancelled). I do find this a very fun combo of prints!","27-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/clementina-halter-maxi-dress?color=266","FitnessElizabeth","Super cute but a little scratchy","I ordered this for spring break, which we had to cancel due to coronavirus so I never got to wear it. I would say that the neckline is super tight to pull over your head. And I would have been thrilled to wear it once or twice had we gone on vacation, but I have to say, the material is pretty scratchy so don't regret not owning it.","17-Mar-2020"

The straps are not adjustable and the rouching which is supposed to be under the bust was in the middle of my chest. For the record, I am not at all busty. I could also hardly move my arms the shoulders were so tight.","11-Mar-2020"
