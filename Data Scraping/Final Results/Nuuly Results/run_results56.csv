"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tie-front-floral-midi?color=049","mrae","Flattering, pretty dress","I recently wore to a work event, and the length/fit was perfect. It was very flattering, but not too exposing. I kept it because I could also wear with sneakers or sandals in the summer for a daytime look. It fit my chest perfectly, but i could see some sizing issues if you need a little more room around the chest. Also, the elastic in the cap sleeves was a little snug, but nothing that bothered me too much. Excited to wear again!","12-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tie-front-floral-midi?color=049","lolalorraine","Nice Silhouette, Underwhelming Quality","I added this to my nuuly because I was drawn to the vintage vibe, the length, and romantic simplicity. I like that it acts as a transitional summer-to-fall sundress. The lining underneath is made of a pretty heavy material. It looked really cute with a chunky sweater layered over it, woven flats and a wide brimmed hat, I wore it to a casual afternoon shopping and lunch date with a girlfriend. Downside: there is no stretch to this dress and the material is not very breathable. Bustier girls should probably avoid this style.","25-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tie-front-floral-midi?color=049","mdalton","Tight fitting top!","This dress is so cute and very flattering but the top part is very tight. Like raising my arms to the side is very difficult. I have a very flat chest and narrow shoulders so I would size up in the dress in the future, when I typically would not.","20-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tie-front-floral-midi?color=049","Tarynkaye","Great versatile dress","Thought this was a lovely dress to wear during the day, and for a nice casual night out! I felt like the elastic in the arm bands were a little tight, but would be interested in renting again in the next size up. Posting the only pic I have of it, from a distance and from the back- but hey I love seeing pics so I’ll post what I have!","18-Nov-2019"

It is so adorable in person and I received many compliments! I will say it does wrong a tad small in the shoulder/bust area; I also have broader shoulders. I wear an xs/s and have a 34B bust area and the it was a bit tight around the bust. I would recommend sizing up IF you want a loose fit. Overall, I loved wearing this dress and it is so cute!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

Dress was lightweight and kept me cool and was able to move in it. Tighter around bust and torso area and then flares out. I really like the print and cut of this dress as well. Can be dressed up with wedges or worn casually with sneakers and a cropped jean jacket.","7-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tie-front-floral-midi?color=049","msmegxx","Extremely tight","Beautiful dress but I could barely get it on and felt claustrophobic once I did get it on. The material has absolutely no give. I also found the length to be a bit awkward on me (it hit a few inches below the knee). Not quite maxi but not really midi either. Print and balloon sleeves are fun though. I wish it would have worked out.","9-Aug-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tie-front-floral-midi?color=049","AmandaA","Fabric","I really wanted to love this dress! The print and silhouette look so cute on the model. The fabric also looks very light and airy. In person, the fabric is thicker than I had expected. And unfortunately the fit is too tight in the wrong places - something that the image does not portray. I rented in my normal size and was disappointed to find it almost impossible to get over my head.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/perfect-place-dress?color=066","kkshops","Cute Dress, Poor Fit","Got this dress to wear for an anniversary dinner but unfortunately the fit was very off. The neckline/chest situation was quite odd fitting and the hemline was extremely short.","11-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/perfect-place-dress?color=066","SLDP","Strange Fit","This dress is so pretty, I love the color. However, the fit was so strange. I never wore the dress because the fit was so uncomfortable and also short. I would definitely size up.","29-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/perfect-place-dress?color=066","hadden","Uhhm no","WOW. I can not explain how many ways this dress did not work for me. I am taller than average (but not that tall), and my butt (any other things) were completely showing in this dress. It looks great in the photos, but didn't translate in person at least for me.","11-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/perfect-place-dress?color=066","lemon14","a unique dress but","I liked the idea of this dress but it just didn’t work out for me. I wore it as a top with jeans rather than a dress (hello cold weather). one of the sleeves begins at the end of the shoulder and it kept falling down so I had to wear it differently just so I wouldn’t have to readjust every minute. It’s open in the front so you can’t wear a bra with it and throughout the night I had to make sure there weren’t any nipslips. I’m a size small and it did fit a little tight.","20-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/perfect-place-dress?color=066","amyelizabeth","Gorgeous dress but sleeves are weird","This is such a great dress for any day party, but I wish it fit better. Both sleeves were a little short on me (I’m on the taller side) and one sleeve kept falling off my shoulder. Body of the dress for me perfectly though.","3-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/perfect-place-dress?color=066","aoc","Super cute! but also super specific fit.","Wore this with sneakers to tone it down a little. few things to note -Very short on me (tall girl here) the arm width circumference runs a little smaller than most i'd say and the slice cut out panel on the bust was a little fussy- it is lined BUT photographs great, looks amazing on, tons of compliments","5-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/perfect-place-dress?color=066","jj276","Cute but small","I sized up and this was still too small.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/perfect-place-dress?color=066","AllieBucci","Very Cute Style, but for a limited audience","I loved this dress, and was excited to try it. I was disappointed to put it on and have it not fit. I'm very curvy on the bottom, so I always size up when looking at fitted items but this runs small. It was VERY short (it did not pass the sit test), and very fitted on the bottom. I would say if you have a curvy bottom, skip it. Wish I could have worn it though, cause the top is adorable!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I’m curvy so since this had a cinch waist I got the 31. But it sadly ran small (I think due to the cut). Glad I got to try it because it made me realize the straight leg cut is def not for me. Would definitely recommend for non-curvy folks.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I am normally a 29 but the 30 was in stock so I figured I would try it. I think they're a true 30, since they were a bit large on me, but were fine with a belt.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vintage-levis-orange-tab-jeans?color=093","Amybrew","Size 26","I measured the waistband of these and they’re 13” across or a modern size 26 with no stretch. They’re really cute! Cropped and flared, and made my butt look good. Just be aware of the sizing. I wore these with fringed booties and a tee, and also with a leather jacket.","4-Feb-2020"

In fact, they were a little snug, especially since I normally am a size 26 or 27 in jeans, but I sized up since these were rigid. These were ankle length on me (I'm 5'1""), so they would be cropped on most people. They were high rise, slim through the leg with a flare at the bottom. I got a lot of compliments...considering purchasing these!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
