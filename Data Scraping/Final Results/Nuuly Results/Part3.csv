"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nicola-jumpsuit?color=040","JaneMarie","Fun year round jumpsuit","I listened to the reviews and ordered a size up. Normally I am a size 0 so I ordered a size 2 BUT I realized after, there was a petite option and that would have been the best fit for me at 5’2”! The straps are a little long as well as the torso section, so the crotch area has some extra fabric, but not enough for anyone else to notice or to stop me from wearing it. I have to say this jumpsuit is super comfortable and once I put it on, I felt put together for a social event and also free enough to do any activity. Great for a long day of wear to take from day to night. The fabric is on the thicker side and has great stretch while maintaining its structured look. If I would have ordered the right size, I definitely would have purchased.","14-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nicola-jumpsuit?color=040","Booty","Perfect for pear shape","I'm a 6p in pants and a 2p (34A) in tops, so I tried this in 6p and it fit perfectly! The strips accross the front held in my puffy mom tummy, and the wide legs looked great with my bubble booty, so I bought it. It looks great with or without a shirt underneath, so I could wear this to work too!","9-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nicola-jumpsuit?color=040","CFith","Denim Jumpsuit","Wish this would have worked! The fabric is really nice, but it was just way too big everywhere. I normally wear a 0-2, but probably should have ordered a 00p in this.","8-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nicola-jumpsuit?color=040","VeryVA","Runs small but soooo cute on those it fits","Maybe it’s the cut, so a size up would have been the right play here. I was flying blind with no reviews. My fifteen year old daughter tried it on and it fit her like a glove. She is 5’3” and 117lbs with a lean, athletic body. It was tight in the lower body and certainly tight in the belly on me. I can go between a 2-4 and xs to s. I rely on your reviews to decide. I’m in that peri-menopausal time of my life so my body is just doing whatever it wants. My suggestion would be that you prepare yourself for a fitted jumpsuit with no give. Size up if you have any problem areas you don’t want to accentuate. If you get the right fit, you will absolutely turn heads. This one is a keeper!","3-May-2020"

However, once I tried to get them on it felt like I had ordered two sizes too small. I'm going to send these back and size up because otherwise these would be perfect. The linen material feels great and would be perfect for summer, the color is great and I love the tortoiseshell button. If you are considering these and have a pretty straight figure like me (as opposed to an hourglass shape) I'd definitely size up one or two sizes since the waist on these does not have a lot of give/stretch.","30-Apr-2020"

I usually like my t-shirts in medium so they're loose and roomy, but I got this one in small and it was HUGE! The short sleeves almost reached my elbows and the shoulder seams were a full four inches off my shoulders.

I ordered this before any reviews were up to saw otherwise. I am typically an XS or S in tops and ordered a S, but this S fit like a large. I don't know if an XS would even fit me properly- so unless you want it to be super relaxed/boxy or have a big chest, then i would go down 1 or even 2 sizes if you want it to fit like shown on the model. The shirt is beautiful however (hence the 4 stars) and I do wish the fit was better for me so that I could wear it confidently.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I like the longer length, sleeves, and wrap-style. It's perfect for a languid summer night. However, like some reviewers said, it DOES sort of look like one of those Asian robes. The fabric is NOT breathable at all, and I was expecting this to be a work-appropriate dress for summer. But if I'm sweating all the time, that's a problem! The price was too high for me to consider keeping it, especially since there were a couple other things in my nuuly that i LOVED, but it was fun to wear a couple of times.","6-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/twenty-one-hoodie?color=014","KCS","Stylish, Not Quite Comfy","I liked this one, though it's definitely made for style rather than comfort. It's a stiffer, almost neoprene-like fabric that, while it looks dressier and chic, is a little chilly against the skin and doesn't move as well with you as a traditional knit sweatshirt. That said, the color is great for warmer weather, and I was surprised at how it didn't wash me out; it's a good shade of beige, a little cooler than the photo shows. The sporty graphic stripes on the sides give it a streetwear edge. I would have preferred a more oversized fit, so if you want that look then go up a size, as it's cut fairly straight with a tighter band at the bottom. Altogether, I liked this one, and it's great with leggings and sneakers!","13-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/twenty-one-hoodie?color=014","sisigoesplaces","Nice hoodie, nothing special","I liked the material of this, it was nice and soft. It's more yellow in person than in the photo, and the neck line runs really high so I didn't wear it as much as I thought I would. The model is pulling it down but if your hands aren't in the pockets, the neck line basically goes to your chin. Oversized so size down if you aren't going for that look!","5-May-2020"

I wore it a few different ways: over a tie-dye dress in similar colors, over jeans and t-shirt, over PJs, and over a purple knit dress. I think it works best over something simple and plain so that the pattern can steal the show. It's not sheer, but on me it only *just* closed in the front with no overlap. You should size up if you want it to wrap in the front. I'm 5'8"" and the length hit me about 3"" above my ankle. The colors and patterns are magnificent. Definitely something special.","2-May-2020"

There are shoulder pads in this shirt which would be sooo cute if it fit, but in a size too large I felt like a dainty football player.

The top isn't as see-through because of the double-layer, but it has a swiss dot texture so it's uncomfortable and scratchy if you don't wear a bra.

I was excited for them because I love mustard/golden shades and liked the cut of the pants.

The material is not worth the retail price but is worth the nuuly price. The fit and colors are awesome. I do wish the fringe was double sided and not plain on the back. Overall this is completely adorable.","2-May-2020"
