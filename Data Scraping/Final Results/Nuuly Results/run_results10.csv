I didn't wear it because it looks too ""worn"" for my taste. I guess it would've been fine for a night out. Sadly--quaratine.","15-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","Lunabelle","Fun and easy to wear","I dressed this up and down with shoes/boots and was so comfortable wearing it everywhere. The shape plus stretchy material flattered my curves. I was tempted to keep, but because I'm 6 months pregnant, I wasn't sure if the size and style would still work later in my pregnancy or post partum. I will definitely order again.","11-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","Charis","Heavy fabric lays well","I loved this dress. Thick fabric for warmth but wasn't bulky. Wore with black boots and tights. Very comfortable and the buckle detail is a nice touch.","11-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","HomeStylist","Size down","I wish I had sized down on this one. I think I would have loved it if I had, but it was too large in the waist. Thankfully it had a belt and and I was able to move the gathers to the back, but I didn’t fee like a million bucks in it.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","kgreen","Sweater dress","Cut is more flattering than most sweater dresses, with an a line fit. Wish I had gotten a 4, was able to fold some excess fabric and hide with the belt.","10-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","Jurga","Versatile and comfortable black dress","I wore it by itself with cognac ankle booties, and a second time with a short light grey denim jacket + pink suede combat boots. It fit well, the material was soft, breathable, pleasant to the touch. I loved the cut of the sleeves and the knee length.","5-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","jilliancrowley","Classy","I wore this dress with black tights and patterned booties and got so many compliments!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","thealanimal","beautifully made, but not for me","This looked really nice on the model and I really wanted to love it because it's very well made but didn't look good on me at all. Went with a medium, maybe if I'd gone down a size it could've worked? Hard to say. I'm 5'6 w/an 'hour-glass' shape and it just looked really unflattering on me. Think it would definitely work on a taller/skinnier woman. Even tried wearing heeled boots and heels but nothing fixed how big and boxy it looked!","28-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","ac98rover","Classic","Runs a bit big, especially in the hips. Nice blousey sleeves add a touch of character to this standard black dress. Wore to work and received compliments.","28-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","pgbrid","almost perfect but ""hippie""","Bunches up somewhat around the hips due to cinching at the belted waist, but I moved that fabric to the back of the dress and it's fine. My waist is typically one size smaller than my hips. Has a slick lining that allows you wear tights under without the tights sticking to the dress fabric.","27-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","MaggieRae","Just meh.....","This dress fits well and it's a good substantial fabric but it's just kind of boring. I wore it once and didn't feel amazing in it...just like I was wearing a plain black dress.","27-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","beancall","Just okay","I didn't end up wearing this as it was overwhelming on my petite frame. I probably could have made it work, but the extra fabric was bothersome.","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/little-black-belted-sweater-dress?color=001","BurlapNLace","Not flattering","Nice material but bunches in weird spots and adds several pounds. Couldn't make it work.","24-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/polka-dot-tiered-dress?color=010","laurapur","Frumpy nightgown","This dress was not what I expected. The material has a sheen and metallic gold threading and just looks like a frumpy nightgown. I had hoped to wear this to a work event but did not wear it anywhere.","13-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/polka-dot-tiered-dress?color=010","cringhand","Awkward fit in the chest","This dress fit me everywhere but the chest was very loose. It does not stretch at all and has a peasant dress fit to it. I thought it would be tighter around my waist than it is. I still liked the dress but it fit funny in the chest and was not super flattering.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/polka-dot-tiered-dress?color=010","HannahM","Size Down","This dress was too big on me so I don't think I got a fair assessment of it. The tiers are nice and the fabric is good quality. It just sort of hung off of me so I think if I got this again I'd order the M.","3-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/polka-dot-tiered-dress?color=010","Tokyo","Beautiful!","I got this piece for fun, but I ended up really loving it! Wore it to work many times. I love the polka dots and bit of sparkle it has in the stripes. Give it a try, it's great for Spring, or layer with black for winter.","29-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/polka-dot-tiered-dress?color=010","ESE31","Love this dress!!","I rented this for my baby shower and sized up. At 8 months pregnant it fit great (it is not a maternity dress!) would be a closet staple for any event pregnant or not- great fit, super comfortable and so chic!!","27-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/polka-dot-tiered-dress?color=010","drewacker","Not for large chested women!!!","This is a gorgeous dress but it did not fit my chest AT ALL, and I ordered my normal size. Big disappointment :(","12-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/polka-dot-tiered-dress?color=010","g_lee","FYI","FYI, I never wore this dress because the image is actually a bit misleading. You don't see that there is gold trim everywhere on this dress (see uploaded photo), which gives it a different look/feel than what you (or at least I could) see online. Otherwise, I think the fit overall is true to size, though a bit long. Definitely not for shorter petites unless you're okay with it being longer than your average midi dress. The dress is pretty, but with the gold trim, the satiny shimmer, and length, it is less casual than I had thought it would be.","6-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/petal-maxi-dress?color=066","Rachelantonia","""Like a Flower made of Flowers""","Agree with other reviews here--it's slightly too well made to be casual, but also not well made enough to be formal. I have a pretty decent bust (32D/34D) and it still wanted to fall off! That would have been forgivable, but I did not enjoy the tiered way the skirt was made--It added weight and made me feel like a wedding cake.","11-May-2020"

This shirt was unfortunately way too long and bulky on me. I was also a little surprised that the material was just average t-shirt materiel - I was expecting more of a cotton poplin type fabric. Overall, this might work for taller ladies, but not for me! :)","6-Feb-2020"

I say it's true to size because it's meant to be a little slouchy so I went with an XS (sometimes I can be on the spectrum of XS-S so if you are, go with your smaller size). It was cute tucked in in the front and the bright pink is actually a super flattering color. It's warm but not too hot. Helped me hide my early pregnancy bump a bit too.","3-Apr-2020"

Material was thick, comfortable, and fell just right. (Side note, I’m much taller than average). Ran slightly large but in the best way (usually take a medium and the small was perfect).

Material was thick, comfortable, and fell just right. (Side note, I’m much taller than average). Ran slightly large but in the best way (usually take a medium and the small was perfect).

It looks sooo good with a pair of dark skinnies and boots. Obsessed. But also... how often can you wear a BRIGHT orange/red (there’s some debate as to color) sweater? Material was thick, comfortable, and fell just right. (Side note, I’m much taller than average). Ran slightly large but in the best way (usually take a medium and the small was perfect).

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/constantine-midi-dress?color=038","AmandaPattison","Wonderful Work/Travel/Anytime Dress","This print is so unique, which was originally what drew me to it. I love the fabric, it's lightweight and comfortable. It's a bit long on me (I'm 5'5) but uneven cut of the hem doesn't make the longer length unflattering at all. I know from experience with this brand that a 4P would have made the waist hit too high on me, and I actually tried on a size 2 instore and found it to be a bit too tight under my arms. I ordered a size 4 (normally a 2 or 4 depending on the store), and it was a touch big, but this is meant to be more flowy, and the belt hides the larger waist. I am planning on starting a family in the next few years and am currently expanding my work wardrobe, so I figured I would eventually get more wear out of the slightly larger size. I LOVE that it has pockets. This is perfect.","6-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/constantine-midi-dress?color=038","RJ","light, breezy","I ordered this in a petite because I'm short and thought it could work. The hem length was great and the cut through the body fit well except a bit snug in bust area. Where it did not fit were the upper arms, although the sleeves were still too long and very billowy from just above the elbow down. I'm not exceptionally disproportionate in my arms so I think the sleeves are cut very straight, and my arms are just not. The pattern is cute, but the dress is very lightweight and tends to wrinkle. Also, the striping under the bust area can highlight imperfections so beware if you have a tummy or the bust is too snug. I don't think it's worth trying again in the standard size.","1-Mar-2020"

It is an incredibly fun pattern and the cut out in the front and back were cute without being over the top.

Pretty substantial fabric, and the front ties so you can adjust to your preferred fit. There was a lot of extra fabric for my flat chest, but others might not have that problem.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/maggie-tie-front-mini-dress?color=040","SaraMat","Sizing up was not the move","I sized up to a medium because I don’t like things being snug but this was way too loose. I never felt like I was going to fall out even without a bra/tape/pasties, but it kept drooping lower as the night went on. The ties cover the opening which I liked and the pockets are great. Loved the color and it was a funky/unique style. Would have preferred a more fitted fit that I would have likely gotten had I stuck with the small. Wore with sandals. Length was short without being revealing.","25-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/speckled-print-blouse?color=020","tarynpen","Perfect for a night out","This top was so cute! Unfortunately I didn't get the chance to wear it out (thanks corona lol) but tried it on a couple times and could 100% see myself renting again and wearing it frequently. It's the perfect top to throw on with jeans and booties for dinner/drinks. Really easy to style and would look good with white jeans for spring/summer or black jeans for winter/fall. The fit was comfortable and you could adjust the sleeves a bit which is really nice because the puffy shoulders can be unflattering for some body types. The adjustable straps allow you to have control over that and really tailor it to suit your body type. The sizing was pretty true to size and I found the small to be really comfortable. If you're usually between sizes, I would say size up for a bigger chest and down for a small chest. The bodice has some give to it but don't know how comfy it would be for girls with a bigger chest so that could be something to consider.","24-Apr-2020"

I usually wear a 4/6 and I saw the reviews which said they run small so I got the 6 and they fit but probably would go for an 8 if I were to rent again (which I think I would). They're very high waisted and because of this the little bit of a tummy I have felt like it was bulging. Perhaps a bigger size would help since it wouldn't be so tight on the waist and they're also tight on the thighs so it just looked a little funny on me. Might even size up further to a 10.

I ended up sizing up and really wish I got them in my normal size a 4 or maybe even a 2. I will probably try them again bc they are really amazing pants. I paired the pants with the Alice McAll white puffy shirt and it paired well. I got so many complements on them. I didn’t wear them for long periods outside because the length of the pants I didn’t wanna ruin the bottoms. They were perfect for a fashion trade show. Heels are probably required. Will make awesome summer or spring pants.","19-Feb-2020"

I ordered this dress in a 2 and it fits perfectly. It has ZERO stretch. But I had no problem zipping it up and I’m a 32D. It is a bit long waisted, which is ideal for me as I have a long torso- but just something to keep in mind. The details, fabric, and cut are just beautiful. I have gotten compliments every time I have worn it. I think it is a 4 season dress- it’s light weight but can easily be paired with black tights, boots& a cardigan. The colors are lovely and neutral. Honestly my favorite piece I have rented from Nuuly!","11-Feb-2020"

They ARE loose, but without making me feel like I have no figure. They are long enough for my long legs--shorter people will probably have to roll them. The denim is very good quality.","5-Mar-2020"

I read other reviews and ordered 2 sizes up as recommended (I’m usually a 10), but the sizing was still too strange. It felt somewhat tight on my bust (I’m a 36C for reference), but felt too large everywhere else (maybe I should’ve only ordered 1 size up?) I’m also tall (5’11) and found that this dress cut me off in an unflattering part of my legs. Furthermore, I’m pretty pale and found that the barely pink color of this dress REALLY washed me out. I tried this dress on in front of my boyfriend, who said it looked like I was wearing my grandma’s nightgown. While his fashion sense is usually questionable, I actually agreed with him on this one! Safe to say this piece stayed in my box all month, and I will not be ordering it again.

Other than the unflattering length, the rest of the design is super sleek. Plus pockets! If you're shorter/more petite this could work and be really fun. The full body strip is cool. Fabric is really stretchy/comfy.","7-Apr-2020"

Only concern is I normally wear a small but I like when things are a little bit oversized. The problem was I got a medium and the arms are very long and its pretty baggy. I normally wear small but might even wanna downsize to an XS just to be safe. I think a size down would still be an oversized look. Other than that this jacket is to die for! So comfy and very nice.

I agree with past reviews that if I had sized up to 6, the ruffles would have over taken me... They are BIG.
