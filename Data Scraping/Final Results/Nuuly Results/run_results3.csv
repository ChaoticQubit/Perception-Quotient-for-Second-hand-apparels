What didn't work was the low v cut and the poof sleeves (it doesn't look like that in the model picture). The fabric was not soft cotton but rather stiff. If between sizes I would size down..which I did and still felt it was not fitting properly.","1-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/midsummer-sleeveless-maxi?color=065","ljospam3","This dress makes me feel like a princess","This is the very best dress I have ever worn. I am a true size 20/22 on my bottom half, but a size 14/16 on my top half, so finding dresses that work for me can be really impossible. This dress fits like a DREAM. It is so soft, so flowy, and so flattering. I can definitely understand why some folks reviewed that it was tight in the waist/bust. If I had a ""normal"" plus size bust, there is no way this would fit me. But my full B cups fit fine, and I think it would probably work for up to a full C or small D in the 20W size. It is very long, which also works for me. I'm 5'9"" and it skims the floor when I'm barefoot. I love this dress so much that I'm just constantly wearing it around the house during quarantine. And trying to convince myself that I don't need to shell out the $350+ to own it forever.","12-May-2020"

It is a bit short and my belly button showed even with high rise jeans. I wore on the deck when it was a bit warm and I noticed I had a bit of a sweat mark. Wish it was just a teeny bit longer and I would buy even just for home use.","18-Apr-2020"

I’m quarantining away from my house and clothes so I just had nuuly send me good basics & I’m so glad I did because I’m obsessed with this shirt. The size chart is weird because it’s a 1,2 or 3. I got a 2 and usually wear a medium and it fit perfect. This shirt is fun because it’s so cute with leggings and tennis shoes, jeans & wedges or even a skirt. Big fan! Will probably buy it!","7-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/leah-twist-front-ss-top?color=054","MaryMchitown","Soft, great color, a bit casual","Cute top! The fabric is really soft. It’s hard for me to find crop tops that aren’t too short - this was a great compromise (short in the front, longer in the back). The draping is flattering, it helps that the fabric is a nice heavier weight. This almost feels like athleisure - i could wear it to yoga, except the fabric is a little thick for that! Would rent it again.","4-Apr-2020"

My husband *adored* this, and I felt good when I looked in the mirror as well. It is slimming, and very versatile. It looks cute with either a patterened or single color top. I didn't feel like it accentuated my wide hips, and it ended at my upper thigh. Ended up buying the piece!","7-May-2020"

(Perhaps this aspect would have been less pronounced in a smaller size?) Also, it wrinkles easily so prepare to give it a steam if you're not into the rumpled look.","26-Apr-2020"

I chose this due to the fact that we are under stay at home orders and wanted something pretty to wear around the house. It was definitely great for that, but I’m sure it would be a lot more fun to wear as a coverup on vacation! I only deduct one star because it is quite long for short people. I’m 5’3’’ and almost tripped on it a few times.","13-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lima-long-robe?color=049","ElizabethVC","So chic and comfortable","I wore this for some quarantine flair, and got so many compliments (via Zoom meetings). This is way too expensive to consider buying I would definitely rent it again, especially when I can go out into the world! It feels very luxe to wear it around the house. I wore it over a slip dress and over jeans and a tee. Very versatile and nice fabric.","8-May-2020"

I'm 5'9"" and the jeans went just beyond skimming the floor. Couldn't wear with heels, but could wear with 2"" cowgirl booties and have them touch the ground or close to it. I'm typically a 27, but in these I could have gone with a 26 as the denim definitely loosens up - not sure if that would change the inseam though.","13-May-2020"

Even if I was 6, they would be too long. So confusing because I'd gladly buy them and hem them-but can't see how to hem them with the applique.Hoping they make another round that are not so out of touch with the length because the quality is great.

I'm 5'9"" and the jeans went just beyond skimming the floor. Couldn't wear with heels, but could wear with 2"" cowgirl booties and have them touch the ground or close to it. I'm typically a 27, but in these I could have gone with a 26 as the denim definitely loosens up - not sure if that would change the inseam though.","13-May-2020"

I'm short so this is about 2-3 inches too long on me. Also in the boob area it was tight. Wish it would have fit better.","6-May-2020"

It was super comfortable and I got a lot of compliments on it. It has pockets, which I love. If you're short, go with the petite sizing as the length was perfect on me and I'm 5'2"".","7-Apr-2020"

I did order the petite and it hits just right but if you are shorter than 5' 2' it will probably be too long. Will order again in the LP.","26-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/norma-denim-longline-jacket?color=092","joelledweisser","Cool, laid back vibes","I took a guess that this would run large (no reviews yet) and ordered a small (typically medium) and was right. Small fit perfect. It is fitted in the arms though, so if that's a problem for you maybe stick with your normal size. It's a cool, well made jacket. I wore it in the midst of social distancing so it saw lots of walks, short hikes, and grocery store action but even so I got lots of compliments and felt put together even in leggings while wearing it.","23-Mar-2020"
