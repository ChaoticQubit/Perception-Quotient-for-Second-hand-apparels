"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gigi-sparkly-mid-rise-flare-pants?color=001","Moreuhhhh","Cute but small!","Too small! Super cute but the fit was way too tight. Couldn’t wear! Usually a M in urban pants or a 28/29.","19-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gigi-sparkly-mid-rise-flare-pants?color=001","Danifoofoo","Perfect pant If you hate jeans","These are so fun! I had to buy them. My job is very active and I’m always looking for a cool denim alternative. I styled them with a long sleeved graphic tee and my chunky Prada sneakers. Good butt pants!","7-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","Miho","Compliments!","Super eye-catching jacket and easy to throw on. I'm tall and have long arms so the sleeves were a bit short on me, but I was wearing the jacket in warm weather so I just rolled the sleeves up. Has a bit of a boxy fit.","24-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","victoriainsf","Fabulous","I got the most mileage out of this item in my box and loved dressing it up or down! So many compliments too! It only loses a star for lack of pockets.","16-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","Hunose13","Loved so much I bought it!","This jacket is so unique and different. Looked great both dressed up over a black crepe jumpsuit as well as with a white tshirt and jeans! LOVE and so many compliments every time I wear it!","14-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","Ashdash113","Great print, hard to style","This jacket was so cute- loved the material! Great construction as well. But it was really hard to style. The jacket was a little too long on me and the fabric was a little delicate for long term wear so I only ended up wearing it once to a work happy hour thing.","7-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","aginghipster","I wanted to love this...","This runs really large. It's poofy and stiff, so it just didn't fall right. I think I will order it again but maybe go down 1 or 2 sizes. So fun and bright, though!","6-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","ElizaJ","A cutie for sure","I really liked this. It's such a cute statement. I wore this out and I wore it to church. Each time, I paired it with a black top and either jeans or leather leggings. It's definitely not a warm jacket, so keep that in mind.","2-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","katiejay","So pretty","This jacket is very pretty and can add a lot to the right outfit. I got a XS which was a little narrow in the shoulders for me, but I made it work. A small would have fit better.","25-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","lcollins40","Bright bomber !","Love this. Wire over black tank and pants, over a denim shirt and over a black dress. It can be dressed up or down. I got tons of compliments on it.","21-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","Tfro","A fabulous statement jacket","I received so many compliments on this bomber. I wore it during so many occasions - dressed up with a black slip dress, dressed down with black jeans and a white basic tee. Very versatile!","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","on4nineteen","Sleeves are very short","Hard to tell in the model photo because she has bent arms but the sleeves were way too short. I couldn't wear it. Looked ridiculous.","19-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","lek24","Fun but a bit much","This jacket was beautiful but it's a bit much - the red is very vibrant and the gold is very sparkly/bright. I ended up wearing it only once because I felt it was too aggressive for work/everyday wear.","9-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","blissful","Pretty, runs large","Beautiful and distinct looking bomber jacket. I may have loved it if I had gone down a size. As it is, it poufs out in the back making me look larger than I am.","7-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","KatyJo","CUTEST. jacket. EVER.","Put this in your closet. This jacket works with everything. And I don’t think I’ve ever received more compliments — from absolute strangers — on an item of clothing in my life.","5-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","Limitz18","Make a statement!","This jacket was amazing. I wore it with black everything and it was such a great statement piece. It’s not very warm but I loved it.","25-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","BigBluBoo","Luxe fabric","The fabric on this jacket is amazing! It runs large but I did wear it once. You wont have any worries about it fitting over a sweater or other bulky tops. I usually like jackets with no collar, but this felt a bit unfinished...","9-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/metallic-floral-bomber?color=069","ezthetic","Gorgeous","Due to my freakishly long arms, this didn't fit me in particular. However, I was able to try on a different size (long story, 2XL did the trick for my 6'4"" wingspan tho) and when the sleeves were long enough for me, I felt like a million bucks. The metallic fabric really stands out, yet is somehow simultaneously subtle, and the floral design is really beautiful. I got more compliments on this one than I could count!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","Baer","SO CUTE","I absolutely loved this coat, but I had it during the COVID season so I never got to wear it. :( It's so pretty, warm and comfortable, maybe next winter I'll get it again so I can actually wear it","15-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","cait","Soft and slouchy in all the right ways","The photo made me a little apprehensive that this could be a little stiff or ""vintage"" feeling. ON THE CONTRARY, it's actually got a very modern, relaxed fit. The texture is a little fuzzy, and very soft. As soon as I took this pink plaid coat out of the bag I wanted to wear it around the house!","31-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","asasas25","Very Oversized, But SO CUTE!","I wore this coat a lot, but it was VERY oversized as other reviews said. I usually get a 2X in coats because I have wide shoulders, but I ordered a 1X. The 1X was still way big and I wish I would have gone down another size. I still got tons of compliments though!","13-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","Ashdash113","Cute print","The pattern on this coat was really cute so I tried really hard to make it work but it really eclipsed me because it was so big. Also, the lining was so hard to manage and crawled with every step I took, causing the shape of the coat to look super weird.","7-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","karinaschmitt","Amazing Coat","I loved this coat and got so many compliments, beware it runs SUPER large.","5-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","afancyflamingo","Strawberry shortcake","I loved this coat so much and was sad when I had to return it. It was girly but in a grown up way. I wore it with jeans, skirts, and dresses. I got so many compliments particularly from women. I recommend sizing down at least one size. I could have even gone down two but I enjoyed the oversized fit.","1-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","Jessybird","Pretty but not for me","The shoulder seam sits low down your arm which just makes the beautiful coat seem frumpy or like it doesn’t fit properly. Also everything falls out of the pockets constantly","21-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","mesolimbic","Cute 1970s vibe coat","So cute! Unfortunately I live in a climate where a cost like this is not useful, but it was fuzzy and fun. It was more of a statement cost than I thought it would be - it was pinker than I assumed. But still adorable.","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","TMI","Runs very large","Sad I won’t get a chance to wear this coat. Super cute but runs way to big even an xs wouldn’t fit.","13-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","retrobettie","Runs Very Large","I rarely get to write this, but this item was WAY oversized. I wear a 2X in nearly everything, including coats, and this coat fit me like a 4X. It was huge all over and I tried it with a belt, but it was still unflattering. So sad because it's such an adorable coat!","7-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","Iamsmith","Going to miss this jacket!","This one was so fun! Loved wearing it and got so many compliments. Even with the oversized style - It runs big I would suggest sizing down.","3-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","AlexandraMD","Would buy immediately","I got so many compliments on this coat! The oversized fit is exactly what I was going for and it's really soft. Only downside is that it's pretty thin and definitely wasn't warm enough for January in NYC.","30-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","Kkvance","Cute, but runs really large","This is a fun, cute coat. The buttons are adorable! Unfortunately, it runs pretty big!","27-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","SRain23","LOVEEEE","This coat is seriously so so perfect. I got so many compliments when I wore this. Honestly considering purchasing it! Runs a little large but that’s sort of how it’s supposed to look.","23-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","mkh615","Super cute jacket!","This jacket was super cute, and the buttons were an unexpected great detail! I will say it definitely runs large and wish I would've gone down a size, and it was a much lighter material than expected.","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","Torianne","Bold flirty coat","It is a tad oversized in the best way! High quality coat you will want to keep","16-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","pinkpinetrees","Really Cute","This is really cute and has fun vintage 60s vibes, especially with a dress. The only reason its not five stars for me is my own fault - I for some reason really felt that I needed to size up so I could wear this with chunky sweaters. You do not need to do this, it is already the good kind of oversized.","9-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strawberry-plaid-coat?color=015","_jjjjo_","Size down","So cute but I could have fit another person inside with me. Would recommend going down a size at least in plus sizes.","3-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tricia-sweatshirt?color=001","Jolill","Size down","I wore this 3x’s a week I think! Normally I regret listening to the sizing advice in posts but this was spot on. I’m a true medium and hate tight stuff. The small fit perfectly-below my hips, sleeves could be cuffed or not, still loose. Looks just like the model. The embroidery is lovely.","11-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tricia-sweatshirt?color=001","txcottagemama","Cute & Comfy","I wore this comfy sweatshirt almost everyday and yet somehow I didn’t get a picture - so here’s a live video screen shot- I got a small but if I rent it again I’ll get an XS.","10-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","Amiright_edie","Looked like a sweater, nope!","It was really more of a tee - and thin. Just not as robust as I thought it was.","2-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","CLENu","Good basic","Bought this. Good to have a black tee on hand - and this one punches up the basic black tee. I didn't have issues with the puff sleeves like others.","27-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","scorpion","T-shirt fabric and the shoulders wont stay puffed like in the picture","Its just like a regular long sleeve shirt material. Its cute to try something different but the shoulders dont stay up like in the picture. They kept flopping and it looked bad.","25-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","hilaryjane","Shoulders are very poofy whereas the rest of the sleeve is tight.","I guess it might have looked better if I sized up, but the poof on the sleeve is just too abrupt. It would have looked much better with a more generally billow-y sleeve that had an extra poof on the shoulder.","24-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","shannon0011","Just EH","The fabric was NOT what I expected at all. It's basically just a cotton t-shirt. It's not bad but I definitely wouldn't choose this over the hundreds of other cuter options Nuuly has to offer.","23-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","KT01","Too much puff","I’m an 8/10 and these sleeves were so puffy it was too much volume over all.","17-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","Winner","Kind of frumpy","I tucked this into paper bag pants and the look was ok. It’s a cotton material that looks washed a few too many times. The puffy elbows don’t stand up and instead look a little frumpy. Definitely a casual and unpolished look.","16-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","KBforLyfe","Perfect amount of puff","Some styles with puff shoulders really be doing the most but this shirt is perfect. So easy to match with things I wore it in at least 5 different combos.","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","SJ","Great basic with a little extra pizzazz","This top was comfortable and cute. It makes a great basic black top and the sleeves give it just a little something extra. My only issue is that the sleeve length was a little bit short for me.","4-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","LittleDino","wide in the torso but the sleeves are perfect","i love the puff sleeves. the torso was wider so if you tuck this shirt in, it takes away from the bodysuit/clean/fitted look unless i pull the seams for the arm pit as far in as possible, if that makes sense? otherwise it made me look like i had wings. might have just been the way it fit me but it just bunched too easily to look clean on me","26-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","SofiaM","Comfortable but frumpy","The material of this shirt is just like a t-shirt, so very soft and a little slouchy, which is great for comfort, but it made the ""puff"" sleeves sag and just gives an overall frumpy look. I ordered the small and still felt that it was a little oversized. The whole look came out baggy - I ended up wearing this more at home than out since it's so comfortable.","29-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","modernmama","All wrong","This shirt is strange. Looks cute on the model but on me the exagerated puffed sleeves were way too big and just drooped down in a floppy manner. Not the look I was going for.","28-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","ssl","Not my favorite","Felt really silly in this one so couldn't bring myself to ever wear it. Perhaps it looked costume-y on my short frame, but you've gotta have a more high-fashion look to pull this one off I think. Also just a cheap basic t-shirt material so not worth while to me.","27-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jones-puff-sleeve-top?color=001","jill_netz","Saggy shoulders","Cute idea, but something was off on the fit. I couldn't tell if it was because the item was worn / stretched or if the fit was just not right. The shoulders sagged and looked more like shoulder pads and than poofs.","25-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/joan-tie-top?color=000","BisForBridget","Cute & Comfy basic with a twist","I loved this top. If it was one size larger, I would have purchased it. I normally wear a small in tops, but got a medium, and probably could have used a large for a little additional length. It was cropped on me like the model, even with high waisted pants (I'm 5'9). The fabric was comfortable and it silhouetted me nicely. Even though it's a long sleeve tee, the addition of the tie made it feel more elevated.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/joan-tie-top?color=000","LitMajor","Hot crop top","I wore this on a couple dates in the winter and felt great in it :) The length is a little short (even for a crop top), so I wore it with a very high waisted skirt or very high waisted pants. It's sexy and stylish and I found you can wear the bow in the front or the back. Would rent again!","9-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/joan-tie-top?color=000","ashleyyb","Cute style but more cropped than expected","I liked the fit of this top, except that it was shorter than I expected. Even with high waisted jeans, I still felt like I was showing more stomach than I wanted. I did like it more with a blazer over it, but then the side tie detail was covered up. I never got it quite right so I never actually wore this out.","5-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ryan-fair-isle-sweater?color=090","HEKoko","Fun and flattering, despite the awkward fit","Okay, This sweater is a little awkward but I gave it 5 stars because I actually wore this a ton. We were traveling to the Oregon Coast and I wore it on the plane and at the ocean when it was raining. Super cute and fun colors! I’ve also worn it around the house with jeans, out to dinner with leggings and thrown it on with sweats for extra warmth. I ended up loving it but I really had to warm up to it. It’s constructed in two pieces. The top part (the neck to just below the shoulders) is one piece that kind of hugs into your upper arms and has a clear seam-like piece that separates it from the bottom portion of the sweater. It’s like if you imagine putting on one of those fake turtle neck things that people wore under sweaters in the 90s that is really only half a turtleneck...that’s like the top part of the sweater and where that part ends is tight like almost holding your arms down so you can’t really lift your arms overhead without it pulling the whole thing up awkwardly. I hope that explanation is helpful and not more confusing but it’s difficult to describe. Obviously the awkwardness wasn’t a deal breaker for me Bc I wore it a lot and got a ton of compliments. I just couldn’t lift my arms comfortably.","8-Mar-2020"

I would put it on and then take it off pretty soon after. I may have been a bit allergic to it because I had to always wear a long-sleeved shirt under it and then I would start to feel a little funny and take it off after a couple of hours. I did wear it on a hike and it was warm and I didn’t experience any funny feelings. Perhaps it was because of more ventilation. I received a compliment on it.","29-Feb-2020"

I wore it to just about every different place I could, and ended up just putting it on in the house as it was so warm. It's true to size, but there's a yoke around the neck that can get a little tricky if you size up but have a larger bust. Nothing a sports bra didn't fix to help it all lay better.","9-Jan-2020"

Every time I wore it I got several compliments, since the shimmer is very eye-catching. With that said, I felt that the quality was lacking. The material is very thin and the buttons felt flimsy. Also, this is mid-high-waisted, which I usually love, but since the material is so thin, the area directly below the button puffed out and made my lower belly look bulgy. I do have a bit of a pudge from my pregnancy (I am 3 months postpartum), but I do not have this issue with any other high-waisted pants.

In reality, the material is very cool looking, like an expensive, special piece, but they wrinkle pretty much immediately (and in a weird way because the thread is kind of like tinsel) and the waist area balloons in an unflattering way and pinches my waist uncomfortably.

It was more cropped on me than the model, but I do seem to have a slightly longer torso. For getting an XS I'd say it was a bit wider than anticipated (I'm a 30C / 24 waist for reference), but tucking the front into ultra high jeans made a big difference and was the only way I wore it.","17-Mar-2020"

It was also itchy and extremely cropped. Overall I still think the sweater is gorgeous, it just didn’t work out for me unfortunately.","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gardenia-sweater?color=011","CMC90","Nice sweater","I like the floral design of this sweater. As far as fit, it is cropped as well as boxy, so I sized down because I have a short torso and I’m not a fan of a boxy look. I put a tank underneath and was able to wear it to work. It was not itchy at all and I have very sensitive skin. So overall I like the sweater because of the floral design, but fit for me because of the box shape was just okay. I don’t regret getting it, it was good to wear to work for me.","8-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bardot-high-rise-flare-jeans?color=093","Momellen","Cute, but crazy long and heavy","I had been looking for a pair of vintage blue jeans like this for quite some time...unfortunately these just missed the mark. I appreciate that the denim is heavy and quality but with the crazy length and wide flare, it’s just so much material to lug around. They also run a bit big so I would recommend sizing down. The inseam on a 26 is 34.5” fyi...I’m a tall girl and I still don’t own heels high enough to wear these :(","30-Dec-2019"

They have super cute style details and fit great through the waist and thighs (true to size) however they were insanely long. I’m 5’6 and tried them on with a 5” heal and they still were puddled on the floor :( If you’re really tall I say totally go for them because they’re super cute.","29-Dec-2019"

However, with the weather improving and since being stuck at home, I’ve found myself being drawn more to bright colors, like this sweatshirt. Although bright, it’s certainly not neon which is something I appreciate. The texture is almost more terry-cloth like, but not itchy or rough (something very important to me as my skin is quite sensitive). I picture this being a perfect sweatshirt to wear on chilly summer nights, or a coverup at a pool or beach. I actually ended up loving this simple & sunny sweatshirt so much that I bought it!","16-Apr-2020"

Next to my no-makeup face I couldn't really bare it, even alone in my own house. Also I must say the hem felt a little dated, but in a cool luxe malibu mom way, which I tend to be fine with. So if you are into that- go for it! If you love yellow- it's awesome!","11-Apr-2020"

It's definitely an oversized coat and if you're petite it could potentially overpower in the shoulders/collar (I'm always worried about my head looking super small, ha!). Was pleasantly surprised that this coat was warmer than I expected! I rented in Jan/Feb in NYC and was worried the weather may not be mild enough, but in 40 degrees I was definitely warm enough wearing it! The shearling-esque material is a little pilled/clumped (so not super fuzzy soft) but it worked as part of the overall style and didn't feel oddly worn.","13-Feb-2020"

Looked smart and effortless with a red lip and glasses. Would also be great for a trip to India or other modest and warm trip. Ran a bit big even for my true xs petite frame, but the style is meant to be roomy and I received many compliments. Very stylish and effortless, would definitely rent again.","25-Feb-2020"

On my body (really long torso), though, my belly button did peek out often, even with high waisted jeans. It didn't bother me, but I would have to wear ultra high waist for that not to happen. It's super comfortable and interesting. The slit in the front makes it stand out from other button ups and other tunics. I wore it with high waisted skinny jeans and boots.","25-Feb-2020"

The neckline wasn't quite as relaxed as it looks in the photo, but wasn't uncomfortable or tight at all. I have a short torso so opted for the petite version and the fit was just right. A word of caution: like anything with a big/statement sleeve, this doesn't really fit into a coat nicely, so plan accordingly.","26-Feb-2020"

I only really wore them once, mainly because I didn't have any other occasion for them. I thought black looked the best with them since the red details were not shades I really had to match.

The billowy sleeves would've been fine if they hadn't slid right over my wrists and halfway down my hands. This is fine with hoodies—not so much with this garment!

It's great on the cold days and could probably be used as a jacket on more spring like days. The only negatives were it really could use pockets and it might be a little warm.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/work-it-tunic?color=001","H","Different and edgy","I wore this very cool tunic over jeans with Frye lace up combats. I love this piece because it’s so unique and different and kinda takes balls (for me, anyway) to wear. It can sort of come across as a bad-guy-in-a dark-movie cloak, type of thing, but I still love it. I love how long it is, I love the slit so the jeans peak out. It adds a nice warm layer that just feels fashionable. I ordered a medium, and probably could have gotten away with a small.","6-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/work-it-tunic?color=001","CindaRichardson","Love it, but crazy large","I had to check the label when I put this on - hard to believe this is just a medium. Sleeves cover my hands completely and pretty wide thru the torso. It also looks worn as if it’s stretched with wear. However I still loved the look with a lot of different bottoms so I am still considering buying it, but probably will buy it new from FP.","5-Dec-2019"

It was the most fun 70’s inspired outfit ever! I got so many compliments!! This top was really fun with all the colors and the tie sleeves. It is a crop top, though! I was glad to wore high waisted jeans!","23-Jan-2020"

It is sheer behind the sequins under the right light. If you don't like fussing with your clothes all night, be aware the ties on the sleeves come undone often. Only other issue is I didn't love the fit, because the torso is pretty shapeless, and cropped in an odd length for my height.","8-Jan-2020"
