"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sacha-jacquard-tiered-tunic2?color=001","Racine","Classic","This is a pretty dress for everyday. I ordered the Petite so it would be shorter, the length was good, but it was too tight in shoulders/chest. I'll go up a size if I get this again. I liked the fabric, it wasn't too heavy.","18-May-2020"

It seems well made and the print is beautiful, but the tunic was just too tight in the bust for me. I will be trying this in the next size!","13-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/norra-maxi-dress?color=011","AKdressup","disappointed with fit!","The dress looks beautiful on the hanger but once on it’s see through and looks too frumpy. Really baggy especially in the bust.","14-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/norra-maxi-dress?color=011","llaw","So cute! But unlined and see-through.","This dress is so flowy and a perfect weight for a hot summer day, but it is not lined so you can see right through the lower half (*especially when the sun hits it). The top isn't as see-through because of the double-layer, but it has a swiss dot texture so it's uncomfortable and scratchy if you don't wear a bra. Too many work-arounds needed to wear this dress for me.","1-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/norra-maxi-dress?color=011","Missakov","Floaty Summer perfection","This dress is just gorgeous. The straps are adjustable so you can wear it where you like. The material is a floaty sort of cottony material, it’s very soft. There is an embroidery in the material which is slightly scratchy so I had to wear a bra with it. It looked lovely on though so totally worth it.","30-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/blu-abito-shift-dress?color=009","ivydiVINE","Magical Huge Dress","Super fun artistic dress- feel really creative in it! It does run huge - it's like comically large but I found that to be the fun of it - it felt like dress-up and made me really happy. The only drawback is the fabric is itchy so have to wear something under it.","20-May-2020"

It does run large and I could have gone down a size but wanted to keep the look of the model. If you look closely she is wearing it oversized.","21-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wild-zip-front-romper?color=020","gionna0nakieta","Easy to wear, fit as expected","Wore this with tennies and sandals. I have a really long torso, and it still fit well! Loved that it disguised my mini baby bump (wore during 12-14 weeks) and would definitely fit for a lot longer with a growing baby body! I was nervous to order because of negative reviews, but loved and am considering purchasing!","20-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flora-puff-sleeve-v-neck-blouse?color=079","JAG","Wanted To Love","I really wanted to love this. I knew it would be oversized and cropped but did not realize how open and deep the neckline would be. Because of this, it looks like I am wearing the wrong size top versus a purposeful oversized boxy/ flowy fit. I recommend wearing this with something high waisted. It may look good with a lace bralet underneath. Just know that when you sit down the V on the neckline May dip below your bra band.","11-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flora-puff-sleeve-v-neck-blouse?color=079","signedsara","Spring to Fall Worthy","I love this top! It is light, flowy, and comfortable. The color is perfect for spring and will work all the way through fall. The v-neck is a little low for my taste but it is an easy fix - I put a pink tank under. I wore it with boyfriend jeans and camel color sandals. I got a couple of compliments and maybe some new Nuuly subscribers. I think I will buy this one!","7-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/venezia-textured-lace-top?color=031","RJ","I wore it backwards","This top was kind of boxy as the other reviews mentioned. I liked it as a casual throw & go. I have long hair, but for me the breeziness of the v-cut back was awkward and annoying. I ended up wearing it backward. Cute, but not super exciting. I think I could have sized down to reduce the boxiness, too.","8-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/venezia-textured-lace-top?color=031","foodiemama","Just Okay","I really love the idea of this top, but I didn't love it on-- it was just ""okay"". Kind of short and boxy, but awkward to front tuck because it doesn't drape well.","4-May-2020"

It's thick enough that it doesn't flip or turn. It's light enough for summer. I wore it with a blue tank top and sandals. If I hadn't already bought a different item in my nuuly shipment this month I would have purchased.","12-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emma-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=071","NewlyNuuly","Great color and well constructed","These pants were very cute. I usually don't wear wide legged pants because I am so short (5'2"") and feel it makes me look even shorter! These didn't do that but the 27P I ordered were way too big. The fabric is super stretchy. I wish I would have gone down at least 1 size.","18-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emma-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=071","mjleveris","Love love love!","Loved these pants way more than I ever expected. I probably wouldn't have ordered them but was excited to rent them and fell in love. Can style with almost anything, much more versatile than imagined. Super comfy. They do wrinkle easily though and will stretch out throughout the day. I was worried the 27 would be too small but fit perfect. I think if I had ordered the 28 they would have stretched out even more and really have bagged. Planning on purchasing, gotten many compliments","16-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emma-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=071","Kar","Stylish & comfortable","Cute pants. I am on the short side with a short torso...these definitely fit me a bit differently than they did on the model. Waist was a tad long and the leg hit just below my ankle. Which is nothing new for me but I will probably size down and rent them again. I paired with a plain white T and cropped black cardi. Got a bunch of compliments!","14-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emma-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=071","drmomma","Retro feel, good for petites","Loved these pants! Fit like a glove with a little stretch. They do wrinkle easily.","2-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emma-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=071","Em","Thin & more green than golden","They were fine. I was excited for them because I love mustard/golden shades and liked the cut of the pants. However the fabric is a thinner material and would be great for summer but not substantial enough for year-round wear. The color is more like pea soup green/yellow. Think ripe avocado. It was terrible with my olive skin tone. Fit as expected. Bagged out slightly after wearing all day.","30-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emma-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=071","Sandra","Fun pants!","Love the super fun color and the fit was almost perfect. Maybe a little long in the rise and I am very long waisted so might not be good if you're not. The fabric is super stretchy and comfy. Definitely a keeper.","18-Apr-2020"

The only reason I didn't buy it was because it doesn't stay in place all the time, I think because of the fabric it's made out of. Highly recommend for a fun top.","12-May-2020"

The strips on top we too loose even tightening them on max to the point of bra area coming down too low, and the hips area looked awkward.

If you have a big tush like I do, or a little bit of tummy, you can go a size higher, but big boobs don't work with this one because in that area, the cut of the dress is very tight.

The only issue was that it ran really big. Using the adjustable straps helped but I had to belt it because there was so much extra fabric. Fortunately it still looks good styled with a belt!

The strips on top we too loose even tightening them on max to the point of bra area coming down too low, and the hips area looked awkward.

If you have a big tush like I do, or a little bit of tummy, you can go a size higher, but big boobs don't work with this one because in that area, the cut of the dress is very tight.

The strips on top we too loose even tightening them on max to the point of bra area coming down too low, and the hips area looked awkward.

If you have a big tush like I do, or a little bit of tummy, you can go a size higher, but big boobs don't work with this one because in that area, the cut of the dress is very tight.

The strips on top we too loose even tightening them on max to the point of bra area coming down too low, and the hips area looked awkward.

If you have a big tush like I do, or a little bit of tummy, you can go a size higher, but big boobs don't work with this one because in that area, the cut of the dress is very tight.

The strips on top we too loose even tightening them on max to the point of bra area coming down too low, and the hips area looked awkward.

If you have a big tush like I do, or a little bit of tummy, you can go a size higher, but big boobs don't work with this one because in that area, the cut of the dress is very tight.

I wore it both dressed up with heeled boots and dressed down with an oversized sweater on top and got lots of compliments. I might have kept it if I liked the color more.

Perfect option for hourglass or pear figures.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bias-slip-dress2?color=052","EricaF","So Pretty, a little roomy.","I love the way the dress looked on but it did fit a little loose. Typically, I expect the bias cut style to run closer to the body but I should have stuck with an XS instead of S. There was room in the hips. I still wore it by belting the middle and throwing a cropped sweater on top.","29-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bias-slip-dress2?color=052","clk1217","Gorgeous fabric, love the adjustable straps","Really gorgeous dress! I wore this to a friend's wedding and got many compliments. The only issue was that it ran really big. Using the adjustable straps helped but I had to belt it because there was so much extra fabric. Fortunately it still looks good styled with a belt! I'm usually a size 10/12 & the L was much too big so I recommend sizing down. Other than that, the color was such a pretty blush. Would def wear again!","19-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bias-slip-dress2?color=052","kseniacold","Runs big in hips","This dress runs big, so I missed the size. I am normally between S and M, and this should be S. The strips on top we too loose even tightening them on max to the point of bra area coming down too low, and the hips area looked awkward. Even with a belt the hip area was too big, baggy, so I was hard to dressed it up.","14-Nov-2019"

I am not an overalls person at all-- I don't think they're usually very flattering on my body type, especially when they're too fitted/skinny as most are anymore. But these! These fit more like a true workwear piece, the kind of thing you would genuinely wear in a workshop or art studio (and I did!). Lots of pockets, easy through the legs, and a true thick denim. The only thing to note is that I am a size 4 and chose an XS. They're a teeny bit tighter at the waist than I would want when I first put them on, but they ease out a little bit and I think a size up would be way too big all over.

I am not an overalls person at all-- I don't think they're usually very flattering on my body type, especially when they're too fitted/skinny as most are anymore. But these! These fit more like a true workwear piece, the kind of thing you would genuinely wear in a workshop or art studio (and I did!). Lots of pockets, easy through the legs, and a true thick denim. The only thing to note is that I am a size 4 and chose an XS. They're a teeny bit tighter at the waist than I would want when I first put them on, but they ease out a little bit and I think a size up would be way too big all over.

Unfortunately they were COMICALLY huge on me, and I never ending up wearing them. Definitely go for the smaller of two sizes you're considering. Other than the sizing, I thought the open back detail & criss-crossing straps of the overalls was cute, and the dark denim was soft and would have gone with a lot of different shirts/sweaters underneath!

I am not an overalls person at all-- I don't think they're usually very flattering on my body type, especially when they're too fitted/skinny as most are anymore. But these! These fit more like a true workwear piece, the kind of thing you would genuinely wear in a workshop or art studio (and I did!). Lots of pockets, easy through the legs, and a true thick denim. The only thing to note is that I am a size 4 and chose an XS. They're a teeny bit tighter at the waist than I would want when I first put them on, but they ease out a little bit and I think a size up would be way too big all over. I'll probably end up buying these now or later, they're just so classic, practical, and cool.","24-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shira-tiered-tunic?color=001","hhoffmann","Really wanted to like, but...","Such a breezy, cute dress that could be worn casually or a bit more dressed up. However, it made me look like a house. Really unflattering on my short frame because of the lack of shape, and I usually like a flowy silhouette. Didn't wear.","13-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/heritage-bubblegum-straight-leg-jeans?color=066","AthenSpec","Perfect fit for a petite, curvy figure","I purchased these because they fit me so well and who doesn't love pink jeans? I am short and curvy, and always surprised when pants hug my figure, without being too tight. The length was excellent, coming down to my ankles. Maybe not a style for taller gals, but *perfect* for me. I would have never chosen this brand if not for Nuuly.","21-Apr-2020"
