It is soft, warm but not too hot on mild nights. My husband liked it too, commenting that it was ""great"". The neck is wider than it looks online which only helps with comfort and keeps any wind factor at bay. It goes with almost everything. You could even throw this over a maxi skirt and look stylish. I wore it with wide-leg denim, straight denim, and leggings. All looked cute.","30-Apr-2020"

It’s so soft and feels really well made. It’s purposely designed to be slightly oversized in a cute way. I usually order smalls or mediums in sweaters and a small was perfect. Also I guess I could tell the future because I did end up buying it. Shrug emoji!","27-Feb-2020"

The neck is kind of stiff and i felt like it laid weird, more like didn't lay at all. It stood straight up and gaped a lot around my neck.

The color is perfect, although if you know orange is not your color, maybe avoid! It's a deeper orange, but orange nonetheless. It's perfect for fall and winter. A thicker sweater and very warm, but still able to layer is under smaller bomber type jackets. Not itchy at all. Perfect fit.","10-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-detail-sweater?color=053","trangxnguyen11","Gorgeous Color, Best for Lounging","The sweater color was just as pictured! Not a color I would normally purchase, so great for a rental. I ordered the XS and it fit as a slightly baggy sweater, so I felt it was more appropriate for lounging/casual wear than to dress it up quite like the model (but I'm also very petite). I wore this home for the holidays and my mom ended up borrowing it and wearing it EVERYWHERE - she didn't mind the oversized fit as she likes to layer sweaters with long sleeves underneath.","9-Jan-2020"

Keep in mind that I may be a little biased here as I'm obsessed with white sweaters. The neck detail is really cute and unexpected in person, and there's a lot of nice little detail throughout the body of the sweater too. Definitely something i would rent again.","12-Jan-2020"

The neck detail is subtle but really unique, and I got a lot of compliments on the sweater. It also still felt modest enough to wear to work!

The details of the sweater make it stand out from other ""winter white"" pieces I've been seeing everywhere. The pattern on the sweater is really interesting, and of course, the neckline is cool. It is a little annoying to get on the sweater without getting makeup all over it, but I guess that's part of a white turtleneck garment. The fit is def a little oversized and boxy,","30-Dec-2019"

I'm usually a small but sized down to an XS which worked out for me sizewise. The neck area isn't tight by any means but the collar is too tall, I think?

It is a super comfortable fabric and the length is very work appropriate, but also stylish for an outing. It is a wrap dress, so the fit is always going to be hard, but all things considered it fit me very well.

The lapel/collar thing doesn't really stay folded and I had to pin it for a work event so it didn't fall open. The weirdest thing is that the hole where the tie loops through on the wrap skirt is really big- so big that even if you position it perfectly, you end up seeing through the hole when you moved. I solved it by wearing a black tank top under and it was barely perceptible, but you'd think they would know how to make a wrap dress so that you don't see your skin through the hole!","9-Feb-2020"

It’s exquisitely soft and warm, and felt so wonderful on that I had a hard time taking it off. Friends will pet this coat. I wasn’t sure if the print or length would work with anything I own (plus, faux fur often ends up looking more “stuffed animal” than stylish or chic), but the muted colors are surprisingly versatile.

The buckle in the back is such a cute detail, and I loved playing with different proportions with these pants.

They have a very relaxed fit from thigh down, but run a bit small around the booty and waist, which is perfect for me because I have a tiny midsection and a lot of hip. I checked out the other reviews and followed the advice to size up - super glad I did. One size up worked for me, but depending on your waist, perhaps consider going two up. If you're looking for a comfy fit with a super high rise - this is it! Perfect for crop tops and shirts you want to tuck in.","17-Jan-2020"

The buckle in the back is such a cute detail, and I loved playing with different proportions with these pants.

They have a very relaxed fit from thigh down, but run a bit small around the booty and waist, which is perfect for me because I have a tiny midsection and a lot of hip. I checked out the other reviews and followed the advice to size up - super glad I did. One size up worked for me, but depending on your waist, perhaps consider going two up. If you're looking for a comfy fit with a super high rise - this is it! Perfect for crop tops and shirts you want to tuck in.","17-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jersey-leopard-cardi?color=066","SchnipSchnap","Great layering cardi","This was the perfect cardi to just throw on and dress up a basic tee, which is how I typically wore it. It was light weight. Based on previous reviews, I sized down to M (I am typically between M and L) and it was the perfect fit. There was still plenty of room since it's an open cardi with no closure. This was fun to add to my wardrobe for the month since I usually shy away from animal prints. But loved this one because of the color too!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The fit is a little boxy, so it looked best with a French Tuck (thanks Tan France!) into a highwaisted something (jeans or shirt both worked well.) I also wore this with a chambray button down under and black leggings on a flight and was super comfy, yet felt stylish. Would rent again","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shina-tiered-jacquard-midi-dress?color=041","kamapa","Hip Banding Ruins It","The fabric is nice and thick and it has sleeves and a good length so it would have been a perfect winter dress if not for 2 things. There is a snug band at the hips which gives it a very unflattering shape - it makes the skirt poof out at the stomach and side handles areas which I can't imagine would be flattering on anyone. Also the top was a bit large for me - the shoulders were a bit broad so I couldn't get the collar to sit nicely/flatly unless I pulled on it. There is some room in the bust which I didnt need but I'm sure some women would really appreciate. All in all, I wore it one time because it's so pretty but was self conscious the whole time about the stomach/hip area. Would not wear again.","25-Dec-2019"

It was a tad big on me, so I think I should have tried the medium instead. It's a cute dress, but the puffy skirt felt a bit too county for my tastes. The medium might have looked more like the model photo... Otherwise, it's a quality piece in a heavy courderoy material. It has pockets and a detachable belt. The trim is really beautiful.

The colorways and design of this should give you the confidence to strut. The only downfall is that this piece is for looks and wouldn't keep you warm during the winters.

It works if you arrive and your girls are wearing t -shirts, and it works if their decked out. Plus the fabric didn't irritate my neck or wrists which is HARD to find for me. The colors are nice and muted in person. Overall love.","30-Jan-2020"

I recommend renting it for fun events temporarily and would stay away from placing it among your other clothes, especially black ones, because the jacket leaves the green fluff on everything. Also - eating is tricky in this jacket as well. The fluff ends up in your mouth, eyeballs and everything else. It's like having a hairy cat!","9-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/houndstooth-sparkle-sweater?color=031","casperandyy","Consider the environment","This sweater was very cute, soft, and warm. There is some mild shedding from the silver pieces which didn't bother me initially from a cleanliness perspective. But upon further thought, this sweater may have some negative environmental impact. This sweater is made primarily from synthetic materials and each wash between rental is probably introducing microplastics to the waterways. Just something to consider if this is something important to you.","2-Mar-2020"

Can't go wrong with skinny jeans and hiking boots, though I wish I had red plaid pants like the photo. The tinsel-looking yarn is itchy, but the green yarn is very soft, so it was kind of a wash.

The only thing is that either it runs large or has been stretched out. I'm 5'4"" and, like the pick shows, the sleeves come down low on your hands but when they do, you don't really get that pretty poof that the pic shows. It's more of a volume look bc the yarn is heavy. Also, I have broad shoulders and usually have fit issues there with Smalls but there was plenty of room in the sweater. If I order again, and I might, I will consider sizing down to an XS.","11-Dec-2019"

You may not notice in the photos, but there are interesting flaps of fabric stitched around the entirety of the skirt. This detailing makes it fit weird and no matter which way you where it, it always feels like its on backwards? I’m passing on this skirt.","24-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/embellished-mesh-top?color=001","KCS","Very Pretty, But Totally Sheer","This was a very pretty top, but disappointing in a few areas. For one thing, it's completely sheer; the model's wearing a camisole underneath. And as someone who only owns lingerie camisoles, I was not happy to learn I'd have to go purchase a supportive dressy camisole to wear with this as it's so sheer you can see straight through it. For another, it has a large textile breakdown tag at the side like all garments do, which is distractingly visible. As it's a rental, you can't cut this out to make the garment wearable. If it had fit perfectly I might have gone ahead and worn it, as the beading is beautiful and the look itself is gorgeous. However, the sleeves were extremely itchy around the ruffled detailing and I couldn't get past the large visible tag. Probably would look best tucked in to hide the textile tag, but that defeats the purpose of its long hemline. Just not for me, this one.","2-Jan-2020"

This shirt does come in petite sizes on various websites, but I'm 5'2"" and found the small to fit perfectly: still a nice drop shoulder and room to keep it from being tight, but not too long or baggy to make it look ill-fitting.","20-Feb-2020"

Usually between S-M tops with wide shoulders and a small bust/waist but in this I was swimming in the shoulders and it was so tight and short in the bust/torso, that it was nearly a swim top style.

The back is smocked and stretchy so it's easy to get on and off and fits snug to your body. It's cropped on me but I'm very tall so may be full length on more petite women.

I wear a 36A and have narrow shoulders, so a lot of times blouses like this droop and won't stay up. This one, though, fits really nicely in the bust and has elastic on the shoulders so it stays put. I got the large even though I usually wear a small or medium in tops and it fits perfectly. I wouldn't recommend it if you have about a C cup - there's elastic along the back, but the actual cup size is small.

I am pear-shaped and almost always wear a size medium, but this shirt runs very small. It also could maybe use a side zipper to make getting in and out a bit easier. In defense of this shirt, that IS the way it's styled - to be a very close fit - so just be careful that you have the right body type for this shirt and will need to perfectly fit both your bust and your ribcage.","9-Dec-2019"

One is that the yellow is not as bright as in the photos, so take that with a grain of salt. It's more mustard-y.

If you are, it might not be for you. I did feel that the bottom white stripe fell at a bad place for me where I carry some around the middle. Still cute overall.","21-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rebekah-sweater-tunic?color=018","Soextra","Modern, warm AF, so cozy.","Really liked this sweater. The color block on the sleeves is a great touch, it's soft and fluffy but still makes you look put together due to the design. I would've bought it if I hadn't spent so much money this month already.","19-Dec-2019"

I loved that the fit was perfect for my large chest and left a bit of room for my belly. Looked great with blue jeggings and ankle boots.","17-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rebekah-sweater-tunic?color=018","Elly","LOVED!!!","I lived in this sweater-it was a super stylish basic and I received compliments on it. It is meant to fit like a tunic, so it is long and not totally fitted-but I didn't find it to be sloppy at all. I had a hard time sending it back!","12-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rebekah-sweater-tunic?color=018","KelleyAnn11","Strangely tight binding along the bottom","This was pretty cute from the hip up but the bottom edge gas a binding that is too tight. It prevents the sweater from hanging straight down and causes a weird bubble along the bottom edge. It's quite unflattering.","9-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rebekah-sweater-tunic?color=018","LaRae","Cute and comfy but very long","I wanted to love this sweater but it was way too long on me. I suppose ""tunic"" should've tipped me off but I prefer my ""long"" sweaters to be a bit shorter. I'm 5'3 so petite, and ordered and XS.","6-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rebekah-sweater-tunic?color=018","KTB33","Size Down","I didn't believe the previous posters that said to size down because I hate to get something in that is too small, but this sweater is really big and I should have sized down. Otherwise this is super cute, and I still made it work.","6-Dec-2019"

I wore it several times on dreary fall days. Not as soft as I would have liked, but a nice thick knit and not too itchy.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rebekah-sweater-tunic?color=018","AmberPDX","Super Cute Basic","I love the cute yellow detail on the arms of this sweater. It's a great everyday basic. It's a tad wide in the waist and the hem tucks in a bit, creating a very slight bubble effect, so isn't the most flattering - but this didn't keep me from wearing it!","25-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rebekah-sweater-tunic?color=018","AlexandraMD","Super cute, but SUPER itchy","I have really sensitive skin, so I was careful not to pick sweaters that have wool in them. I find it hard to believe this sweater doesn't have wool, it's so itchy! The sweater is really cute and warm, I wore it with skinny jeans and black pants to work and it's a bit long on me, but I'm also only 5'2''.","25-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rebekah-sweater-tunic?color=018","eknorman","Such a cute basic sweater!","I love this sweater. I did read that some people thought it was boxy. I didn't find that to be the case. You can do so much with this. A simple jeans look, with a skirt, or added with layers. It is very soft. Not at all itchy. I would highly recommend.","21-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rebekah-sweater-tunic?color=018","CA2","Simple and cute!","I’m usually go back and forth between a M and L in sweaters and the M fit. I could have gone up to a L so it wasn’t as tight across my hips/backside but I have an hourglass shape so that’s pretty typical with this tunic style. I love the hit of mustard yellow on the sleeve! It’s a color that I am drawn to but rarely wear!","13-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rebekah-sweater-tunic?color=018","censtrom","Cute but boxy","Super cute sweater, very soft, perfect length for tights because of the length. It is very boxy, basically like a shift dress, so just know it removes any waist you might have.","7-Nov-2019"
