"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vintage-30s-cocktail-dress?color=001","Itinerantd","Cool piece of history; more like XS size","So at first I thought the material feels like a heavy polyester and wondered if they had that back in the 30s, but then I noticed the metallic snap buttons at the neck and cuffs were really old, so my doubts dissipated. There is also no garment tags. The top is sheer lace and shoulders are slightly puff sleeved. Unfortunately the neckline was really tight and cut into my throat. Otherwise the fit was tight on the torso but still wearable. It'd say it's actually XS sizing because I usually wear XS tops and this was tight on top. Length was not too short.","8-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","JennB","So cute but not the easiest","I loved this sweater it is so cute. Couple of things. Mine definitely wasn’t as long as it looked on the model. And it was a tad itchy on the inside from the lurex so if you’re sensitive to that stuff maybe skip this style.","27-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","Charis","Pretty and warm","So soft and cozy. Gold threads running through gave it a luxe touch. Slouchy and oversized but cute with leggings or black jeans.","11-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","jasmito","Beautiful sweater","I loved this sweater and wore it a few times during the month. The thread and texture details are so lovely. I wore it out to dinner with a friend and it looks so nice. Highly recommend.","9-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","cali_girl","Disappointed","This was not cute on me at all. It was baggy but in a weird way that seemed not intentional. Maybe it was just really stretched out by a previous rental? It was longer in the torso than expected and sort of bulged at that stomach. Not flattering. I also was not impressed by the pattern in person. It had more going on than I thought from the photos.","4-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","hintka","Super cozy, perfect for dreary winter days!","I loved this sweater. It's very soft and cozy; I wore it over and over because it was just so comfortable. There is a little bit of metallic shine in some of the material which gives it a little spark. Almost purchased.","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","AlexandriaT","So fun!","I loved this sweater! It fit well and I loved the colors and but of sparkle from the gold yarn. Got tons of compliments each time I wore it. It feels a little itchy when you pull it out of the tote but I didn’t notice any itching on.","24-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","sarahday","I felt like a polar bear (but a cute polar bear)","I think I played myself here by ordering a large when I should have gotten the medium...this was a very roomy sweater, and because it's pretty fuzzy I felt kind of lost in it. it was a bit more sparkly than I imagined, and overall was a little too feminine for me. that said, it is SUPER WARM...really good for a cold snap...and it's soft (not itchy or irritating in the slightest). I have worn this once since it arrived and probably won't again, but again, that's probably more my fault than the sweater's.","22-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","HEKoko","Perfect slightly oversized sweater","I wore this ALL the time. It was not itchy at all, though I generally do wear a tank underneath. It does have some sparkley thread that you can’t really see in the photo, but it’s subtle. I will say that I felt like when I first opened my nuuly, this sweater kind of smelled...not necessarily bad smelling but it smelled like it had been cleaned with something with a fragrance. I’m sensitive to synthetic smell so I literally hung it up next to the open window for a day and then it was fine. Overall HIGHLY recommend!","21-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","mynameisjane","Cozy and so cute","As other reviewers mentioned, this runs small so I was happy I sized up. I love this sweater! It's SO cozy and soft. Pairs well with jeans or black joggers. I wore it at least twice. Highly recommend.","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","jt97","Cute pattern but slightly itchy and frumpy","I loved the light colors in this sweater, which I paired with dark blue jeans and UGG boots. It was slightly itchy, but I layered a long sleeve tee underneath for both warmth and prevent discomfort. It fit pretty loosely and didn't accentuate my shape so it wasn't the most flattering on my petite body but I still loved the colors!","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","Ajs92","SO soft and it's sparkly","I couldn't tell in the photos that this had sparkly yarn through it. It was still cute, just not the look I was expecting. Ended up wearing this more than I thought I would because of how soft it was. Ran a little big.","19-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","Shmecky","Want this to fit better","It's warm and cute, but... It is really wide in the body and short in length. The arm hole is on my underarm, making the garment raise with my arms. The neck is a smidge too tight! Bummer on the fit, it's a cute b sweater!","4-Feb-2020"

It's different than anything in my closet right now and could be worn pretty much anywhere. I wore it to work, out, hanging on the weekends. Went well with jeans or work pants.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","VictoriaTeal","Soft & sparkly","I loved this sweater because of the pattern woven into it. It’s just a tad small so if you like your sweaters a little looser size up.","16-Jan-2020"

I live in the south so it wasn't worth buying it, but I would def rent it again next year.","14-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","Carolynnkayy","Fun and festive","I read a review that said this was super itchy but it wasn’t as bad as I thought. I wore it on Christmas Eve and New Years over two different slip dresses (one mauve and one silver sequined). Got several compliments and it kept me warm. Not sure if the description mentions this but there is a little bit of silver tinsely yarn woven into it.","4-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","katiejbur","Stunning in person","The pattern of this sweater is absolutely stunning in person. I loved it. It was a little itchy and shed white fuzz, but nothing a tank top can't help. Love!","2-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","Jlheyy","Gorgeous winter sweater","I love everything about this sweater. It is an intended oversized fit, but I still recommend sizing down so it doesn’t look like it’s swallowing you. Only the slightest hint of itch, but I’m super sensitive and still loved wearing it :)","31-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","Maevebee","I should have known “eyelash”=itchy","This sweater was really cute on, just the right kind of “oversized”. How ever, the material was pretty scratchy. I’m not a sensitive person but I found I really had to concentrate on not paying attention to how uncomfortable this sweater felt on.","24-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fay-eyelash-sweater?color=090","moelee10","Soft and cozy, but oversized","Really love this sweater. It's soft, cosy and the print is beautiful. Feels high-end. The only caveat is that it runs very large, more than a ""baggy"" fit. I am normally a size S on top and I'm swimming in it. I think an XS may even be too big. Hate to have it sit in the bag for the month so will need to get creative with ways to wear it, so keep in mind when you are picking your size!","20-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dulce-pommed-knit-poncho?color=011","Vermonty","Lots to like, but beware","I really wanted to like this top! It has cool, gold thread throughout and adorable tassels along the hem. However. The fit is somewhat strange because of the tight sleeves that pull the poncho tight when you move around. (Yes, you need to wear a layer underneath). Also, the weave is so loose, it would probably snag if you looked at it funny. Oh, and one more thing, it's rather more bulky than it appears in the photos. Dealbreakers for me, but maybe not for you?","9-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dulce-pommed-knit-poncho?color=011","mk6","Got so many compliments","Everyone loved this and asked where I got it. It's bold and fun especially with the pom poms at the bottom.","24-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dulce-pommed-knit-poncho?color=011","vscrimer","Very bulky","I thought this sweater was a bit too bulky and heavy even for an oversized poncho. It was excessively hot and the sleeves were very thick and long.","14-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dulce-pommed-knit-poncho?color=011","Znjc7","Loved it","I was pretty apprehensive to rent this based on the other reviews, but I’m so glad I did! Really cute. Have to wear something under if going to be in professional environment. It is very warm, but I didn’t find it very itchy - and I’m very sensitive to wool! I got lots of compliments!","6-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dulce-pommed-knit-poncho?color=011","lesmarieday","Really Warm","A very warm poncho, and I got several compliments while wearing it. My arm movement was a bit restricted while wearing it, so I don't think it's the right piece for me. Super cute though!","4-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dulce-pommed-knit-poncho?color=011","BelleMama","Cute cozy poncho","This poncho is very cozy and soft. I would style with boot cut denim and boots. I am 5'4 and it did look very big on me so I think a boot with a heel would work well","4-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dulce-pommed-knit-poncho?color=011","Maggie_B","Fun and very warm","I rented this in December and wore it for a few casual dinners/drinks with friends. It's a fun piece and I got a bunch of compliments on it. The only problem with ponchos, which I didn't realize because this was my first poncho ever - is that they don't really work under coats! This one got all bunched up around the armpits and I felt like a stuffed animal in my winder coat. I'd suggest this for the early fall or spring, when you can wear it as your only additional layer.","15-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dulce-pommed-knit-poncho?color=011","Whit8702","Cute but itchy and heavy","This was cute, but unfortunately too thick for the warm Texas winter and very itchy.","14-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dulce-pommed-knit-poncho?color=011","bigblueknome","decided I don't really like ponchos","Ponchos are comfy like a blanket, but you can't wear a coat over them, and the sleeves always get in your way. I liked this one enough. It was cute and soft. But at the end of the day, it's still a poncho, and it reminded me that I don't like ponchos. True to size and color.","4-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dulce-pommed-knit-poncho?color=011","LM27","Wish this worked","I love the idea of this poncho and thought it would be a great alternative to constantly wearing sweaters in the winter. I was super surprised however by how heavy it was, so heavy in fact it was almost impossible for me to wear a jacket over it, and it was way too warm for typical indoor wear. It also was definitely a little itchy. Overall fit is what I expected, look is cute, but I just couldn't find an occasion that made sense for it (too warm for indoors and too warm with a coat over it, too cold for wear by itself outside).","2-Jan-2020"

The color and quality were very nice, but it was unexpectedly a shin length crop on me at 5'6, and the proportions were really not flattering on my long waisted body.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/evil-eye-coyote-jumpsuit?color=065","lavitacarlita","adorable candy colored uniform","fits a little small, so size up, but overall it's a super cute cotton candy dream of a jumpsuit. fit through hips and waist is a little awkward proportionally since there aren't any pockets or details to break up the look, but it's nothing a cute belt or some body confidence can't fix/overcome. I ended up throwing a vintage belt and a slightly oversized longline sweater over it to disguise the awkward cut & felt great & got tons of compliments. peeing is a workout since it buttons instead of zipping up the front, but that's kind of just the standard price a girl pays to rock a badass jumpsuit. worth it!","3-Mar-2020"

I'm normally a size 10 and I rented the XL. It was way too small in the waist, too large in the bust and just right in the arms. I measured it and the bust is 18.5"" across but the waist is only 14"" across (and with little stretch). Too bad the fit is so crazy because it's a pretty knit pattern. My recommendation is to give this one a pass.","2-Apr-2020"

I loved the neckline, it made me feel like royalty! The knit fabric was gorgeous even though animal print is not my thing. I didn't get to wear it out cause it was a bit too warm for where I was. I think pairing it with tights is the way to go. My waist is smaller than my hips and shoulders, so the fit worked for me. If your waist is more in line with your hips or if you are abundant in the bust, you may want to size up. Totally worth it, though.","18-Mar-2020"

The rose-and-animal-print pattern is interesting and feels modern and romantic at the same time. My only complaint is that the high waistline was very tight with zero stretch.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emi-midi-dress?color=009","Coral","Classy winter dress!","I was a bit intimidated to rent it because of the reviews concerning the fit but I took the advice and ordered a size up - a regular small instead of an XS. Very happy I did this! I have a wide ribcage for my size overall so it was a risky choice, but I didn't want to go all the way up to a medium and have it end up being baggy. The regular small just fit. It was definitely tight around the ribcage but luckily not too tight - just very snug and fitted. I felt I had the option to not wear a bra though and have a little more room. There is enough structure and the fabric is thick enough to do this if you can typically get away without wearing bras. I would be careful if you are busty however. In general, definitely size up at least one size. It was indeed a bit hard to get in and out of but once it was on it was comfortable and I loved it. Very beautiful classy piece that was perfect for a day in the office then on to dinner followed by a holiday party - it worked in all of these situations throughout the day and garnered compliments!","6-Dec-2019"

I don't have much up there so had to use a lot of fashion tape to keep it together... A bit of a hassle but do-able for a night. I was impressed by the length. As a 5'2'' girl, long dresses usually have to be hemmed for me. This was the perfect length!","12-Dec-2019"

I am 5'1"" so knew the length might be a challenge (which it was) but the chest was a bizarre fit. The waist zipped up but the chest/bra part of this dress jutted out forward exposing my breasts. The hips add so much bulk that it makes you look way bigger than you actually are. Maybe on a different body type, but not mine.","29-Nov-2019"

I still wore it, but due to the slight bagginess I had to wear a tank top underneath because the dress is made from a stiff material that shifts a bit throughout the night, so the slightly large neckline kept opening up more and more.

I did not like how it fit me on the top. The seams hit me in all the wrong places. I tend to be bigger busted and I looked huge in this dress.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/heartbeats-mini-dress?color=060","Chandler","Ended up loving","So when I first put this on I was like, “Oh no!” because the fitted section of fabric at the waist was directly hugging the biggest part of my tummy. I feel like it would’ve been a better dress if that band of fabric were either shorter or placed higher up. However, after some examining in the mirror I decided it was still overall flattering and the great parts of this dress outweighed the slightly imperfect waist issue. The fabric is so soft and comfy, the sleeves are beautiful, and it’s so versatile. I ended up wearing it a TON and loving it.","12-Jan-2020"

It is true to size and not oversized! Only thing is that the defined waist part didn’t really work on me (it was too low, where my love handles start to creep in) which is the only reason I didn’t buy it. Other than that, it’s soft and comfortable and a beautiful print.","10-Dec-2019"

It’s a gorgeous emerald green Color and impeccably made. I‘m usually an XS or small in tops, and based on the reviews, I went with the XS (note - I’m a 34D/DD). It fit perfectly. With shirts like this, I sometimes worry about “side boob”, even though I work hard to keep my arms in shape. This just wasn’t an issue with this top. It’s cut just right at the arms without cutting in to the armpit area. If you have the occasion to wear this, it would pair nicely with black slacks like the model has on, or a cute skirt or shorts. I’ll probably be ordering this one again!","12-Feb-2020"

Cool.” I didn’t get to wear the sweater as much I’d like because it’s very hot. And the neck of the sweater is tight with a thick knit - making it guaranteed to mess up hair and makeup.

It’s closer to T-shirt material than a sweater. If you’re looking for something nice, this looks too casual in person.","12-Jan-2020"

People kind of freaked out about it which was surprising because it seems so casual and simple, but something about it is markedly chic.

Tight neck hole.","I really wanted to love it, but my neck was itchy/irritated because of how tight the mockneck is! I still wore it at least twice because the colors were so interesting and the rest of the fit was great. Works casually or dressed up. The grey looking parts of the print actually carry more of a blue hue... this was a cool top. Perfect length, too. But, seriously though, I will probably not get it again because of the fit of the neck, and I suspect other ladies are unable to even wear this because of that issue.","13-Dec-2019"

I have never had this issue with an item of clothing before. The body part was huge, and my head did not fit through the neck hole. Also, the material is quite cheap. It’s closer to T-shirt material than a sweater. If you’re looking for something nice, this looks too casual in person.","12-Jan-2020"

People kind of freaked out about it which was surprising because it seems so casual and simple, but something about it is markedly chic.

Tight neck hole.","I really wanted to love it, but my neck was itchy/irritated because of how tight the mockneck is! I still wore it at least twice because the colors were so interesting and the rest of the fit was great. Works casually or dressed up. The grey looking parts of the print actually carry more of a blue hue... this was a cool top. Perfect length, too. But, seriously though, I will probably not get it again because of the fit of the neck, and I suspect other ladies are unable to even wear this because of that issue.","13-Dec-2019"

I have never had this issue with an item of clothing before. The body part was huge, and my head did not fit through the neck hole. Also, the material is quite cheap.

I still wore it at least twice because the colors were so interesting and the rest of the fit was great. Works casually or dressed up. The grey looking parts of the print actually carry more of a blue hue... this was a cool top. Perfect length, too. But, seriously though, I will probably not get it again because of the fit of the neck, and I suspect other ladies are unable to even wear this because of that issue.","13-Dec-2019"

It's bulky and somewhat shapeless. If you want a fleece, look no further. But if you want a moto jacket, this won't really do the trick. Also, the color was a little dingy.

It's kind of loosely structured from a very soft, fluffy sherpa material. But the arms ended up a bit tight, so it was difficult to find shirts to wear underneath that you couldn't see (lines from a short-sleeve, for example). I feel like the waist hit strangely on my hips as well. It was such a shame because it's SO warm and cozy, and I would have worn it often if it was perhaps a little bigger and longer.","16-Jan-2020"

The rushing is very slimming but also creates a snug fit because there's so much fabric bunched together by the zipper. It was hard to get closed all the way. So I ordered a 16P in my Nuuly box and the fit was fantastic. I wore it out to a New Year's dinner & a night of dancing. Classy and fun.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cotter-tweed-coat?color=089","Gretch","Cute but not great quality","This felt kind of cheap compared to another jacket I rented this month. Also, sleeves were short. Cute for wearing a couple times.","28-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cotter-tweed-coat?color=089","emzy","Style Points for this Oversized Coat","This pattern and color-scheme was quite chic. The coat ended up being oversized on me (like on the model) so I would've sized down if I was buying it. Having rented items is a lot of fun since you get to experiment with clothing that's oversized and it just felt very fashionable to do so. I didn't rate it as too large though since the model is wearing it in that oversized style as well.","24-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cotter-tweed-coat?color=089","Soextra","Fashion-y, average quality","The tweed has an unusual pattern that stands out in a nice way, looks fashionable, but the hole in the pocket is still there. Also, it doesn't look cheap from afar but wearing it/up close it kinda does.","20-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cotter-tweed-coat?color=089","Jewlz","Cute, but too big and too thin","I love the pattern and the cut, but unfortunately it was just a bit too big on me. If it was more structured, maybe I could've made it work, but it's definitely a thinner coat so it hung too lose. I think if I had sized down and it wasn't winter in NYC I would've loved it, but it was just too big and the wrong time of year for it.","4-Dec-2019"

Fits in everywhere and easy to dress up or down, the only con was that it doesn't close at all (no buttons or zipper on it at all) so be prepared for having to adjust it up onto your shoulders throughout the day - wasn't overwhelmingly annoying but if you don't like fussing with your clothes once you're out the door in the morning I wouldn't recommend.","21-Feb-2020"

I ordered size small in petite but it still ran a bit longer than expected on me. If your upper arms are thinner or less athletic and size taller, this dress might be perfect for you.

I would recommend sizing up, unfortunately for me this was the biggest size option. The other issue is that both I and my friend who is typically a petite small had issues with the sleeves/shoulder area. We think it may be because it is a petite, but its like there isn't enough room between the top of the dress and the top of the shoulder, so our range of motion was restricted despite the sleeves not being too big. Might try a non-petite size (despite us both being petite women), maybe that will do the trick. But yes size up and definitely plan a back-up look if you're renting for an event in case you don't feel comfortable chancing these buttons in public!","1-Dec-2019"

I love wearing dresses when everyone else is fairly casual, and this did the trick. Love it as a winter dress. The fabric is pretty heavy, so it hangs really nicely and is made very well. I almost bought it from my box.","10-Dec-2019"

I don't think that sizing down would solve most of the problems - I think it's just a big ol' dress and it will never look like it does in the picture. Maybe if you're quite tall? And you have giant shoulders and no bust? Maybe...","18-Jan-2020"

I would have never picked this dress but I can confirm that for someone who is 5’ 4” and wears a size 4 that this dress is extremely unflattering. There is too much material and just sits awkwardly. I honestly don’t know what kind of body type this dress is meant to flattery because it is just a lot of material with no shape.","10-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lillie-puffer-jacket?color=065","sarahday","get ready to be REALLY PUFFY.","pro's: very warm, true to size, super cute print and color that went well with pretty much everything. con's: poor pocket placement (you can't really tuck your hands in the pockets since the openings are vertical, which seems like a minor detail until your hands are freezing and there's nowhere to put them), and EXTREMELY PUFFY. it seemed like some of the puffy filling has bunched up in certain areas, so there are some little bulges that aren't the most flattering. I wound up wearing this a lot because it's been absolutely *freezing* in memphis, and this jacket really gets the job done...but you really need to be prepared to feel like Violet in willy wonka after she's been turned into a blueberry. that said, if you don't mind the major puff, you'll love this jacket.","22-Feb-2020"

For the most part, was warm enough (usually around 35-45 degrees). I got lots of compliments on the color and fun print, because it's not just your every-day-black-puffer. The fit was pretty boxy, and I wasn't sure that I liked it, but my fiance convinced me that I looked like an adorable pink marshmallow, in a good way. I wore it with jeans, and over a dress once.","10-Jan-2020"

Because this was a wide leg pant, the looseness really takes over the look if it isn't the right size for you.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gallia-watercolor-floral-skirt?color=015","K8theGr8","Cute but awkward","It was a gorgeous garment but the cut and length is odd. I wore it with spanx to have a smooth line, but even so there was bunching around the waist. If you're a girl with wider hips like me, this is not cut for you. It was tight on the hips and loose on the waist. I wore it once with along shirt over it so you couldn't see the awkwardness at the waist. The length was good and I liked the slit in the side which kept it from being too frumpy.","15-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rosie-dress?color=061","lhart","Cute on model, but not on me","Maybe its because I don't have much definition in my waist, but this just felt like I was wearing a big sack. The only thing cinching the dress is the small tie/belt and it did not stay cinched well. I had to keep pulling the blouse part up to drape it over. I just felt very frumpy in this and didn't end up wearing it. Maybe I could have gone down a size, but I don't think that would've helped the overall shape issues.","15-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/molly-pleated-slim-straight-jeans?color=004","Tucked","Unwearable and not like the photo","These jeans were a disaster for me. They fit fine in the waist, but the crotch/abdonmen area had way too much fabric that was ballooning out. I could have fit a motorcycle helmet in that area, there was so much extra material. The pants were also extremely long - not at all cropped like in the photo. Granted, I'm petite, but these went over my feet onto the ground. Super frumpy and awkward overall, very disappointing.","24-Jan-2020"
