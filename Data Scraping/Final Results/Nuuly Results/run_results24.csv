"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","jesshett","Runs small for free people","Much more sparkle than the photo suggests. It’s cute but runs small in general and REALLY small in free people. Not a true XL, I would say more like a medium. Won’t work for plus size and straight size I recommend you size up at least one.","28-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","JY","Odd fit for me","Liked the color with a subtle sparkle to it and it did fit, but couldn’t get over the weird length (hit me right at my belly button) combined with the puffy sleeves. It’s stylish, but I couldn’t pull it off.","20-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","Deblynn18","Cute","Loved this cute little sweater. Wore it on New Years eve to a low key house party but plan on wearing it to work now that I've bought it :)","7-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","Cvaughan88","Too short","The sleeves on this sweater were very large and the sweater was very short. Not a great fit for me!","2-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","Seven","Cropped fit, great for holidays","Subtly shiny and festive, wore it with a high waisted skirt. Lots of compliments. Unique color.","31-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","ca11ie","Not totally like the picture","Similar to what other reviews have said, this sweater is all sparkle. I also felt like the sleeves were puffier in person. The worst part for me, though, was that the sweater was kind of cropped and you needed really high-wasted pants to hide the bottom seam of the sweater (which is pretty thick). The highest jeans I owned didn't even work that well. Love the color, but I didn't love the sweater overall.","29-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","Breanne","Weird fit","The fit on this have the silhouette of a suit of armor, and the metallic threads made it stiff and scratchy.","25-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","ColleenO","Such a cute sweater! This sweater has hints of shimmer in the thread which I wasn't expecting but it was nice around the Holidays. Very comfy!","I wore a very similar outfit to the models - paired the sweater with green military pants. The two toned green was so pretty!","24-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","Kiki22","Not as pictured!!","This sweater looks NOTHING look it does in the pictures. In the pictures, it looks like a beautiful and soft oatmeal color. In actuality, it is bright gold and very stiff. Nowhere in the description does it state that it is a blinding gold color. The puns of ""shine your way..."" is not explicit enough and the pictures are misleading. If you want a bright, metallic sweater, try this one. Otherwise, it's not worth it. I didn't even try it on when I saw the fabric. I'm very disappointed that this item is blatantly pictured in a way that is not accurate.","21-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","Mph","Not as pictured","Much more glittery than it appears in pictures. Weird sleeves.","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","jlee","warning: it's glittery!","you can't tell at all in the pictures but it does have shiny threads that really cheapen the look and i didn't even wear it out because of the fit. the color and the cut were not flattering on me, I usually have luck with the pieces the model pictured wears, but not this time sadly. the sleeves were too bulky, and it either needed to be shorter or longer since it had the wide band around the waist. if you chance it, try sizing down to wear as a crop top.","18-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","Amylovesclothes","Small sparkly sweater","This sweater is all glitter. If that's your thing. All around it is a little juvenile, the pastel color, the glitter, the cut. It is also very very small. I ordered my normal size small. This didn't even fit my 9 year old. Too small and to sparkly.","16-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/starry-night-sweater?color=012","Torirose","I would recommend sizing up 1 size if you want it to fit like it does on the model. I did not find my normal size to be loose fitting","With jeans and faux leather leggings","12-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bias-midi-skirt?color=018","EllieC2","Loved but waist was too tight","The skirt is beautiful but it’s not forgiving in the waist area. I tired it on but it was too tight to tuck in a shirt. I might have gotten the wrong size but I still would have liked a little give since it is a plus size skirt.","13-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bias-midi-skirt?color=018","katiejbur","Beautiful print","Really gorgeous print and nice quality fabric. It clings to body despite there being plenty of fabric to flow, so it's definitely more body-con than it appears.","2-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","ChezSimone","Classic Wrap Skirt With Unique Pattern","Classic wrap skirt with really fun print. It has horses on it, something I overlooked at first glance(!) which made me love it even more. Perfect midi length with a lot of coverage. Good for events like mother's day and social distancing at . Would rent something similar (new colors?) or this same skirt again.","21-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","mizzrat","One of my favorite skirts from Nuuly","Love the style of this- its a slightly abstract pattern of a horse but I am a big horse lover so I definitely enjoyed wearing it. Plus the feel of this skirt is so soft and lovely! Got lots of compliments. I think I will buy this skirt!","6-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","kelliejeanne","Loved it so much I bought it!","I styled it with a black tube top and with a graphic t shirt, both times it looked amazing. This skirt is so versatile and fun, i ended up buying it!","3-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","krenee","Great skirt for warmer months","Wish I got to wear this skirt! Rented for a trip for somewhere warmer, but didn't get to go. This skirt is a wrap skirt, fits and drapes nice, thinner crepe material. Won't keep you warm as a winter skirt, but great transition piece.","26-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","strum","Beautiful","The wrap on this is perfect, no surprise flashes when you sit down, and the print is fun and rich. I feel like the picture makes the color look more red, when in fact its a terracotta brown.","22-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","MelanieH","Cute, but wrinkly","Lots to like about this skirt- the colors work well and the wrap stays put. Unfortunately, the material wrinkles very quickly, both when wearing it and when storing it.","20-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","Foxheart","Fun to dress up or down","This was a fun piece to style-up for the office. Would love to try it with a tee and sneaks in warmer weather. Great movement to the fabric and loved the print.","19-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","sophieh","Easy fit and unique pattern","Love the pattern of this skirt and the flexibility in sizing and waist height with the wrap design! It is definitely on the longer side - I’m 5’8” and it was longer than mid-calf, more ankle length, so keep in mind for shorter ladies.","18-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","Fiscotti","Compliments galore","Everyone loved the flow and pattern. Thin material as expected so I wore at night to make sure it wasn’t sheer or see through.","14-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","HannaBanana","Great pattern!","I loved this skirt and ended up keeping it because the pattern was so cute and not obviously horses. Very versatile and comfy!","13-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","lilkalove","LOVED IT","This skirt is super flattering. It’s hard to find non-floral women’s patterns and I really appreciated this skirt partly for that reason. I found it to run just a little large, but my waist is small for my body so I might have a skewed perspective. I have short legs and this didn’t swallow me up for make my legs looks even shorter.","3-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","emdubb","So funky and fun!","Got a lot of compliments on this one. Funky and fun","3-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","chloe","fun + comfortable","This is a really cool skirt. I styled it with a black fitted top, black tights and boots. It's a true wrap skirt so it can adjust to fit how you like it. It's a good length that's easy to move in. The fabric is very thin so if you live somewhere cold like I do, you will probably want tights or something underneath.","27-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","Flow","Fun, flattering shape","I love this skirt and get so many compliments when I wear it. It fits me a little high waisted and can be easily be dressed up or down. Flattering on pear figure","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","shancreates","cute & different","I loved this skirt. The pattern was so different! I styled it with a tight long black sleeve and then the cable knit cropped sweater and Glamourous faux leather + sherpa jacket.","16-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","loro","Great Fit","I loved this skirt so much that I bought it! I have very wide hips and it minimized them completely. It was a bit bigger on the waist but didn't bunch when I tied it. Recommend to girls who are a bit bigger on the bottom.","6-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/horse-patterned-wrap-skirt?color=020","G","Runs large","I loved this print and couldn't wait to get it in my order. Sadly, it runs HUGE. Even if I tied it tight around my waist, it bunched up in the back in a very unattractive way. Never got to wear it. Not meant for me but I still love everything about NUULY!!!","31-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kate-tartan-skirt?color=020","VicPocketed","Nice but runs a little large","This skirt is very well made & perfect length for work. It does run a bit large so was loose around my waist/ butt but not so much that it wouldn’t stay up. Would have been a little more flattering just a smidge tighter.","16-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kate-tartan-skirt?color=020","Itati","Well fitted and versatile","This skirt is great, well fitted, doesn't bunch, and can be paired a variety of ways. The only negative is that where the zipper is, there is no hook latch for securing closed, which I often prefer for skirts like this.","13-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kate-tartan-skirt?color=020","cmv00","Fun colorway","Skirt fits a little large, I have wide hips and I still didn't totally fill it out. Still enjoyed wearing it to work though!","9-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kate-tartan-skirt?color=020","SummerinSB","This could have been very cute had I gone a size down. It was just a little big so not very flattering.","Wore it to work with brown suede pumps and a fitted navy turtleneck sweater.","15-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kate-tartan-skirt?color=020","saras123","Cute but runs big.","Such a cute skirt! The length was really nice, and I got compliments on it when I did wear it, but it's just too big around the waist to want to wear it again. Definitely not an average size small.","6-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kate-tartan-skirt?color=020","boskatie","Great Work Skirt","It fit very well throughout, although the waist would get tighter towards the end of the day.

It looked great with a lil' french tuck in the front.","14-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/carys-dolman-top?color=007","KCS","Perfect PXL Fit","As someone who's petite on top and plus on bottom, well-fitting shorter tops are a nightmare to find, so I was extremely pleased to discover this one. This is a lovely addition to my wardrobe, especially for the holidays. I have a job that allows a denim-and-tee dress code, so I'm always looking for ease and comfort, and this is dressy enough that I feel dressed up without being uncomfortable or out of place. It has a great silvery shimmer to it but not so much that I wouldn't be able to wear it in the non-holiday months, which I love. The surplice neckline is very flattering, and while it's a bit low for me that's probably because I have very narrow shoulders. A cami underneath gives me more ease that it won't fall open, but it's also not so low I can't wear it as-is in the evenings. The sleeves are the perfect length for someone with shorter arms, something I'm constantly fighting with in blouses and tops. It has just the right amount of stretch but not so much that I'm worried about poor camouflage. All in all, I've worn this more than once, something I don't usually do with rental clothing, so I call that a big win!","20-Dec-2019"

Especially in the rise. I didn’t end up wearing them too often, because I found them hard to pair with boots or booties due to where they hit on my legs. I think I will rent them again when the weather is warmer and I can wear them with high heel sandals as shown in the photo. Overall, a fun pair of jeans","7-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/carrie-tweed-coat?color=009","Missakov","Love it","I really loved this jacket. Yes it was very roomy and slouchy in style and I could have easily gone down a size but even so it was a great coat. It was warm and felt very stylish. I got so many compliments whilst wearing it. It has two nice roomy pockets which meant I could leave my bag at home and just keep the essentials in my pockets. Normally when people say ‘go down a size’ I think that’s probs not for bodies like mine, but yeah it was huge I could have easily. I’m an XL usually but this was really big. The shoulders and arms fit fine though so going down a size there is the potential to not fit there. I would say for those a medium and below absolutely go down a size. It’s a wonderful coat just a super roomy style.","29-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/penny-denim-coat?color=107","Idub","Bulky, boxy and intense","Jeans with removable fur, fuzzy inside, long length, plus pockets! All the things that make for a great equation. Super cool and trendy, right? Didn't work for me though. It's very warm which is great, but because it's a boxy fit (no shape or silhouette to it at) it makes you look thick and adds bulk. It made my shoulders and arms look huge with and without the fur! The fur was ridiculous and a lot more material than i was expecting. It doesn't rest very flat on the coat shoulders which also made me appear wider than i am. I wanted to look and feel like Macklemore but instead looked like i should be an extra on Game of thrones. I tried using the fur alone with other outfits, but it was too big and impractical. I never ended up wearing this coat because it wasn't flattering. This coat will look great on petite, slender and or lean body types.","16-Jan-2020"

The sleeves were too long, the funneled neck was too much fabric for me and the worst part was that it felt like a cropped sweater. You can see from the pics of the model that it is indeed a shorter sweater, but I felt like I was constantly at risk of my stomach showing, which is outside of my comfort zone. I did try a front, French tuck, but the length was so short that it never stayed tucked. It's a nice, war, sweater, but I wish there was less fabric in the neck and more in the length.","26-Dec-2019"

Looks fun with high-waisted jeans tho. I usually wear a S too but opted for a M to make it a bit cozier.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/contrast-floral-midi?color=000","Pear","Lovely, but didn't fit my pear shape very well","This dress is fantastic. I loved the fabric. The colors are even better in real life. I considered buying it and getting it tailored. It didn't fit me well. I'm 5'4"" 32/30/40. I got the 8. It was too big and too revealing in the bust. I had to wear a tank top under it. The rest of it fit me perfectly, so going up or down a size wouldn't have worked. There's no stretch to the fabric, so the fit has to be perfect. It is very transparent in the sunlight, so plan to wear a slip or leggings under it. It really is beautiful. Maybe it'll fit you better :)","6-Apr-2020"

I do have some wide belts like in the photo, but I opted to wear it without one and the waistline still had a bit of shape to it. The sleeves bugged me though (too long, but not cute rolled up) and the dress is thin and lacks body and swish. Overall, I did enjoy wearing it once out to dinner but it was not a big win.","5-Mar-2020"

But the dress was much more flattering than I expected! I'm on the short side so having the slit on the side (which you can adjust with buttons depending on what you're going for; I wore it to a work event so I used all the buttons and it was perfect) made me look taller. The dress was true to size. The material was soft and on the thinner side; very comfortable and nice to the touch. I got tons of compliments on this dress! I would definitely wear again!","10-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mixed-print-midi?color=000","Brook","Cute","I thought I would LOVE this dress, but I just ended up liking it a lot. I think the belt on the model really helps give it more shape. The fabric is a bit thin and gets static and clingy. But it's still pretty cute! Hard to complain about it overall because I still wore it about felt good in it.","3-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mixed-print-midi?color=000","Hales","Pretty, but Flawed Design","I bought this to wear to a baby shower... ended up wearing something else so I had this hanging in my closet, so I decided to give it a go and make it more casual. I layered it under a sweater and wore with combat boots. The print is very pretty, but the material is VERY thin. Because of that, you definitely need a slip underneath. Also, when you sit, the buttons pull apart on the leg area. The cut is pretty straight so if you want to define the waist, you need a belt like the model, but then it pulls and gathers awkwardly. The neckline is just kinda blah, and the sleeves have no shape so the way the top lays is nothing to rave about. I would just go with something else. Not worth trying to make this work.","27-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mixed-print-midi?color=000","ellievates","Too mature","The fit was very nice and it certainly runs true to size. However, I felt a bit old.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mixed-print-midi?color=000","CocoJax","Fun prairie style but not really my thing","Fit great, material slightly stretchy so great look for the bust and the buttons at the thigh can be unbuttoned as high as you like. It's not really my style but I liked trying the prairie thing, and it was fitted and no fussy ruffly details so that was great. I wore it with black leather high heel knee boots and a big furry white coat. No belt needed for me :)","21-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mixed-print-midi?color=000","Aluap","Beautiful cut, material creases too easily","This dress is a beautiful fit, and so pretty. However, it creases way too easily.

The color is definitely bright mustard yellow rather than a true animal print tan, but that added to the fun.

That being said, I received this jacket from Nuuly as a substitute item because they were out of the item I actually ordered. My initial reaction was confusion— as this is not at all my style AT ALL and I would not be caught dead in this coat. I consulted the opinion of my much younger fashionable friends and they told me to burn in. Probably because it’s like green. The actual jacket is high quality on the outside and feels amazing. The inside lining appears to be made of gray Jersey knit sheets which is so strange. If I was much younger and this jacket was not LIME GREEN I’d definitely attempt to rock it out in public.","29-Dec-2019"

The coat was also shapeless, and to be quite frank it made me feel/look like a potato. To make matters worse, the red color of the coat shed EVERYWHERE. I had mistakenly thought that some of the other reviewers were being dramatic, but they weren’t... I had to lint-roller EVERYTHING this jacket touched to get rid of all the red-color fur.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-faux-fur-coat?color=015","KCS","Great fit, but sheds","Let me start by saying I was thrilled with the way this fit. I have a hard time with coats, being a size L petite on top and 16/16W on the bottom. We all know we don't wear faux-fur coats for the warmth but for the fashion - but this one was plenty warm for that high-30s, low-40s weather, and I personally love the fact it hooked in the front instead of buttoning. That extra inch you get with hooks and not buttons is crucial when you're shaped like I am, and it fit very well. Nice hidden pockets, and the fur was just the right pile height, not adding weight. However, perhaps because it was new? This shed like CRAZY. I took it off at the restaurant after showing it off to my girlfriends and was literally covered head to foot in red fuzz from the inside fur lining. So, just beware - bring a lint roller! I ended up not wearing it the rest of the day for that reason, which was a bit disappointing. Perhaps this wouldn't be a problem after it's dry cleaned a few times, only time would tell. But the fit was great, and the colors are nice and vibrant, like the photo. Just be prepared for the shedding! :)","16-Dec-2019"

There's no way it would have stayed on my body, so I never go to wear it out. I don't have super skinny arms either.","16-Dec-2019"

As the other reviewer said - this runs big. I am between an XS/S and got the S. I almost thought that the arm holes got stretched out over time because they just hang there and you can even see the lining when they lay on your arms. The same goes with the back banding, it hangs a bit. I was able to just make it sit low on my back to work. Overall the concept is cute - it just needs a lot more tailoring.","5-Dec-2019"

After unloading a can of dry shampoo on my hair, I pawed through my closet. Then I remembered I'd rented this dress from nuuly. Over my head it went. The self-tie belt looked great, so I didn't even have to think about adding another accessory. I pulled on slouchy knee-high tan suede boots that were about the color of the swirly pattern in the dress, grabbed a pair of dangly gold earrings and a thin gold necklace, and ran out the door. Many compliments on my outfit that day. Maybe I should never again lay out my clothes the night before...Rent this dress!","12-Feb-2020"

I love the print design and was eyeing this since it went up on the site. When it came time to fill my nuuly, the only size available was medium. I’m usually between a small/medium and think the small would have definitely fit better. The medium was oversized on me but I still was able to wear it and not feel bad about it. It was maxi length on me so I was able to wear leggings underneath to stay warm on colder days. I wore it with black doc Martin boots and black biker jacket.","9-Feb-2020"

I ended up getting an XS based on the reviews and the fact that it's all that was available, but I think a S would have been perfect. The XS was the tiniest bit tight in the shoulders, but not uncomfortably so. I just loved the drama of this dress with the sleeves and full skirt. Would have bought if it wasn't for the heftier price tag (but that's a personal problem -- I think it's totally worth the price).

Always size down in this brand, I'm somewhere between an XS and a Small in dresses, I ordered an XS in this dress and while I'm totally ok with a little slouch, if they made an XXS that would have been perfect.","30-Jan-2020"

I am always a small which is what I ordered this in and it was way too tight. Its stretchy so I thought it would work but it just fit like a wetsuit.","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lenox-jumpsuit?color=001","MissOllie","Great Fit!","I could have used a small, just cuz I would have wanted a little tighter fit. But the Medium fit well too.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lenox-jumpsuit?color=001","Spinster","Sexy and fun!","Definitely a winner. I was a little worried about the sizing as my body type is a bit in-between (my top is a 2, my bottom is a 4) so I sized up to a small. It fit perfectly on the bottom but was a little large on top. Nothing too noticeable, but after a couple wears the material stretched a bit, making the top a little loose. That being said, I'm not sure how much I would like it if my legs were longer tbh. Lengthwise, I'm 5'6"", and the pants hang between 1-2"" above my ankles, which works for me perfectly. Bu if you have long legs, your forewarned they might fit more closely to your shin (though you could again, wear long boots over them and dodge that problem). Because its winter, I wore a pair of tights under it and knee-high black leather boots over it. Super warm. Though I wore this on non-client days to the office with my team (we're an all-woman creative shop) we have a super progressive and empowering environment. However, it's definitely sexy and tight enough that I wouldn't wear it if I worked in a co-ed environment or with clients.","7-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lenox-jumpsuit?color=001","Abecca","Sexy mechanic","V stretchy, flattering on the waist. I'm usually a small on top and a medium bottom, and went for a medium in this.

I had to zip over my chest because the zipper would pucker instead of laying flat when open, which made it look cheap and messy.","3-Mar-2020"

I'm 5'5"" and 175lbs and a large fit really well, but felt like I could have mayyyybe done a medium for a tighter fit. It was insanely comfortable with plenty of stretch and it was thick enough that I didn't need a jacket or anything in 60 degree weather.

I’m kind of obsessed with jumpsuits right now to begin with, but this one was just so versatile and fun. I ended up wearing it two weekends in a row because my husband loved it so much. If you are large chested (I’m a 34D/DD), the fit definitely accentuates the “girls”, but not in an inappropriate way. In fact, the whole jumpsuit is flattering. It’s a snug fit but stretchy, so it holds everything in and creates a slimming silhouette. I got compliments everywhere I went in this and will likely order it again.","4-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/prism-top?color=049","Emmylou","Versatile & playful","I wore this top a ton! It’s got those cute retro ski bunny vibes almost. I wore it under an oversized graphic tee or on its own. I love how versatile it was because I got to wear it with so many outfits! It’s not super warm on its own but that made it great for layering. If you want a more form fitting look maybe size down? I got my normal size and didn’t mind how it was a bit loose and cozy.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I'm 5' 4"", 115 lbs and it fit like a glove. Pretty casual and slightly worn-looking in the torso fabric but fun to pair with bright eye makeup. There are pretty metallic threads than run throughout the sweater arms.","29-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/prism-top?color=049","peachy94","Comfortable, Dressy or Casual","Fit: Plenty of room in the shoulders while still being loosely fitted through the body. It is like a thermal, thin but warm. A little long on me (several inches past my hips), but I have a shorter body. Feel: It isn't cotton but it is just as cozy. The white material is not irritating. The sleeves are various materials and not quite as soft, but still comfortable. Season: 20F with a coat to 60F. Overall: Great everyday top. I also wore it for a girls night out. Looks good with black pants or leggings. It does show a little bit of wear in the white (the material is a tad roughed up). I'm particular and probably the only one who noticed, and I would still rent the same top again. I plan to rent it in another color, I liked it a lot.","2-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/thermal-duo-cardigan?color=015","Emily_k","Not quite a cardigan","I was under the impression that this was going to be sweater/cardigan material based on the picture and name. This is more of a shirt, it’s like that waffle material. You can tell this item has been worn and washed a couple of times, as it’s kind of losing its shape. Other then that it’s a pretty basic shirt, easy to style with jeans. Definitely a casual look.","18-Mar-2020"

Luckily the Nuuly team was receptive to my feedback. The highlights for what didn't make the cut really include how small the cardigan is, I'm not sure how I'd style it. I really like a sexy, minimal look but I couldn't wear it on its own with my boob size, and honestly don't think a tank top would look right under such a thin cardigan even if I had smaller boobs. I would say anything above an A-cup needs a bra under, maybe a good triangle top?","3-Jan-2020"

It is beautiful but it is very robe like and the material is very heavy. I also got a small and it was too small for my bust and waist. It is a wrap dress where it comes around to cover the chest and tie, I could wrap it but my whole chest was on display. I normally am a small or medium in this type of dress and I chose the wrong size.","15-Dec-2019"

The dress is certainly pretty but is also really heavy. It fit me more like a robe and sort of swallowed me. Might fit/look better on larger chested women but for me was just underwhelming.","8-Dec-2019"

But it looked more like a bathrobe on me than a dress. I wanted to wear it to my company's holiday party, but I looked like I was coming to remind Ebenezer Scrooge about Christmases of yesteryear. Which maybe would be extremely appropriate for a holiday party? Either way, I think this would work amazing on a taller person, but it didn't work for my body, unfortunately. I would also say, size down.","5-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/carson-utility-skirt?color=001","KristinAmber","Wanted to love it","Such a strange piece. I was so excited to love this. But it would not work. I tried it around the house several times. The slit in the skirt is right between the legs--very odd placement. I tried moving it around, but then the pockets were wonky.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/carson-utility-skirt?color=001","awc123","Doesn’t lay flat","Besides running way too big, this dress doesn’t lay “flat” on the body. It has weird creasing/bunching, so it just looks weird. I tried everything to fix it (steamer, laying flat over night, etc.) and nothing worked. Overall, just a weird skirt.","2-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/carson-utility-skirt?color=001","bananarama","Very stinky...","Was really excited about the ample pockets, but the skirt was just too loose in the waist and way too stinky. I’ve had this happen before with dyed leather, and unfortunately I think that the dye they chose made it smell like fish. I could smell it just walking into my room, so I definitely didn’t want to wear it around town smelling like I was hanging out at the fish market","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/carson-utility-skirt?color=001","KelseyM","Funky skirt","I really wanted to wear this skirt many times but it was way too big. The other reviews said to order down a size. I’m usually a 4/6 so I ordered a 4 but I absolutely needed a 2. Sad I couldn’t wear it","18-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/carson-utility-skirt?color=001","LW21","Runs big, but could be cute","I own other FP skirts in a size 6, so I was surprised this was so large on me. I had a solid few inches around the waist. I’m typically a 27 in jeans. I never wore it unfortunately but Maybe in a future month I’d order a 4. Be aware that the wraparound nature of the skirt means the top flap could fly open and you’d be exposed.","12-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/carson-utility-skirt?color=001","Lily1","way too big on me","i tried this but never wore it because it was too big. I think one size down on this would be good. the way it hung on me looked frumpy because of the sizing. i'm disappointed because it's a very cute skirt!","23-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/carson-utility-skirt?color=001","Katy","Solid","Its a cute skirt. Nothing too special. It does run big, even for FP, which I normally size down in anyways. If i rented this again I might size down again to a 2 (normally in FP I am a 4 and in most brands a 6).","6-Jan-2020"
