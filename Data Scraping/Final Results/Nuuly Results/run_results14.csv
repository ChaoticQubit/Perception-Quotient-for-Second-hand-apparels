"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","ReneeC","So cute- very 70s - very comfortable","It fit well layered over a sweatshirt but didn't look too big without. The tone on tone hardware makes it look super luxe and read more expensive than it is. One strange note, but not a deal breaker at all, I rented this in green and it was much more puffy, but this time with the mustard it was thinner... not sure if it just thins out as it's worn (and the green was new and this one was very loved?) Would absolutely buy but felt like weather is warming up.","11-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","MiniVanMama","Easy to wear, cozy and modern","Loved this coat. I have a 6 mos old and we're constantly going on outdoor walks. With the snap buttons it was so easy to throw on and run out to door. I wore it during some very cold days during New York winter and it kept me nice and toasty. It's on the shorter side so it barely covers your bottom. The high neck is soft and warm so you don't need a scarf.","24-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","HV","Cute but not stuffed evenly","This jacket is cute and comfy. The large was most definitely large. I thought it would allow for a nice big sweater underneath, which it did, and then some. Would've gone with a medium. I also wish the fill was distributed more evenly. It was like completely flat on the back of my neck but full at the front of the collar.","16-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","emily_","Everyone Loved This Coat","This is the perfect, oversized puffy coat. It came down to right around my hips and while the sleeves were puffy they weren't too long. This coat was heavy enough to keep me warm in almost freezing temperatures but light enough that I wasn't over heating when the weather was warmer. I wore this a lot and felt like the olive/army green color went with everything.","13-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","Bbuchs","So warm, cozy and trendy","This coat was all my winter dreams were made of. So incredibly soft and cozy.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","Carolynnkayy","Solid jacket","This was perfect for January in California. Would probably get it again. Would probably buy it but I’d like to test out a few other things first. Very soft. Not sure if oversized is the style or if it runs large but the sleeves were perfect and it was cute so I put true to size.","10-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","melxhoney","Size down","Usually, I buy my coats in a size medium so that it fits over my sweaters and layers.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","petitekt","Nice color, but cut wide","I really loved this color and the look of this puffer. length wise it fit me well, but it was really wide and made me look huge/let a lot of wind in. Wouldn't purchase, but was ok to occasionally wear open on a warmer day.","8-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","rachelelizabethknits","So cute!","I love this coat - it was cute over a sporty outfit for an athleisure look, and also equally cute with dresses or jeans! The color is definitely more of a VERY pale blue - looks white in the photo, and the color name description doesn't really help you understand what color it is. However, this was sooo cute and warm and I loved the fit of the collar especially!","30-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","Lehus","Comfy","I love this jacket. I should probably buy it, but I don’t really need to own any more. The color got complimented all the time and it’s so warm. The pockets are deep","30-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","Jans894","Could be cute but not for me","Supposed to be oversized but its too oversized and not very flattering. I have a petite frame and the sleeves are too long and its far too wide.","26-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","Allisonm71","Perfect puffer","Super cute puffer coat! Not as warm as i expected and the material you can tell is fragile so i was constantly making sure not to get anything on it! Its the type of material where anything could stick on it and ruin.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","lubby","Cute and easy to style","This puffer is great! I live in the Bay Area and it's perfect layered over a sweater for the California cold. It's also a little more fun than just a regular black puffer. Really cute!","16-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","kmoney","Liked, didn't love","I've been searching for THE black puffer, and this was close but not perfect. I'm usually somewhere between a small and a medium, ordered the small and it was still a bit too big. I also noticed that the stuffing is a bit uneven and I think it would only worsen over time.","6-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","GDFX3C","Like a marshmellow","I wore this ice skating with my husband and kids and it definitely kept me warm, however it really wasn't the most flattering piece on my 5'-3"" curvy body. It served it's purpose, and in Northern California, it was warm while still being breathable, which was a plus.","4-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weekender-puffer?color=070","nikaramorgan","Loved this light weight coat!!","I love this jacket. It a lightweight puffy that will keep you warm but isn't stuffy hot.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kessie-coat?color=020","hinseattle","Cool statement coat","This was a great rental piece. Very much a statement coat. It was a great color and had interesting texture. It was a little long for my taste, but I was happy wearing it a few times just for fun. I may rent again in the future.","30-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kessie-coat?color=020","Lilac3","Oversized","My fault for ordering a small. I can get away with a small most of the time but I was drowning in this coat. Would look so much better if I was a few inches taller too. I wore it anyways because it’s such a great coat. Warm enough for the Fall and Spring months.","22-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kessie-coat?color=020","kaleywp","Amazing coat","This coat is truly stunning. The color, the cut, and the fabric is very high quality. I wore it in NYC in 35-40 degree weather and was decently warm. Would definitely recommend!","14-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kessie-coat?color=020","afexlorbes","Amazing coat","FIRST, this coat has two sets of pockets (one set on the chest and one lower)! The pockets are not fake, they are basted shut if you received it new, which is standard for nice coats when they're getting transported so things don't get misshapen. I do think Nuuly should take care of this before sending out to people, because I had another coat with the same issue and it is a little confusing. It's easy to remove the stitch with your hands or a seam ripper if you're careful, and that is what I did because it's cold out here in the northwest! I wished this coat was camel, I loved the fit (a smidge snug in the shoulders but only if you wear chunky sweaters), the length, fabric, thinner lapel, placement of pockets, lining. Just couldn't pull the trigger on an orange coat if it was going to cost me this much and not be sure I'd wear it for years to come. But I will probably rent it again!","5-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kessie-coat?color=020","Hannah22","Arms are very tight","I loved the coat but had a hard time wearing sweaters with it. The arms and shoulders are super tight.","4-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kessie-coat?color=020","LaurenInCincinnati","Pretty but cheap.","It wrinkled super easily, was very thin and felt cheap. That said, it's a really pretty color and the cut was nice. Good for a rental, would definitely not buy.","2-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kessie-coat?color=020","MBrunsy1","Warm","I love this coat! Unfortunately Austin has been having a warm winter and it would look pretty silly wearing it in with how warm it is outside. Highly recommend if you live up north","16-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jannet-coat?color=011","Kristen_marie","Great color and style","This was a great coat, if I could have gotten the small, I would have.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jannet-coat?color=011","KristyLynnHeart","Beautiful coat, but color washed me out","The softest coat ever. Mine looked brand new.

So many compliments","I’m usually a solid color sweater type of girl, but this was a fun way to add color to my pretty neutral winter wardrobe.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/geometric-pullover?color=000","molly","Surprise hit!","This one ended up being my favorite of the month. It’s very soft and a relaxed fit, so was perfect for daytime and casual nights.

My figure is a work in progress and the boxy shape and added bulk didn’t do me any favors. The colors were nice, but I couldn’t get past the skin irritation it caused. I’m sensitive to even the slightest bit of wool. Next time I’ll be sure to read carefully.","21-Feb-2020"

They weren't super fitted or flattering, but I loved there the waist hit, and they looked super cute with a crop top. With a baggier top, they weren't as flattering - felt a bit boring. They were very comfy and fit perfectly. If anything, they probably run a bit small. I am anywhere between a 25-27 in jeans, and the 25 was perfect!","24-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/pinch-waist-high-rise-kick-straight-jeans?color=001","Emlaro","THE Jeans","I’ve now rented these a second time because I love them so much. The material is thick but not heavy and fits without being tight. The rise is high and flattering and the length hits perfectly just below the ankle. These aren’t stretchy, but they are incredibly comfortable, they sort of stretch to your body after the first or second wear. They are great for someone with actual shape in the butt-hip-thigh-calf areas. They go with anything and everything and I could probably easily wear them everyday. Sounds like I should probably buy these? I will say they could run long/wide on someone who is on the shorter side (mainly because I have the hardest time finding jeans that fit well in the leg/torso because of length.)","10-Mar-2020"

I've found Agolde to generally run large. In the light blue wash of this pinch waist style on Nuuly, I got a 28 (usually between 28-29 depending on brand). It bagged out pretty bad since it's a thin stretchy material, but still looked fine. In the black wash with this pair, I got a 27 and it was a little tight but loosened up to be a perfect fit. Also, the pockets sit very low on the butt, which I could do without. Overall, loved wearing these.","5-Feb-2020"

The hand feel on the denim is really nice and it was super comfortable on. I liked the button fly detail and the slightly faded wash on the denim as well. Tall girls take note! I'm 5'9 with longer legs and it was a bit on the short side for what I'd normally wear, but paired with a simple black tee along with Vans or Birks, it made the look feel more casual than bare.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/pop-pourri-posies-coat?color=015","Spinster","The coat that converted new customers to nuuly","This coat is such a killer statement piece! Every time I wore this coat out, women kept asking me where I got it from and I told them about nuuly (and gave them my discount code - gotta give and earn those referral points, Girls)! I wore the cost over the black jumpsuit I also ordered from nuuly most frequently, and also over a plain grey sweater and bluejeans (there's so much going on with the design I wanted to keep everything else understated). A great feature of this coat is that the cut and style is just so different from a lot of the styles in the states. It really reminded me more of the southeast Asian collared shirts I would wear as a kid. But the 'puffer' look and certain detailing elements were very western, giving it such a fresh and unique look. It really stood out. Would also just add that this coat was incredibly warm. It doesn't appear that way from the pictures, but I wore it out on a few colder nights here in Brooklyn and was very surprised at how warm I felt despite the wind and temperatures.","7-Mar-2020"

This jacket is so cute and is such a statement piece. It's fun because you can be casual while still looking dressed up and it takes away the problem of having to throw a boring jacket over your cute outfit. Instead the jacket is the statement. It looks like it's maaaayybee long enough be a dress style in the photo, but it is not, although it does a good job of covering your butt. The one caveat is that it does get little sparkles everywhere like a trail of fairy dust, which I didn't mind, but some might!","14-Feb-2020"

The actual coat is the comfiest, coziest thing I've ever put on my body. When I tried it on fresh out of the box, I wore it around my house for hours because I didn't want to take it off. I ended up wearing it so many times, I should probably buy it. It's very cozy but doesn't block the wind so on windy days, I layered a shell or sweater under it. The pockets are big, the neck can be pulled up, and the whole thing is so stylish. I got 1000% compliments everytime I wore it.","3-Feb-2020"

I got a L, which is my normal size, and it was comically large- think Macklemore's Thrift Shop. Despite its monstrosity, it was still cute enough that I wore it almost every single day. The elastic at the end of the sleeves was a lifesaver as someone with short arms. I wore it in DC, PA and Buffalo in January and was never once cold. I loved knowing I could wear pretty much anything, and if I threw on this jacket I'd be warm. Will most likely be re-ordering in a smaller size.","30-Jan-2020"

The actual coat is the comfiest, coziest thing I've ever put on my body. When I tried it on fresh out of the box, I wore it around my house for hours because I didn't want to take it off. I ended up wearing it so many times, I should probably buy it. It's very cozy but doesn't block the wind so on windy days, I layered a shell or sweater under it. The pockets are big, the neck can be pulled up, and the whole thing is so stylish. I got 1000% compliments everytime I wore it.","3-Feb-2020"

The material was amazingly soft and would make a nice bathrobe.","31-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tessa-teddy-coat?color=012","Margo","So cute and warm but SIZE DOWN TWICE!","After ""outgrowing"" most of the winter coats in my closet, I was afraid to heed the reviews and size down on this. I got a L, which is my normal size, and it was comically large- think Macklemore's Thrift Shop. Despite its monstrosity, it was still cute enough that I wore it almost every single day. The elastic at the end of the sleeves was a lifesaver as someone with short arms. I wore it in DC, PA and Buffalo in January and was never once cold. I loved knowing I could wear pretty much anything, and if I threw on this jacket I'd be warm. Will most likely be re-ordering in a smaller size.","30-Jan-2020"

It's so unique, the detailing is amazing, it has pockets, it is surprisingly wrinkle resistant, the material is not sheer + has a good weight to it, the fit is great + it is the evaluated cowgirl look I didn't even know was possible. The only two complaints are... One, I don't think the drawstring waist matched the chic-ness of the rest of the dress so I wore it belted (problem solved). And two, it's a unique dress, I wore it a gazillion times and now my family thinks this is the only item of clothing I own.

The dress fits so well and I got so many compliments on it within the first hour of wearing it. I paired it with white cowboy boots which made a fun look. I would be sure to not size up. I go between an extra small and small and even the XS felt a little big. If you are petite, it might not be the best dress to order because it could feel like to much fabric on a tiny frame.","29-Jan-2020"

My only complaint is that it is very very cropped so if you don’t want to show your tummy, you have to selective in how you style it. Otherwise it is perfect.

The brand is the same as Wildfox, so the material is really similar but softer. My only issue with it was that it was so comfortable I wanted to wear it 24/7, but the fabric pilled and started to look noticeably different the more I wore it.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-dream-sweater?color=048","acg117","So soft, fit more unique than expected","Loved the color and material of this, and I wore it unzipped on both sides to give it more of a sweatshirt dress look. I didn't like the way it cupped my butt when the zippers were zipped. I had a few gripes but none were major enough to affect my overall wear: 1) The neck looks looser on the model than in person. I normally opt for sweatshirts that are a little more scooped or v (or hooded) for comfort, and I found myself pulling a bit at the neck. 2) It is super bat-winged. Slightly annoying when pushing sleeves up that fabric was still hanging low and getting in the way. 3) Just the trim showed more wear & was pilled compared to the actual sweatshirt.","13-Apr-2020"

I wouldn't have sized up though because they are very flared on the bottom so any bigger and I probably would have looked like I was drowning in denim.

The dress was a little loose on the top and in the midsection - nothing that hung too loosely but it might have been nicer if the midsection were a little more fitted. I wore the dress to several events, including an entrepreneurs conference, for an interview, date night, and all-around Brooklyn on the weekend. It was perfect and felt really understated but ready for anything.","7-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/barton-sweatshirt?color=037","KCS","Oversized & Comfy","I really loved this one. The fabric is a little more structured than I was expecting from the photo, almost a flexible neoprene feel. This is a good thing, in my opinion, because it made the silhouette super flattering in structure and also wrinkle-resistant. This was totally wrinkle-free when it came out of the packaging. It is definitely oversized; I was surprised the L fit around the hips as I'm usually a 0X there. Again, the structured fabric is a godsend to a pear-shaped silhouette. Love the drawstring waist, making it very flattering even on a short-waisted torso. The collar I wasn't in love with; the stiffness made it lie a little strangely. Also, the sleeves were about 6 inches too long for my short arms. Had the sleeves been shorter, I would probably have kept this, however, as I loved it that much. Super flattering and comfortable, perfectly oversized. Definitely a favorite!","16-Jan-2020"

I was so excited with it straight out of the bag. However, the fit was odd and the collar didn't lay nicely. The fabric also wrinkled incredibly fast. It was a blouse I was hoping would make me feel put together, but I felt I had rolled out of bed when I wore it (even after ironing). It fit nicely in the arms and bust (my two most difficult areas for blouses) but there was so much access fabric throughout the midsection that it was impossible to tuck into jeans making me feel larger.","9-Feb-2020"
