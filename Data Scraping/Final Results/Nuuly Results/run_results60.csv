Definitely a different piece that will catch some eyes. There were some loose threads on the embroidering. Fit a little small","20-Mar-2020"

Worn to an 80‚Äôs rock themed party- but I‚Äôd totally wear it out any night! I ordered a large (usually a medium) and it was a little baggy, but could make it work no problem","24-Dec-2019"

The fit was perfect and I was really impressed with the quality. The lining on the inside makes this jacket a little warmer so its been perfect for the NYC weather that cant seem to make up its mind. I wore it to work and out and about and I got so many compliments. More unique Led Zeppelin pieces please :)","24-Nov-2019"

Everyone loved it despite how flashy it is - it's something about wearing a Zeppelin jacket I guess. SUPER SILKY! Hard to return. Intentionally runs large, even though I downsized to XS (Usually wear S) but I wouldn't have wanted it tight.","10-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/led-zeppelin-bomber?color=007","Arti","That 70s Look","This jacket is so very cool, and luckily for me, it perfectly matches a pair of silver booties I already own! I love the black rhinestone detailing on it, as well as the bit of silver bling on the cuffs. The sleeves do run a little short on me, but that's because I have long monkey arms. It isn't noticeable until I reach forward, though.","3-Nov-2019"

You can unbutton the lower buttons and tie it higher to make it more cropped and tight to the body. It does run a bit big, as it has a looser fit on me.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/day-off-buttondown?color=070","nverhoff","Super Soft & Cute!","Slightly sheer but I enjoy the look of vaguely seeing a the bra underneath, but this may not be for everyone. It is a super soft fabric and material. Very light--perfect for humid/hot summer days. In terms of fit, I prefer shirts like this to be a little over-sized. I might size up if you're not planning on tucking it into high-waisted jeans. It runs small over the hips and may not be super flattering un-tucked.","23-Mar-2020"

I am a big believer in all black everything, all year round, and this dress is perfect for super hot days when you want something light but maybe not color. Also, it's lined! Super light dresses that aren't lined can be v awkward, so that was a much-appreciated detail. However, I have pretty narrow shoulders and the small was a bit snug at the top, especially around the neckline and armholes. If I rent this piece again I will likely size up. This is the ONLY reason I am docking a star! In the meantime, I'm wearing this dress to the office, errands, out with friends AND bringing it on vacation.

The side buttons are an adorable details because they are all different and the high cut on the sides makes these easy to wear in warmer weather. But there is a sewn-in short underneath that is a bit suffocating and is the possible reason for bunching in the front where it falls loose. Waist fits tight. I am usually a small (27"" waist) and i was too uncomfortable after buttoning them to wear them. Maybe sizing up will result in a more comfortable fit all around.","8-Aug-2019"

These are soo comfy! And they look great. A vibrant red color pop for your wardrobe. The material is cool enough for a hot summer day in Texas with stylish side slits. I wore it to work several times and always got compliments on it. There were some button issues. I lost a side button. Seems that one wasn‚Äôt sewn on tight enough. Sometimes a few buttons come unbuttoned. The buttonholes may need to be sized down a bit to hold them in place better. This is a simple enough fix if you have basic sewing skills.

It's also incredibly comfortable, it was cozy for a day of zoom calls for work (#covid). If I bought it, I'd get it hemmed a bit because I'm shorter/petite, but the length was okay as midi for a rental.

They are not as cropped on me compared to the model ( I'm 5'6"" and they hit about an inch or so above my ankle, which I really liked ). They are a true high rise, hitting at the smallest part of my waist ( I wore a size Small and my waist measures 26"" and fit perfect without muffin-topping ). There isn't any elastic in the waistband and this worked out fine for me!

I wore it during the day while outside and for a night out and it felt perfect for either occasion. The length is perfect. However, I think the chest was a bit big on me.

Unfortunately this style just missed the mark for me. It was just a little too small to be comfortable in but I think that if I had sized up, it would have given it an oversized look and that's not what I was going for. Also the whole jacket was SO wrinkled, especially in the cuffs and hemline. I tried to iron it out but it just looked super cheap and bad.","12-Mar-2020"

Unfortunately this style just missed the mark for me. It was just a little too small to be comfortable in but I think that if I had sized up, it would have given it an oversized look and that's not what I was going for. Also the whole jacket was SO wrinkled, especially in the cuffs and hemline. I tried to iron it out but it just looked super cheap and bad.","12-Mar-2020"

Unfortunately this style just missed the mark for me. It was just a little too small to be comfortable in but I think that if I had sized up, it would have given it an oversized look and that's not what I was going for. Also the whole jacket was SO wrinkled, especially in the cuffs and hemline. I tried to iron it out but it just looked super cheap and bad.","12-Mar-2020"

Unfortunately this style just missed the mark for me. It was just a little too small to be comfortable in but I think that if I had sized up, it would have given it an oversized look and that's not what I was going for. Also the whole jacket was SO wrinkled, especially in the cuffs and hemline. I tried to iron it out but it just looked super cheap and bad.","12-Mar-2020"

Unfortunately this style just missed the mark for me. It was just a little too small to be comfortable in but I think that if I had sized up, it would have given it an oversized look and that's not what I was going for.

It is so cute and fun to wear, but not something I would want to invest in because I am sure I'd only wear it for a season before I got tired of it. I generally wear a small in most FP clothes, but I ordered a medium out of nerves. I think it worked fine, but a small probably would have fit better. I found myself thinking it fit a bit too big and wondering why, only to remember that I ordered a medium. I wore it with jeans to run around town in and leggings to hang out at the house. True to most FP styles, the arms were pretty long (especially for a petite person).","15-Jan-2020"

Due to the material though, it did get a bit wrinkled by the end of the day. I ended up wearing a cami underneath since the V was too low for my liking.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

This was easy to style with multiple looks and I wore it to work a lot. Im usually a Medium/Small and the Small size was a good call since it is an oversized style.","29-Sep-2019"

It's super lightweight so it's great for hotter weather. The bottom of the flutter sleeve is connected at the waist of the blouse, so it flows really nicely and has a lot of movement!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
