If you like your jeans shorts to sit lower on your hips, your usual size will work! If you like a higher-waisted fit, I suggest sizing down. Length is super short which is what this designer is known for so be prepared for lots of leg!","20-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mabel-printed-blouse?color=001","sheartay","Cute date top","I really liked this top, I wore it a bunch of times!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mabel-printed-blouse?color=001","nadroj","Runs big for Free People!","This top was *cute* but the quality was just meh! It had so much potential with some structure and cute design, but the fit was too loose. That being said I still made it work and wore it out to a nice dinner with jeans and heels, and then again working from home and running around town with clogs or flats. As a belled sleeve lover, good intro into this look. I recommend sizing down! Perhaps two sizes down if you don't have a big bust/arms.","24-Mar-2020"

Instantly regretted. Unflattering pattern and really just a bad color scheme going on. I really really wanted it to work and I was going to copy the light wash jean look the model in the picture is wearing but it just was not happening and my roommates agreed (I tried walking out the door with it on.) Also fit really huge everywhere.","22-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mabel-printed-blouse?color=001","willworkforclothes_","Dude, where's my boobs?","Was really excited for this top, it reminded me of last years ""Lolita"" top (which I own 2 in size large). I ordered the large based off of that sizing, however I'm not sure if there is just too much fabric up top, or if I needed to size down. I feel as though the waist was a good fit, but my boobs (which are kinda large) did NOT exist in this top. It was so strange! If you're between two sizes, order the smaller size and hopefully you'll have a better experience with this could-be-should-be beautiful top. Haven't worn it and won't :/","12-Mar-2020"

But the straps, torso and length were all SO long on me, it looked silly and didn’t fit well at all. I’m 5’4” with a short waist.

It's gathered to nip in the waist but didn't feel tight at all. Since it doesn't have any stretch and is cut a little narrow in the hips, I'd suggest sizing up if you have fuller hips. The armholes are a little low so there was a tiny peek of my bra when I lifted my arms - easily fixed with a cami or bandeau underneath!","19-Apr-2020"

It’s really soft and comfortable but cute and unlike anything I’ve ever really seen outside of the Midsommar costumes (speaking of which it would be perfect for a cult member Halloween costume). I have longer legs and this fits perfectly so I’m going to assume it runs a little bit long for shorter people, plus it’s a little see through but not bad.","13-May-2020"

Even so, it would definitely work with a skirt or under some overalls. I can not emphasize how comfy this shirt is I loved it! The small fit me well, not too oversized so if you want a more oversized feel then I would suggest to size up. It was baggy on me but not so much that it covered my butt.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/stones-flocked-leopard-tongue-tee?color=001","gogoose","soft and oversized","Super soft and comfortable, but as other reviews have noted, you'll likely want to size down. I ordered a small and it fit almost like a large. It's definitely a boxy, boyfriend type fit. Really fun to wear-- I'll probably rent this again.","30-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/stones-flocked-leopard-tongue-tee?color=001","chandlerlayne","Casual and so cute!","Loved this! It fit pretty true to size (maybe a little on the large side). I wore this multiple times and got lots of compliments on it.","14-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/stones-flocked-leopard-tongue-tee?color=001","Court91","Comfortable - soft","Loved this one. The perfect oversized tee. In tops, I usually wear a medium but knowing this is an oversized tee I ordered a small. The fit was great. If you're short, this will be on the longer side for you. But you can tuck it if you don't like wearing it long. I wore it both ways. Super versatile - I wore it to run errands as well as go out. Also, really soft material. Almost bought this one.","11-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/stones-flocked-leopard-tongue-tee?color=001","Genericwhitechick","Cool, relaxed tee","The material was very soft and I loved the design on the front. It is large and slouchy. May size down if I order this again.","8-Jan-2020"

Was a big though so harder to dress up. Looked a little slouchy. Could see it being easier to dress up if I had a long/lean body type. Would rent again in a smaller size.","4-Jan-2020"
