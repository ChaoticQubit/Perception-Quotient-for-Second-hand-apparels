I have pretty standard proportions and this hit in all the right place, accentuating the waist while also flattering my 5'5"" frame.

Wore it for an event. Might size up if I was to reorder but not sure if that would help. I think it’s just the cut on my body type. Petite length was perfect proportions for my frame tho.","16-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=043","TheDarlingM","True to Anthropologie sizing","This jumpsuit is the PERFECT mix of, like, power suit, and bohemian dream. The wide legs are flowy and not too long. The high waist fits me perfectly in the size 0, and in the waist size 0 tends to be snug on me, so if you have a tiny waist it'll feel great, but if you want it super nipped in you'll need to size down.","11-Jan-2020"

It is the most comfortable jumpsuit-I swear it feels like wearing pajamas. And yet it is stunning and statement-making. I get multiple compliments each time I wear it and feel like my best self. This does run small; I got a size larger than I ordinarily do and it fit perfectly.","8-Jan-2020"

I felt so good in it that I had the confidence to give the best presentation of my life. It is as comfy as pajamas yet looks like pure, fun elegance. I really wish I had an excuse to buy it. The fit is kinda as expected. I am normally an 8, but I went with the 10 because I am long waisted. That did the trick. The legs may be a bit long on some people, but nothing a good pair of shoes couldn't fix. And it did tend to wrinkle some like this fabric does. But that didn't take away from my love here.","7-Dec-2019"

My size had sold out at Anthropologie… So this was a good opportunity to get my hands on it. I love the fit and I love polkadots. I will say this runs very tailored and fitted… And the waist runs pretty small. I sized up to a 16 for this jumpsuit.","4-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=043","Kezzerj","Universally flattering","I've seen this jumpsuit on a lot of different body types and it seems to look great on everyone! I took my usual size 10 and it fit perfect. I was worried it might be too short on me, but it looked fine since the wide legs give a skirt-like appearance. The waist is fitted, so might want to consider sizing up if you are more hourglass shaped. I wore it to work and got lots of compliments.","4-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=043","katkat","Not my favorite","While this fit, it's really unflattering if you have curvy hips and thighs. The length in the legs was awkwardly short, kind of looked like high waters.","3-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=043","cviv","Fun jumpsuit!","I liked this jumpsuit and it fit well. The legs are a very wide cut so it makes a bold statement.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=043","Em","Not fot me","It just wasn't for me. The arms were more fitted and it balloon in the shoulders in a weird way. It also hit my stomach in such a way that it made a big bulge under the waist. Very odd. Really cute garment that might work for others but was incredibly unflattering on me","22-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=043","VEU","Received several compliments throughout the workday.","A really great overall fit. I am 5’8” 142. I tried both the size 6 & 8. Ended up going with the 8. The 8 provided just a bit more blousing in the back, and the perfect amount of length. Really cute style.","19-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=043","Lindzlee","Unflattering for petite build","I am only 5’3” so could not pull off the larger scale polka dot pattern combined with the wide leg cut. The top was too big. I am smaller on the top than bottom so one piece anything is tough. I am sure would look great on taller, straighter figured people!","31-Aug-2019"

Wore it for an event. Might size up if I was to reorder but not sure if that would help. I think it’s just the cut on my body type. Petite length was perfect proportions for my frame tho.","16-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=001","TheDarlingM","True to Anthropologie sizing","This jumpsuit is the PERFECT mix of, like, power suit, and bohemian dream. The wide legs are flowy and not too long. The high waist fits me perfectly in the size 0, and in the waist size 0 tends to be snug on me, so if you have a tiny waist it'll feel great, but if you want it super nipped in you'll need to size down.","11-Jan-2020"

It is the most comfortable jumpsuit-I swear it feels like wearing pajamas. And yet it is stunning and statement-making. I get multiple compliments each time I wear it and feel like my best self. This does run small; I got a size larger than I ordinarily do and it fit perfectly.","8-Jan-2020"

I felt so good in it that I had the confidence to give the best presentation of my life. It is as comfy as pajamas yet looks like pure, fun elegance. I really wish I had an excuse to buy it. The fit is kinda as expected. I am normally an 8, but I went with the 10 because I am long waisted. That did the trick. The legs may be a bit long on some people, but nothing a good pair of shoes couldn't fix. And it did tend to wrinkle some like this fabric does. But that didn't take away from my love here.","7-Dec-2019"

My size had sold out at Anthropologie… So this was a good opportunity to get my hands on it. I love the fit and I love polkadots. I will say this runs very tailored and fitted… And the waist runs pretty small. I sized up to a 16 for this jumpsuit.","4-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=001","Kezzerj","Universally flattering","I've seen this jumpsuit on a lot of different body types and it seems to look great on everyone! I took my usual size 10 and it fit perfect. I was worried it might be too short on me, but it looked fine since the wide legs give a skirt-like appearance. The waist is fitted, so might want to consider sizing up if you are more hourglass shaped. I wore it to work and got lots of compliments.","4-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=001","katkat","Not my favorite","While this fit, it's really unflattering if you have curvy hips and thighs. The length in the legs was awkwardly short, kind of looked like high waters.","3-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=001","Em","Not fot me","It just wasn't for me. The arms were more fitted and it balloon in the shoulders in a weird way. It also hit my stomach in such a way that it made a big bulge under the waist. Very odd. Really cute garment that might work for others but was incredibly unflattering on me","22-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/loveland-wide-leg-jumpsuit?color=001","VEU","Received several compliments throughout the workday.","A really great overall fit. I am 5’8” 142.

I expected them to be similar to dark wash denim, but they’re closer to athlesiure. Still, definitely work appropriate if paired with the right stuff.

The fabric is an excellent quality and was thicker than I expected, so I think this dress would work really well in Fall or Spring when the weather is a little cooler.

It, obviously, fits loose but doesn't make you look heavier- the fabric is so lightweight that it lays against your body well. The pattern is great and there's fun detailing along the chest area. I also really liked the sleeve- it had some flowiness to it. I am 5' tall and got the petite and the length was right around the knees, which was perfect.","9-Apr-2020"

It did run very large (as other reviewers noted). I normally gravitate towards Large in dresses to accommodate my height, but went for Medium in this one because of the reviews. I was still swimming in it and felt it would've been a bit cuter if it hadn't been so loose. Overall it was a great pick though!","9-Apr-2020"

When in doubt, go down two sizes or order a petite and one size smaller. I am usually a XS/S and try to get a petite, but will size up in a petite to a small. SP was huge! Very long- hit right at knee and the butterfly sleeves combined with the flowy (ie lots of material) skirt drowned me. I still loved the print, so I put a jean jacket over the dress to provide me with some structure. Wished I had gotten a XSP!","12-Mar-2020"

If I were flatter chested or if the waist line was right under my chest, then this would have been really really cute. Instead it made me look much bigger because it didn't accentuate anything, and it wasn't a ""cute"" boho look going on.","21-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-khirma-puffer-jacket?color=015","Vermonty","Michelin Man","Nice fabric, very puffy, EXTREMELY cropped and the neck is not nearly as high as it looks on the model. More of a mock neck than a turtleneck. Suffice it to say that it kept me warm except for the waist and neck, which this coat did not cover. I do think it would be cute with a dress or skirt. But my husband tells me it’s not flattering on my hourglass figure and, therefore, not worth $1k. I looked more like the Michelin Man than I did like the model.","13-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-khirma-puffer-jacket?color=015","Itinerantd","Luxe feel but cropped and poofy","Like wearing a cropped comforter made of crisp cool linen. The front seemed poofier than the back which felt thin, this bit was annoying. But overall a stylish and unique take on a puffer coat.","14-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-khirma-puffer-jacket?color=015","CAL","really cute despite different fit","It is a slightly unique cut for a puffy down jacket, but I liked it and found a way to wear it. I would size down to a small (I'm usually right in between sizes and this one with its bulkyness would've been better in a small for me).","19-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sylvie-puffer-coat?color=009","Ninja","Very warm, loved the side slits and huge pockets","Only reason I didn't wear it more was because it was too warm.

Unfortunately/Fortunately the weather was pretty nice in upstate NY, when i received this coat. But once it got cold out this coat kept me so warm! I joked it was like a sleeping bag. The only part i had issues with was the buttons along each side. I had difficulty locating the pockets from time to time and would get my hand caught in the side buttons. But lovely coat, super warm and adorable pattern!","26-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rovita-tie-dye-kimono?color=000","Kariburafiki","Pretty, but definitely small","Beautiful colors, and the trim really elevates it. Wrinkles very easily. About sizing: So, I wear a size 6/8 bottom, and this wrap would not close. I would say it's a 2/4 size, rather than a ""one size"". Like, it's not even really a medium.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rovita-tie-dye-kimono?color=000","becca502","Love the colors! Runs small","This is described as ""one size"" but I would argue it wouldn't fit anyone above a size medium. I actually ended up tying the ties in the back underneath the back, so it wore more like a duster. I felt it looked more like a really short dress when it was tied, so it looked kind of weird over jeans.","30-Mar-2020"

But it's long","I rented this to wear on vacation over a bikini but my trip got cancelled so I wore at home as a robe. The material is nice and light.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rovita-tie-dye-kimono?color=000","VanessaV","One sizes does NOT fit all","So I guess it's one size in the sense that I could put it on and wear it open, but there was no way my size 10/12 self was able to wear this even remotely wrapped as intended.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rovita-tie-dye-kimono?color=000","fiore","Lovely, lightweight.","I rented it for a warm weather trip that was cancelled. Brand new, tags still on it. It is as thin as as sheet-but it is supposed to be! Great for layering over most anything. The detailing at the neck/edge is lovely, colors are beautiful. This simple piece looks high end.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/acid-wash-high-rise-jeans?color=092","oklyco","Love these jeans!","These jeans are great! I love the high rise, and the wash is beautiful. It's a rich blue denim and the acid wash isn't overwhelming--there's a slight 80s vibe, but I didn't feel like it was over the top. Very comfortable and fit true to size.","9-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/acid-wash-high-rise-jeans?color=092","victoriamorse","Not great for petite women","I really wanted to like these jeans because they looked so good on the model but did NOT work on my 5'4"" frame.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/acid-wash-high-rise-jeans?color=092","irisle","Not Very Flattering","They for sure run true to size if not a little big. I'm between a 25 and 26 and went with the 26. It was overall pretty comfy, but I could have sized down if I wanted them to fit tighter. The beef I have is that the description says they don't have stretch, but they actually are a cotton/poly blend. So, there is stretch. The acid wash looks very cheap (I assume due to the polyester blend). They are also not for short girls. Even though they're a crop length (which typically just means a mini crop for me) they were very awkward looking and wide (but not in a good way). Total bummer because they made my butt look great! I just couldn't pull off the rest of it.","9-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/high-rise-wide-leg-jeans?color=093","ShenAnniegans","Cute retro style that works for pear shapes!","I was worried about whether these would fit across the hips, since I am pear shape.

But when I tried it on it ended up the only item I disliked. The elastic around the waist bunches up in a strange way. It doesn’t lay straight, so it raises the dress higher than I’d like on one side. The dress’s waist, because of the ruching elastic, makes you like wider than you are. The fabric looks cheap in person, and has a strange sheen to it under certain lighting It’s also unlined. I wanted to love it, but I can’t even wear it outside the house.","5-Mar-2020"

Also, the model appears to be wearing the dress backwards in the photos - if you try to wear it the way it is shown you will have a giant tag in the front of the dress lining between your boobs.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/midnight-city-wide-leg-jeans?color=014","April","Dressy casual","Very wide leg, very high waist—also a bit long. I wore my dr martens with them and they were perfect. Different than any of my other wide leg pieces so I decided to buy.","18-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/midnight-city-wide-leg-jeans?color=014","Arizona1","Wish it worked!","I’m on the short side but these are extremely long. They dragged on the floor even with my 4 inch platforms. Also, the width of the leg at the bottom is more extreme than shown in the photo. The high waist and fitted hips are so flattering though so if you’re super tall you will love this look.","12-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/midnight-city-wide-leg-jeans?color=014","emzy","Size up","These didn't fit me - I want to try them again but I'll size up next time. They buttoned but gave me camel toe and were extremely tight at the hips and thighs so I didn't want to wear them out. The fabric was soft.","4-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/midnight-city-wide-leg-jeans?color=014","REGirl","great for tall people","I love the waist of the pants, they were very comfy and stylish, but we're about 3 inches too long on me.","4-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/basketweave-petra-dress?color=010","Jenna89","Beautiful dress","This really is a beautiful dress. The fabric is nice a thick (which I personally like but might not be the best for a hot summer day) and lays nicely. Of note the bust area fit pretty tight on me.","16-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/basketweave-petra-dress?color=010","TLOGAN","Perfect white dress","I got this for a rehearsal dinner, but unfortunately the wedding was postponed due to coronavirus closures. Seriously will rent this again! It was the perfect length for me at 5'4, so classy and refined. Top was a bit tight but not unmanageable.","29-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/basketweave-petra-dress?color=010","girlsgirlsgirls","Beautiful, but size up.","Stunning, but too tight in the bust for me to wear. Would definitely recommend but size up!","24-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/basketweave-petra-dress?color=010","Sadiejuliana","Beautiful dress!","Amazing dress but runs pretty small, I would recommend sizing up. I ordered my typical xs but it did not zip up over my bust and was tight in the armpits. If you are bigger chested I might even go up two sizes. I would totally rent again in my correct size!!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/basketweave-petra-dress?color=010","EOkie","Just no.","I was so excited for this dress -in pictures this it looks great and interesting, but in person, it feels like it was made from cheap sheets, so the basketweave detail on the bust is really odd. Great concept, but the fabric threw it off completely for me. I couldn't zip it all the way up, as the bust was too tight, but I wasn't mad because I wouldn't have worn it anyways.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/basketweave-petra-dress?color=010","Eliza","True to Size, Great for Graduation Celebration","high neckline with tie, quite fitted in the bust area, slight cap sleeve, ankle-length, lightweight cotton fabric","7-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kendra-dress?color=066","emci","Inconsistent proportions","Love the color, but the proportions are strange. I wear 36DD, the dress was too big around my boobs but tight around the ribs. If you have a large chest and small ribcage it might work better. The belt was too small, I wear a 12 in dresses usually and i could barely get it clasped on the last grommet hole. Again weird sizing on the belt, felt like a belt for smaller dress? The color is beautiful but the fabric is not very soft and a bit stiff. XL fit like id expect a m/l to fit.","18-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kendra-dress?color=066","heyamberrae","Gorgeous color & fab fit","Dress up or dress down... the perfect comfy statement dress. VERY comfortable, lots of compliments. Belt waist perfect for hourglass shape.","28-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kendra-dress?color=066","Kat31","Flattering and Fun","Very comfortable and easy dress. The color is so beautiful in person and it is a very fun and flattering cut. Sizing runs true and it is easy to dress up with wedges or down with sneakers. I am buying this! I love it.","25-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kendra-dress?color=066","KCW","So Pretty, but Weirdly Proportioned","I love the design of the dress, but the rib/top of waist button is super tight. kind of weirdly so compared to the rest of the dress and buttons. I think I could get away with the belt hiding it (it's pulling open slightly), but kind of not into the effort. Otherwise it's a beautiful color and design, and may be better suited for someone with a more narrow rib cage.","14-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kendra-dress?color=066","Stylesmith","Fits super super small","I love this dress on the model but couldn’t even do it up! Normally an XL in most Free People items (for example a dress and top in my last orders) but this was teeny. I couldn’t do up a single button between the mid thighs to bust. I had to check that I wasn’t sent the wrong size. I’m between a 14 and a 16 usually. I would say an XL would fit a 12 max in this dress.","8-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisa-lace-maxi-dress?color=011","MilaWynn","Lovely Lace Dress","I have LOVED wearing this dress. Many compliments every time. It's perfect for Spring. The lace details are lovely and the xs fit was perfect for my petite frame. I gave it 4 stars bc the slip has an awkward fit and (even when wearing the slip) the dress is a bit see through. Skin-tone undergarments are a MUST. Overall I highly recommend for its feminine boho flair!","20-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lisa-lace-maxi-dress?color=011","Kittygirl89","Sheer Little House on the Prairie Look","I'm on the fence about this dress. The neck line and top are stunning. But the skirt feels bulky and frumpy. The dress is sheer, and so is the under slip. Have to rock the nude undies or an extra slip to make it wearable.","2-Mar-2020"
