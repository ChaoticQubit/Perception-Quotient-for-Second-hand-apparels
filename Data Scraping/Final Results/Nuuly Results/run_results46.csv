For work I wore it with a skirt. It did arrive with a missing button on that sleeve. I wore it with the double sided tape to the sleeve.

I actually also rented the green skirt it is pictured with and wore it to work, but then changed into jeans and strappy shoes for drinks at night. Great transition piece. Easy to style with so much. Can never go wrong with leopard!","8-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/salma-embroidered-peasant-blouse?color=001","aspiringminimalist","Really cute, semi structured top","This top was nice because it was flowy but also felt structured up top which gave it a more dressy feel while still feeling comfortable. It was a little too small and I should have sized up but I just wore with high waisted jeans like a crop top.","15-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/salma-embroidered-peasant-blouse?color=001","Roo","Cute","This was a sweet top. It was quite wrinkled and never smoothed out so perhaps that's how it's supposed to look. The buttons on the arms were snug on my swimmer arms.","16-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/salma-embroidered-peasant-blouse?color=001","Jolill","Too wide","I was so excited but ordered too big. I was hoping the petite would balance it but it was just too big to where for regular events. The petite was perfect in the shoulders but it was just too big at the waist. Probably going to try 8P or 6R to see if I can purchase","29-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/salma-embroidered-peasant-blouse?color=001","Susan","Issue with the back","This top is super pretty, however, the gauzy fabric drapes oddly at the opening in the back. The fabric sticks out and I had to pin it shut in order to wear it.","20-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/modern-peasant-blouse?color=001","BrittB","Cute top but seemed like it had been worn and pressed a few times.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/modern-peasant-blouse?color=001","Catlady4life","More tentlike than it appears","Perhaps this runs a it large, but I was shocked at the amount of fabric when I tried this on. It really poofs out like a tent, which isn't apparent from the photo. Maybe try sizing down? Maybe this only works on tiny skinny people...definitely made me look larger than I already am- which was not what I was going for!","5-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/modern-peasant-blouse?color=001","Marlee","Small and stiff","I was really excited about this, but the fabric was totally different from what I expected. It is very stiff, and seems to defy gravity in an unflattering way. The front and back stick out in opposite directions rather than falling/skimming the body. I can normally wear a petite top, but the sleeves and length on this were just too short.","29-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/modern-peasant-blouse?color=001","smoona","Cute but not for me","This shirt is far too much fabric for my frame. The shirt wore me.","23-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/modern-peasant-blouse?color=001","Liveflower2814","Cute but stiff fabric","I thought this shirt would be more flown but it was a stiff cotton material that rented out at my waist making me look larger than I am. This would look cute on someone petite and straight figure.","19-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/modern-peasant-blouse?color=001","Michelle05","Not for me!","This too might work on someone who has a smaller chest but sat very awkwardly on my chest. It is stiff so it just sticks out.","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/modern-peasant-blouse?color=001","CallaLily","Clownish on me","This might look good on someone lanky, but unfortunately it looked clownish on me. The sleeves were beyond puffy.","27-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/modern-peasant-blouse?color=001","BrennaM","Odd fit","I wanted to love this top but it just didn’t work out. The material was a lot more stiff than I imagined and the ruffles were too much for me. I ended up looking very boxy in it.","14-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","deebz","Not as cool looking as I thought it would be","I wore this once to work. It almost felt frumpy. It looks good. I like it, but working in it for 8hrs didn't work for me. It would probably be great for another occasion, but with stay at home orders in effect, I didn't get to find out.","18-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","kmccartan","Runs Large","This dress is gorgeous and feels very expensive. The fabric is so luxe and the pattern is so cute. It does run large so I would suggest sizing down.","18-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","Hellosatch","Fully Lined, Love the Plaid!","I really loved this style. I did however, find that it ran a bit big. I could have sized down to a small and typically I am always a medium in dresses, it was just a bit big all around. I loved the print and loved that it was fully lined!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","NellieH","Flattering and Fun","Flattering dress, easy to style with boots and tights for winter. Would also look cute with sneaks but it was pretty long on me. I have rented this for two months!","31-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","CourtneyFach","Amazing! So flattering for post baby body","Loved this dress, very flattering on those post baby with a little extra. Wore with leather jacket and boots, I am more hippy and this worked beautifully!","19-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","kelliegee","When will I learn long dresses are not for me??","Thought this might be cute to wear around the holidays for work but the chest area hung loose and it was just too long for my height. Felt a little to Laura Ingalls Wilder and unfortunately I couldn't wear it.","17-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","leahtheodosis","Holiday Fun!","Loved this dress so much and wore it multiple times. It was comfortable and light, perfect for fall events and holidays. Only negative note was my bust size is small compared to my waist size. It had a little extra material on the top, but it didn't look bad. It was great!","5-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","NvrNuude","I must be missing the memo here","This was my least fav item this month. Maybe it's my body shape or my inability to accessorize this dress, but I just never felt comfortable or pretty, etc in it. I have smaller hips, and the bottom of this dress is pretty voluminous, so I never felt like it was doing me any favors. On top, it seemed to fit on the snug side. The material is to die for. I love the pattern and it is so smooth. It feels like a million bucks.","25-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","daniriley","LOVE.","This was a fun fall dress. I had so much fun wearing it. I was incredibly bloated while wearing it but it hid everything so well. This is true to size and it's wonderful!","25-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","Sharon","Walks the line","This dress is a little hard to style. I love its modesty, but the wrong shoe could send this dress into frumpy. I wore it once, it was really loose. Paired it with a denim vest to hide the extra room, and pink metallic converse. Couldn't get it quite right. The dress is lovely, though. Beautiful fabric, colors, and I love the plaid. Someone please post a picture of this dress looking chic!","19-Nov-2019"

The length and sleeves kept me warm even in my cold office. I loved how flowy the skirt of the dress was. I paired it with a braided black belt.","8-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","Kiki","Versatile and forgiving","I ordered up to be safe bc I’m between sizes. This runs slightly large- arms were a little long — and has an elasticized waist so is forgiving. Styled with a belt for more structure and could have dressed up or down. Loved it.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shelter-dress?color=052","Rachel","Love this dress! Long!","If you’re a taller girl like me this dress worked perfectly! It would be a maxi on anyone under 5”7 but I believe it’s available in petite! Wore to a fall bridal shower and felt very pretty in it! Debated between belting or going with a long necklace but either would have worked!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meridian-striped-tunic?color=049","susan230","Love","I loved this dress! very comfortable and easy to wear with heels or flats. It doesn't come with a slip, so make sure you have one available to wear with this.","22-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meridian-striped-tunic?color=049","Jolill","Really size down!","I should have listened! I sized down to the small (I’m always a true medium) but I totally could have done XS. It was a little flowy and boho for work but I still wore it a few times. It was perfect for a day of errands, coffee, and library study though. Wore with navy tights and black knee high boots","11-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meridian-striped-tunic?color=049","CaitB","Fun print and fit!","Liked this dress more than I expected.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meridian-striped-tunic?color=049","JulieHiggs","Love this dress!","Love this dress. It is a bit large but it still worked. The tie dye/floral imagery on the dress is very pretty. The material is very soft. A slip came with it because the dress is pretty see-thru. Very comfortable as well. Great for transition into Spring.","27-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meridian-striped-tunic?color=049","AshleyL","Gorgeous dress","I really loved this dress and would have worn it more but it was just a little too tent like, I would rent it again though and size down next time.","21-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meridian-striped-tunic?color=049","Swell","Cute, Comfy but Oversized!","This dress is super cute but go ahead and order two sizes down.

I typically wear a size small, so I ordered XS to make sure it would fit. I have rather long arms, but these sleeves went past my hands. It was also tough to keep the sweater on my shoulders. I paired it with a bralette and wore it as an off-the-shoulder top around the house with leggings. Not comfortable wearing it outside of the house to dinner or work because it was way too loose and revealing.","13-Mar-2020"

It was to the point where it looked silly if I even tried to push them up. I ordered a medium, and I don't even know if sizing down to a small would have fixed it. I think the problems stemmed from the overall design of the sweater, and the fabric/knit of the material. It encouraged stretching, rather than a material that would shrink back into place eventually.","3-Nov-2019"

I styled with high-waisted light wash jeans and booties. I have a pretty casual work dress code so this was great for the office, but would recommend more for a weekend look if your office is a bit more formal - tends to fall off the shoulders a bit.","3-Oct-2019"

Kind of that ethereal/cozy vibe, but maybe i was too ... small? I am quite petite, but the dimensions were really strange. Length was fine and was like any other moderately cropped top, but the sides were SO loose and the neckline so low that what seemed like yards of extra fabric just kinda flopped around a bunch and looked very strange. I tried with a bralette, with other layers, as a one-shoulder, but ... all just looked really big and unclear (LOL). I clearly don't have the body shape for this, but I am not sure if anyone does. Really sad because I loved the idea!","19-Dec-2019"

The sleeves are very long and uncomfortable, and the front is very short with a deep v. I'm fine with crop tops in general but this just doesn't work. I think if I actually tried to wear in and move around in it, my boob would come out somehow. It just doesn't seem like it was really made to fit a human haha.","11-Dec-2019"

It kept falling off my shoulders which would be okay except for the center seam makes it look a little weird. The fit was extremely boxy and loose, when you hold your arms out there's about an extra six inches of fabric on each sides. It is very sheer. Plan on wearing a bralette, and go down two sizes.

It was to the point where it looked silly if I even tried to push them up. I ordered a medium, and I don't even know if sizing down to a small would have fixed it. I think the problems stemmed from the overall design of the sweater, and the fabric/knit of the material. It encouraged stretching, rather than a material that would shrink back into place eventually.","3-Nov-2019"

I styled with high-waisted light wash jeans and booties. I have a pretty casual work dress code so this was great for the office, but would recommend more for a weekend look if your office is a bit more formal - tends to fall off the shoulders a bit.","3-Oct-2019"

The sleeves are incredibly long (assuming they are meant to be rolled) with a high high crop length.

Kind of that ethereal/cozy vibe, but maybe i was too ... small? I am quite petite, but the dimensions were really strange. Length was fine and was like any other moderately cropped top, but the sides were SO loose and the neckline so low that what seemed like yards of extra fabric just kinda flopped around a bunch and looked very strange. I tried with a bralette, with other layers, as a one-shoulder, but ... all just looked really big and unclear (LOL). I clearly don't have the body shape for this, but I am not sure if anyone does.

The sleeves are very long and uncomfortable, and the front is very short with a deep v. I'm fine with crop tops in general but this just doesn't work. I think if I actually tried to wear in and move around in it, my boob would come out somehow. It just doesn't seem like it was really made to fit a human haha.","11-Dec-2019"

It kept falling off my shoulders which would be okay except for the center seam makes it look a little weird. The fit was extremely boxy and loose, when you hold your arms out there's about an extra six inches of fabric on each sides. It is very sheer. Plan on wearing a bralette, and go down two sizes.

It was to the point where it looked silly if I even tried to push them up. I ordered a medium, and I don't even know if sizing down to a small would have fixed it. I think the problems stemmed from the overall design of the sweater, and the fabric/knit of the material. It encouraged stretching, rather than a material that would shrink back into place eventually.","3-Nov-2019"

I styled with high-waisted light wash jeans and booties.

It's usually hard for me to find a jumpsuit that is flattering and does not ride up at the crotch, but this one manages to be super comfortable and give my square body a bit of an hourglass appearance.

It's also very heavy and there is a lot of fabric used to make pleats on the shoulders, pockets on the breasts, derriere pockets and wide cut on the legs. I felt like I was swimming in heavy denim, but when I would catch a glimpse in a reflection, I thought it looked cute. The extra fabric made the waist look smaller somehow. I'm rather fit. If I was any bigger I don't know that I would appreciate the extra bulk. It's cute, but I didn't feel particularly comfortable in it.","22-Oct-2019"

I have a 29 inch waist but this thing would not close around my stomach in a size 12-- and the legs were humongous, so if I went any bigger I'd feel like a raver.

I must say that it isn't often when I can find a one piece that fits as well as this one did.

So the math on that is - true to size. That said, they're very stretchy and I couldn't really enjoy wearing them because they broke in too much throughout the day. Maybe a smaller size would have helped, but I think they'd still stretch out a bit.","21-Feb-2020"

A note regarding fit, I am tall with a ""boyish"" figure. I like things on the bigger side, especially in the winter when I'm layering. The medium was perfect for me but if you prefer a more fitted sweater, size accordingly. Ended up buying this.","8-Dec-2019"

That said, I got SO MANY compliments on this thing. It's light, thin and airy but feels very high quality. I'm normally a size 8 or 10 and the medium fit PERFECT. With a D chest I had to use the fabric tape to avoid a small gap, but there was plenty of fabric, just the way it laid. Highly recommend this for a special occasion or even to wear to work like I did. Would absolutely rent again and might regret not buying...","27-Sep-2019"

Be careful though - unless your chest is really small, you'll need to wear something underneath since it's so low cut. I paired it with a black turtle neck and it worked perfectly. The sleeves are very long too so you'll have to stay consious of them the whole night or risk getting them dirty. If you don't mind that, it's a great dress!","14-Jan-2020"

There was more stretch to the jeans that I thought, which makes them more like leggings than I thought. This is both great = they are super comfy and forgiving. And a little disappointing = they look/feel more casual and are not jeans that I would wear to work (even on a casual day, and I do have a casual workplace). On the plus side, despite being so stretchy, they did bounce back and I never felt like they over-stretched. The jeans did fit larger than I expected. (I think I might be between sizes in Universal Standard.) And the wash was more casual than I anticipated. I knew they would be a lighter blue (not dark jeans), but somehow they just seemed really casual to me and the color/wash wasn't my favorite.","17-Dec-2019"

There was more stretch to the jeans that I thought, which makes them more like leggings than I thought. This is both great = they are super comfy and forgiving. And a little disappointing = they look/feel more casual and are not jeans that I would wear to work (even on a casual day, and I do have a casual workplace). On the plus side, despite being so stretchy, they did bounce back and I never felt like they over-stretched. The jeans did fit larger than I expected. (I think I might be between sizes in Universal Standard.) And the wash was more casual than I anticipated. I knew they would be a lighter blue (not dark jeans), but somehow they just seemed really casual to me and the color/wash wasn't my favorite.","17-Dec-2019"

The downside for me is that it gets water spots very easily (just like, even a tiny splatter from washing your hands) and it's dry clean only so there really wasn't much I could do about it. It also kinda slips forward on my shoulders sometimes because of where the seams are, resulting it it being a little too revealing.

Also I ordered the leopard print of this style and received a floral one. Nuuly credited me for the error (thanks!) but I am not a huge fan of floral patterns to begin with. I still gave it a try but the fact that I had to keep pulling it down at the waist made it a no-go.","27-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandra-blouse?color=049","BlueLover","LOVE this flattering, comfortable blouse!","I'm 5'2"" and this blouse fit perfectly everywhere, which is an unusual quality for a non-petite-sized top. Ruched wrists ensured the sleeves were just the right length. A wide ruched waist hit at just the right place to camouflage my bit of extra tummy. The tie at the neck allowed me to adjust the neckline in the most flattering way for me--I tied it loosely so the bottom of the V was covered by the hanging ends of the bow. The crepe fabric drapes beautifully and is heavy enough to wear without a sweater on a cool Fall day. I wore this top with hunter green wide-leg crepe trousers and Everlane's block-heel Day Glove pump.","21-Nov-2019"

I got them in a 27 and I'm usually a solid 28, but the 28 would have been a little baggy, I think. I also rented the black version of these in a 28 and they were either super stretched out by the time they got to me, or the 28 really IS too big. The black pair seemed to be thinner as well, so I'm guessing they were stretched/worn out.","9-Jan-2020"

I am 5'2"" with bigger thighs and prefer a high waist. I'm really picky with a skinny ankle-- it needs to be tight and I hate when I wear jeans for a couple hours and they become loose. THESE WERE PERFECT. I might even say they are the best jeans I have ever put on my body. The fit was exactly what I needed-- high waisted enough to keep everything in place, nothing felt overly tight or snug, but was just snug enough that the jeans kept their shape while wearing. The wash is perfect and can be dressed up or down easily. The skinny ankle and length fit beautifully. It was like these jeans were made for me!

They fit perfectly (5'3"") and were comfortable. They weren't quite as high-waisted as I would have liked, and they got very loose throughout the day to the point that I was pulling them up. If I had liked the rest of my Nuuly, I probably would have worn these again, but as everything else didn't work, these jeans weren't worth holding on to and I just sent the whole thing back.","21-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ultra-high-rise-denim-leggings?color=093","LADYDJ","Fit like a glove...until they didn't!","These jeans were the right rise for me (up over my bellybutton) and had the perfect stretch level to fit awesomely in the legs, thighs, hips, and butt. But after about an hour, the waistline area loosened too much and the whole garment wanted to start falling down. I don't have a belt that worked with them, so when I wore them I just expected to yank them up every so often. I would've worn them more, but I really had to do the pantyhose yank up too often to make it worthwhile to wear. This all probably has to do with my bodyshape, so I don't want to dissuade anyone from trying them -- they are high quality with good stretch and showed no signs of wear. But if you have a hard time with waistbands being tight enough, I'd skip 'em.","30-Nov-2019"

I expected this top to fit looser, especially considering a ordered up a size. It was incredibly tight in all the wrong places and very short. I'm tall but my height is in my legs so I didn't expect this to be something I had to worry about. I typically wear a true 4, if not a 2 in some stores, so when the 6 simply did not fit, I was bummed to say the least. I was able to wear it under a blazer due to needing a shirt to wear but it was not ideal. Would not recommend to a friend due to size, but the color and fabric was nice/as expected.","10-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/averie-plaid-wide-leg-pants?color=095","Gem","Silky smooth and colorful!","I've worn these a few times already and may wear them again before they're returned. The fabric is silky smooth on the inside, which makes my day every time they swish around. The 10 waist is a little big for me, so they hang on my hips more than at my waist. But this allows the hemline to almost reach the ground in sneakers for me, which is exactly where I want it. I also prefer this size 10 so I can be sure the hips and thighs fit me, which can surprisingly be an issue in wide leg pants like these. The side pockets have a small opening, so they're not the easiest to slip your hands right into, but they're still functional. The pleats in front also easily hide a phone stashed in your pocket. The colors really pop too!","8-Oct-2019"

It was cropped in a way I wasn’t quite expecting, and the fabric was just a touch thicker than I expected so I was uncomfortable in the heat wave we were having and couldn’t wear it as much as I wanted to. Both of these things also made it challenging to layer, though, so I’m not sure it would have worked in chillier weather either. I like starting with the negatives, but there is so much that worked with this top! The sleeves are cute and the detailing along the neckline is really nice. Surprisingly (and oddly) enough, a cashier randomly complimented the shirt specifically for the neckline. The material is comfy, and I liked that I could easily roll up the end of the sleeve to adjust the length just a bit. I loved this!","10-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/billie-long-sleeve-tee?color=011","sallysimply","Love!","I loved this shirt! It was cropped in a way I wasn’t quite expecting, and the fabric was just a touch thicker than I expected so I was uncomfortable in the heat wave we were having and couldn’t wear it as much as I wanted to. Both of these things also made it challenging to layer, though, so I’m not sure it would have worked in chillier weather either. I like starting with the negatives, but there is so much that worked with this top! The sleeves are cute and the detailing along the neckline is really nice. Surprisingly (and oddly) enough, a cashier randomly complimented the shirt specifically for the neckline. The material is comfy, and I liked that I could easily roll up the end of the sleeve to adjust the length just a bit. I loved this!","10-Nov-2019"

It fit perfect on the top and was a great length but was way way too tight on my butt and hips and was too unflattering to wear.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/plaid-days-midi?color=005","SofiaM","Stylish and comfortable","This skirt is so pretty on - it's just the right amount of tight around the waist, and falls beautifully on hips. The fabric is heavier that I thought it would be, which was a nice surprise, especially with the chilly weather. It fits true to size, but it is very long. I am 5'5'' and it falls just above my ankles (which I like, but some people may be looking for more of a mid-calf length). So, unless you are model-tall, this will fit more like a maxi skirt. I have been wearing it with high heeled boots and am obsessed with how it looks. Yet another fab find on Nuuly!","30-Dec-2019"

That adds a little more Amish flavor to it than I was really looking for, but I made it work. The waist also runs small-- sz. 27/4 and I was happy with a medium. The fabric is a heavier cotton and very comfortable to layer up in the winter. The length was a little tricky to style, but overall I was happy to try out this skirt.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/plaid-days-midi?color=005","Anima09","TTS for me.","I'm giving this skirt a 5/5 in spite of the fact that it didn't fit me. I ordered up based on previous reviews. I am a 27/28 in denim and I've been dealing with a bit of weight gain lately, so I figured I'd go M rather than S. Mistake! It ended up being huge in the waist and more maxi than midi. Too bad, because it's a print that everyone could use around this time of year and it's so classic and feminine. Would also be fun to wear with a leather jacket. Give it a try and go with your true size unless your body type would dictate otherwise with high-waisted items. Sorry my image is so fuzzy- will still give you an idea of length.","6-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/plaid-days-midi?color=005","kyliestewart","Fun Retro Skirt","Other reviews told me to size up since the waist was very tiny, however the medium was big on my waist due to my naturally smaller waist. I was grateful that I did size up though because I wore this skirt on Thanksgiving and needed the extra room after stuffing my face. It is a floor length skirt though so if you want something more cropped I would recommend wearing heels with it. (I wore both heels and sneakers and it didn't drag on the floor)","4-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/plaid-days-midi?color=005","parisrose","Chic but runs long","Only reason it missed a star for me is the length, which I actually didn't mind when styled a certain way.

A few people noted the waist fitting snugly, but the S fit well - even a tiny bit loose which I fixed by belting at the waist.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The fur (which is removable) at the neckline is statement-making. The color is brighter than in the photos and makes the jacket even more of a statement and, IMO, a rare wear. I wore it to work with a white T, flared dark blue jeans and black pointy-toed ankle boots (3"" heel). My dangling earrings spent most of their time resting in the fur collar, so I'd replace them with studs if I wore the jacket again.","13-Nov-2019"

So naturally I wanted to pick this piece. Its just such a cute jacket and very eye-catching in my opinion. I wore it buttoned to start my work day, then unbuttoned with a black tank underneath and black jeans. Also the little black fur wrap around the collar is detachable, which is good to know if you're trying to make it a little less 'outerwear' and more appropriate to wear all day inside like I did. This is such a cute piece and I was really happy wearing it. Side note - it is slightly cropped so just be aware of that when pairing it with bottoms.","3-Nov-2019"

If you usually size up in jackets, no need to do that here. I usually size up but it’s very comfortably loose material so I wish I got my usual size in tops! Overall so fun! Pair with some black jeans or a silk top/dress! GLAMOROUS.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

Sleeves were a little long, but I'm petite so that makes sense. It still looked super cute, and had a boxy fit which I really like.","1-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","jsafferstein","So Cute but Not for Wintertime","Very cute but very heavy. So much so that I couldn't fit it under a jacket, which made this impractical for me to wear during the winter. Would be a totally great top layer for like 50-60 degree weather though! Was bummed I couldn't wear this more. Also, the inside isn't fuzzy like the outside.","10-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","meraai","top quality fleece","I wore this many times and LOVE the heavy warmness of it. It is a bit bulky in style but very cute looking. For sure the highest quality fleece jacket I have ever had the privilege of wearing.","12-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","LauraH","HUGE","I Love the color of this jacket and I wanted to love the jacket, but it just wasn't for me! I'm pretty small (5'2"", 130 lbs) and this jacket swallowed me! It's very very thick, it reminded me of a carhart. I ended up not wearing it because it looked so big and it made it uncomfortable to wear. If you're looking for something very warm and bulky, this is a good jacket! Not super flattering, but definitely warm.","10-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","BelleMama","Easy to wear, cozy jacket","Loved this oversized zip jacket! I wore it to barre or just running errands around town. The inside was not as soft as I would have liked but I received many compliments!","3-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","Gigibyte","Heavy Oversized Coat","So I ignored the other reviews that said this cost was heavy - and that was a mistake since I'm in Cali. It feels like I'm wearing a weighted blanket! Haha I can see this working as an oversized coat in cold weather but I didn't have a chance to wear it.","5-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","naticknuuly","Extremely warm and cozy","Not sure when the ideal time to where this fleece would be. I know I would get overheated if I wore it inside, but it's not breathable enough to wear on a walk either...","30-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","JJJ","Warm and a bit heavy","As other reviewers have mentioned, I was actually a little surprised by how heavy and warm this coat is. It worked well for New England fall and winter days. The color is really pretty. The cut is boxy and over-sized, and I thought it worked well for this type of coat. Casual and different than my ordinary fleece.","10-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","Thearaed","Weird textured lining","I only wore this gigantic jacket out to the car on a couple cold mornings. The lining made it very difficult to like. It’s scratchy and unnecessary.","29-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","lunar2228","Really sturdy/hefty jacket","Great quality. The fleece is thick and dense. The lining is nice because the fleece doesn’t get caught in the zipper unlike other “squishier” fleece jackets. It’s a very heavy duty jacket. I think it definitely looks better with the sleeve rolled up a bit. I usually wear a S or M depending on the fit I want for my clothing. For this I chose S, which fits, but I honestly could have gone for an XS too.","18-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","leggos","Good quality but HEAVY","I was super excited for this guy... but i think i would literally need to live in Norway to wear it comfortably in the fall. Super duper heavy, it's a real coat w/ lining - not exactly what I was thinking it would be, which was a squishy fleece. Definitely could size down. Color is very pretty and it definitely looks cool, I'm just not sure I should have ordered it this early in the season.","8-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","briii123","Size down for sure","Unfortunately I could not wear this because it overwhelmed my frame. I think it would but cute on someone taller! Also not as cozy as I imagined - the lining was really rough and itchy.","3-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/forever-fleece-jacket?color=040","Rachbrookes","Cozy and oversized!","I love the color of this! It fits oversized and is a lot thicker/warmer than I expected! It would be really good for winter, I’ll probably try it again once it gets a lot colder!","1-Oct-2019"
