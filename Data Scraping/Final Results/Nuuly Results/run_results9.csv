"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fuzzy-teddy-jacket?color=054","CAL","pretty color good fit","the only thing I didn't love was the material, it wasn't as soft as some teddy jackets and felt a little stiff to me. The color was very pretty and I did love the collar, it played just fine for me and could be brought up if you needed more neck protection.","27-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fuzzy-teddy-jacket?color=054","willworkforclothes_","Pop my colla","Jacket is super cute! Love the color and the vibe it throws off. Kinda reminds me of my bitmoji outfit, if you know what I'm talking about. Perfect for brunch or drinks & apps. Also very warm. Only issue is the collar is huge, fat, and tall! You have to play with it so it lays where you want. But beware, you may get some pink fuzzies floating into your mouth (unless of course you are also rocking the it-fashion item of the moment, a surgical face mask, lol).","12-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cambridge-knit-blazer?color=030","Mudmo","Knit double breasted jacket","LOVE this jacket. I'm keeping it. Stretchy knit so it's so comfortable, but looks polished. Could wear it up or down. I liked the longer length including the sleeves. The sleeves are nice and narrow, as are the shoulders, so it keeps it's feminine profile.","2-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cambridge-knit-blazer?color=030","Heynat","Cool blazer","Classic blazer, subtle coloring and fit was just slightly oversized which was what I expected. There are shoulder pads but they're not super bulky and give the blazer the right amount of structure without feeling too corporate. Pairs well with jeans and a tee or officewear.","17-Mar-2020"

It’s soft but the shoulder pads give it some nice structure. High recommend!","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cambridge-knit-blazer?color=030","dsataluri","Love this blazer!!","I absolutely loved this blazer. It brought pretty much any outfit I wore together and I got a ton of compliments on it. Super soft and stretchy material, and it falls below the hips which is great because you can wear leggings or joggers with it. I got a small and it was a *tad* oversized (in a good way) but could have gotten away with an XS if I wanted a slightly more tailored look. Overall, amazing rental!","11-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wellesley-pleated-peacoat?color=041","CurvyPetite","Nice and Classic","This was a very cute coat and not too heavy. It was just a little large so I suggest sizing done if you find that you are typically between two sizes. The sleeves are also long for the petite.","9-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wellesley-pleated-peacoat?color=041","KarenLL","Bell-shaped and stretchy","The images made this look more structured to me, like a blazer lengthened into a coat. It widens a lot from the shoulders down, though, so even though this fit great in the shoulders and sleeves for me, it looked like a poncho on (in a bad way). I could see it looking really cute on someone taller or broader.","5-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emilia-jacket?color=031","Kitnen","My All-Time Favorite!","I LOVE this jacket. I was hesitant to rent it because it's a linen blend. I hate linen and the way it wrinkles. But this is a soft blend that doesn't wrinkle TOO much -- and the edges have a wire sewn in to them so you can straighten the sides and pockets out when they curl up! I love that! This jacket was perfect for spring weather. Since it has ""lace"" ruffles, it classes up jeans (almost like a blazer) or tones down a spring dress. I usually wear an XS or S and the S worked fine for me because I always wore it as an outer layer. SUPER cute!","15-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emilia-jacket?color=031","Sandra","Tailored but boho jacket","This is SO cute! Very fitted but the linen fabric and lace ruffle made it look relaxed and casual. I wore this a lot and purchased it. Lots of complements.","11-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emilia-jacket?color=031","happyhappy","Nice little jacket","I liked this jacket but ended up only wearing it once. I probably would have worn it more if the weather was more like in the 60s. The lace-like detail at the bottom was unique.","24-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emilia-jacket?color=031","katwalk17","Really cute jacket","Super cute jacket and very versatile. The fit is perfect and the length is just what I wanted. The only issue is it is much less structured than I expected. I had to iron it once I got it so the pockets and layers weren't curled up, but the buttons still sagged and the belt wouldn't lie flat. Overall I did love this jacket.","18-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emilia-jacket?color=031","SarahT","Great Basic","I received multiple compliments on this one, including a couple of requests from friends to try it on for themselves. I would buy it for myself in a hot minute if the cost wasn’t so high.","17-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emilia-jacket?color=031","Banagal","Loved it!","I loved this jacket and would have purchased it, but ran out of time due to unpredictable occurrences and work. The weather became hot so I didn't wear a jacket. I should have purchased this one.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emilia-jacket?color=031","Mo5","Super cute but tight","Super cute. Free people usually runs big but in case I would have sized up on this. Definitely a fitted jacket. I’m planning on ordering it again but size up.","8-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emilia-jacket?color=031","AprilB","Great Jacket for Spring or Summer","I loved all the extra bits: the lovely buttons and lace. Plus, it was nice that you could cinch it at the waist. Wears like a neutral!","6-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/emilia-jacket?color=031","jross428","Cute, runs a little big","I wear a small in most shirts but often prefer a size medium in jackets for easy layering. I ordered a medium in this one and wished I would have ordered a small. It runs a little big. Overall, cute jacket and as pictured. It needed ironed when it arrived. Not cute enough to keep.","1-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/james-pullover?color=011","LBJ","Not My Jam","This looked awful on me. It's boxy and somehow also tight? The neck is a fun idea, but this just did not look any kind of good on me.","19-May-2020"

Could wear it only with the ""Peripheral High-Rise Jeans - C/meo Collective"" - so the length was fine, but the pair doesn't look good together.

I found people to be interested in it as it is rather unique. I wore it with jeans and leggings mostly. It is very comfortable. The shoulders were really loose on me. I could have gone down a size but typically like an oversized look.","9-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/james-pullover?color=011","living59","Short in the body and couldn't get the handkerchief to lay right","Was really excited about this top. I tried to wear it a couple of times and never liked it on my, no matter the pants or the way I did my hair that day. It was a bit too short in the body and fitted at the bottom, so it was riding up (even with super high rise) and I could get the handkerchief to lay right. Not nearly as cute as on the models.","3-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tash-relaxed-straight-jeans2?color=091","CheapFrills","Huge","I didn't know what size to get since the reviews were all over the place. I got my regular size and they are huge, unwearable. Size down 1 or 2 sizes. The tag says ""relaxed"". No stretch in the denim, which I like. Waist and hips are huge. Would be great jeans in the right size, on the right body (my thighs are probably just too big for these.)","13-May-2020"

They don’t stretch out so much they are unwearable, just need a wash after 3 wears.

This was picked for me by Nuuly as a replacement to another item that was out of inventory when I submitted my rental. I absolutely love it. It runs a little large so a small would have been better for me in my usual size-8, medium body. The fringe is slightly out of my comfort zone but just right for a rental!!","6-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/baggy-drawstring-wide-leg-jeans?color=092","Bri4nn3","SO COOL. Tempted to buy.","These aren't for everyone, but they were very much for me. I looked like a JNCO Jeans model and I was LIVING. They *do* run super big, so go 1-2 sizes down. I'm 5'4"", and if these were any longer, I'd be screwed. But I got lucky with the size 24 (oh, and the drawstring really helps you adjust the waist at least). Looks great with small crop tops to balance out the large bottom.","18-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/baggy-drawstring-wide-leg-jeans?color=092","KLeNell","Very cute! Very huge.","I loved these pants, but could have gone down two sizes honestly. I'm usually a 27-28, and the 28 had so much room I could four fingers in the waist line. Maybe the waist was supposed to be a pit puckered with the drawstring, but it was way too much. I also had to wear 3.5 inch platform clogs just to keep from tripping over the length. That being said, I had fun wearing them and got lots of compliments. One girl chased me down in a bar to tell me she loved the jeans. I might rent them again in a smaller size and see if I want to buy.","3-Mar-2020"

I am a true size 4 and I couldn't even come close to zipping this up at the bust - and I have a 32-inch flat chest. If anything, dresses are usually tight in the hips and too loose in the bust, but this was absurdly small. I was planning to wear it to a destination wedding and I'm pretty upset that now I can't. Guess it's time to start looking elsewhere :| If you're planning to rent this, I would size up at least one size, and if you have even moderately sized boobs plan to go up 2-3. There is absolutely no give in the material, but there is room to breathe in the hips, so no issues there.","14-Feb-2020"

I actually don't understand how they did it because the yarn is not knitted that tightly...a true mystery. It is definitely a little itchy but if you wear a long-sleeved shirt underneath it, it should be fine. The only other downside is that the fibers shed a bit and can get in your mouth and eyes.

This would fit best on a girl with boobs, a small waist, and not a big butt. I still loved this piece, though. I would definitely size up. I usually wear a Medium and I got a 10. It fit like a glove. The sleeves are super full, so if you have broad shoulders, I definitely wouldn't recommend this for you. Kind of takes adjusting throughout the day because the waist seam hits a little low (unless you're literally 5'10"")","10-Mar-2020"

The back was so loose, even when buttoned, that I looked like I had wings emerging from my shoulder blades. The balloon sleeves were unfortunately not flattering at all.

Unfortunately, it fits awkwardly. Unless you have a perfectly proportioned body something is going to be loose or too tight. My personal example - my hips and bottom are larger than my top. While the dress fit me perfectly through the waist down I had issues with the top half. The bust was waaaay too big and the shoulders were too wide. Super disappointed.

They still worked, I just prefer a more secure fit even for jeans that aren't a skinny fit. If you are 5'3"" (especially with short legs like mine) these are perfect but not at all a cropped jean.

I'm normally a 29/30 (Joe's, J Brand, Blank, American Eagle, etc.) but when it comes to AGOLDE I'm a 31/32. I know people say they size down in AGOLDE but I think it's the opposite as you get to larger size end of the spectrum. Kinda similar to Levi's for me.","12-Mar-2020"

My problem is with the fit. I am slightly taller at 5'7'' with a shorter torso and longer legs. This had a pretty cropped look on me (even though my torso is very short - I'm talking shorter than my 5'1'' friends) and then the waistband is so small it's incredibly unflattering and uncomfortable to even try to zip up. The sleeves are also like 2 inches short of being a full sleeve so it's slightly awkwardly inbetween a crop sleeve and a full sleeve. I would really only recommend this if you are very lean/thin or are very petite.","14-Feb-2020"

I'm like a 34B and I wish I got a small instead of a medium because it's pretty roomy. I paired it with white Docs and a jean jacket for work and loved late 80's early 90's vibe.

One thing I would critique is how short the second layer underneath was. The skirt itself is sheer and I was concerned all day that in the sun you could see my butt. Not sure if it was something that happened after someone washed it, (seems like that was the case). If the underneath layer was longer, would be five stars without a doubt!","5-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/iquitos-skirt?color=000","Gigi_","Sheer with short slip","Wore this twice. Once on a date and once to a daytime event with women of all ages. For the daytime event I had to wear a longer slip underneath because the fabric is very sheer in the light and the slip that is sown into the skirt came just below the butt cheek which I felt was uncomfortable around elderly women. The skirt has an elastic waistband and the fabric is flowy, so doubling up on the slip was not an issue. Overall this is a cute skirt, but realistically the retail price seems like it should be $60, not $600.","3-Mar-2020"

Don't believe that model and her ""I'm casually lifting this up to show its movement/my ankles"" pose! I'm 5'10"" and it hit me right where it should for a maxi skirt, while wearing slightly platformed sandals. Looks great with a fitted crop top at a party or with a jacket at work. It's got a slip inside but there's still a very alluring semi-transparent quality to the fabric which makes you feel like a supermodel in the setting sun. Get compliments! Wear it all the time!

It seriously looks good with every outfitand I had to force myself to not wear it 3 days in a row. The cut is really flattering and the sleeves are cute cuffed or left big. It's definitely not form fitting if that's what you're looking for, but it hangs really well. I've had some trial and error with button downs- I have a bigger chest and normally the buttons look wrong. Not the case with this shirt!!! So in love with it; had to buy it immediately.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hamilton-draped-gown?color=001","ModernMom","Elegant, chic, edgy but comfortable and modern!","Beautiful draping, extremely flattering. It accentuated my lower curves (hips and butt) and downplayed my upper curves (38D), which I love. The drape has a really cool flow that seemed to respond to simple movements like walking across the room. Plus, the kimono-type sleeves created a cool effect whenever I'd move my arms. The only issue I had, and it's slight, is that the zipper on the back ends literally at the top of my buttcrack, so it'd start to bunch up there, creating almost a tent at my butt. I'd have to pull the dress down to smooth it over, which was a little annoying but didn't happen often enough that it was a dealbreaker for me -- I ended up buying the dress because I couldn't find it new online, even on the retailer's site.","26-Mar-2020"

The fabric is very soft on the skin. The color is not a deep black as pictured, but more of a faded black. I didn’t like that at first, but the dress looked so good on, it was no longer an issue. The issue I had with this dress is that the white tag is sewn into the back seam of the dress, near the bottom, so you see it. Very odd. If I owned it, it would have been cut off immediately.","18-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lily-of-the-valley-midi-dress?color=067","lavitacarlita","concept is lovely, but execution is wonky","I wanted to love this dress because the idea of it is wonderful -- floaty, soft, feminine, casual but sleek -- but I found the fit in the bust to be super wonky to the point of it being impossible to actually wear. even though the rest of it fit fine, the triangular bust panel on each side gapes in a really weird way; the straps are thick but shaped awkwardly and still slip off easily, and I just couldn't figure out any way to deal with the shape problems so that the dress looked cute. I'm not shy about low-cut and cleavage-bearing styles by any means, but this wasn't designed in a way that made the bust look cute or sezy, it just felt misshapen and uncomfortable.

I'm between a L/XL, and the M fit perfectly. Oversized like a poncho should be, but the sleeves still fit on my arms even layered over a long-sleeved thermal. It is slit too high on the sides to wear without a layer, unless you're comfortable with your midriff showing. But it's not a heavy sweater, so I found it just right to wear on a chilly day with one layer - no jacket needed. The colors are beautiful, not too bright for someone like me (80% of my wardrobe is black!). The sleeves are a bit too long for my arms, but my arms are short; however, it adds to the cozy feel so I didn't mind that in this case. Definitely one of my favorites!","18-Feb-2020"

I wore it for an event with black boots and bare legs, but due to the temperature found it difficult to wear again, as it didn't look right with tights. Would 100% rent again in the summer, and wear with a cute pair of sandals. It fit really nicely and the material is very light and airy. The slit adds a touch of sexiness too. It's gorgeous!","2-Mar-2020"

It’s a super cute dress although my forearms (which are sooo skinny) could not fit in the arm if it was buttoned. I think this would look much cuter on someone that’s shorter and has more of an eclectic style. Not for me who 99% of the time wears black.","25-Feb-2020"

It would've looked too conservative or 'prairie girl' without the slit. And the belted waist is super flattering. I'm short-ish (5'4"") and the ruffles on the bottom were almost overwhelming, but not quite for my height and I definitely wear tall heels with it to make those ruffles not so overwhelming. I coupled it with the cropped pink vegan leather jacket and it was a wonderful fun outfit!","11-Feb-2020"

The color is off white and the material a burlap sack linen like texture. There is a slip inside which made it kind of too hot for really warm weather for me.","8-May-2020"

I wore it to my cousin's rehearsal dinner in Mexico and got a ton of compliments from guests and random strangers on the street. It's a head turner for sure and from what I understand, it's handmade/handsewn. If it wasn't so $$$, I would've definitely kept this as a statement dress to wear for special occasions. I ordered a size small and it fit well and I didn't have to keep adjusting it around the shoulders, stayed perfectly in place. ORDER IT!!","14-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexa-party-midi-dress?color=010","MaryKiley","Beautiful","The most incredible dress I’ve ever seen (besides my wedding dress). It’s very well made and looks amazing on. The fabric is a little heavy but I’d say that speaks for the quality of material. If anything I’d say size down more then you think. I got a medium and probably could have gotten a small (just had a baby and most things I’m a medium or large!)","4-Mar-2020"

This dress is gorgeous and so well made. The sleeves and skirt have a lot of volume so I feel it made me look wider but overall it is so beautiful. Make sure you have a fun party to go to :)","26-Feb-2020"
