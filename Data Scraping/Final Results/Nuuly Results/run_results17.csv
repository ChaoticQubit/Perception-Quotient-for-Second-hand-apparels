It was a bit better when wearing an undershirt, but the neck area was where it really got me. Still wore it a few times though because it was so fun!","20-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","Savvydawn","Versatile and cute!","This sweater is so cute and comfortable. It can be worn for day or night time events and I received compliments on both occasions. The torso was a bit short on me, but with high waist pants it worked out just fine!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","Ldubs","Wanted to love it more","I absolutely loved the way it looked when wearing it! The cut and style was great. It was just so, so, so, SO itchy. By the end of the day I was red around my neck from constantly scratching the neckline. It's too bad because I did love the way it looked.","16-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","LadyPonch","Into the Blue","My Nuuly philosophy is to always order a piece that you'd never take off. This one was it for me. It hit all my most important criteria: comfortable, works well with jeans, perfect for sitting in a cubicle all day but still wanting to feel good about myself.","13-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","NC","Itchy and Poofy","I wore this a couple times, but both times I was pulling at my collar because the fabric was a bit itchy for my liking. The sleeves are poofier than the photos show, and it ends a bit short for those with long torsos. I don't regret renting, but it also wasn't a hard decision to return. If you're sensitive to itchy fabrics, beware!","11-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","Kwike","Cute & Cozy","Loved the color, but the holes were a little strange and had to layer to make it work. Super cozy tho! Fit true to size, and hit the waist line just right :)","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","IAL27","Great Shape","Although a little itchy, this sweater is beautiful and has a great shape! Love the detailing, and the balloon sleeves. The hem is a bit tight, so i fold that up and under and wear it with high waisted pants without having to tuck the sweater in. Would wear this to work, or on a cozy weekend.","25-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","ekm540","So itchy!","Wayyy too itchy for me to wear. Plus it runs super small: from the picture it looks oversized, but it’s tight everywhere—and the way it’s cropped on top of that makes it look like it shrunk in the dryer. Beautiful color, such a shame it’s not more comfortable.","21-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","DD","Wanted to like this but it was really itchy","I was super itchy wearing this sweater. It's cute enough, but it rode up a lot (I do have a longish torso). It's also kind of holey because of the design, so I'd wear some sort of tank underneath but because it would ride up so much, it would always embarrassingly reveal my tank. I'm usually a size XS or S for a top, so if I had the chance, I might have tried the S instead.","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","ChezSimone","Pretty color, gaps in stitching","I never go for blue, even though I love the color. I was excited when I added this to my goodie bag. This sweater doesn't disappoint on the brightness! It's slightly cropped style fit well, looked good with high waisted jeans and was warm. Only complaint is the fabric is stitched in such a way that there are gaps in the fabric where whatever is underneath, skin or an undershirt, shows through. I wore twice with with a nude and white tank and didn't really love the look.","19-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","J-Ham","Love this sweater","Great sweater! I'd rented it previously in blue and loved it so much I thought I'd get the cream this time. Flattering fit, soft, comfortable and warm. The fabric doesn't seem to pill.","18-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","Amanda747r","Very pretty","Loved this sweater. The color and quality of fabric were perfect. The sleeves we just a touch too long. And I wish the length on the waist was slightly longer. It was borderline cropped, only went slightly lower than high waisted jeans. But still a beautiful top.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","whitehouseeml","Eh...","Ran large and short. Mohair type material that gets all over EVERYTHING.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","AnnaK","super cute but short waisted","I really liked this sweater and I wore it with a long silk skirt...i got lots of compliments on the outfit. In the picture it looks a little loose so I ordered the small. I should have gotten the medium but I made it work. V cute with skirts and high waisted jeans. The only con of this sweater is that it is a little itchy.","30-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","JulesEmma","great color, great shape","Beautiful color and fun piece. A little scratchy but not enough to stop me from wearing it. Shorter waisted so wear it with high-waisted pants or order a size up. Sleeves have plenty of room and are a bit flowy.","30-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","maiaelizaa","perfect fit, just a little itchy","this sweater fit perfectly and looked great with a lot of different pieces, but it was a little itchy. I was able to tolerate it fine but if that bugs you I wouldn't go for this.","29-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","AmyG","Great color but itchy","I’m in Texas so it wasn’t cold enough to wear this more than once. The color is beautiful and as pictured.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","lindseycat","Really cute, but itchy","I love the look of this sweater, it's a delicate style but still a substantial thickness so good for colder weather. The shape is great, loose but tight at the bottom and a little shorter so it looks great with high waisted pants. But, the fabric was too itchy for me. I wore it for one full day and almost couldn't bring myself to wear it again.","22-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","lmcbeth42","Cute and easy to wear","Flattering cut, I loved the pattern of the knit, and really cute sleeves. This was easy to wear with all kinds of outfits. It was hard to send back!","21-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/laura-sweater?color=011","Arren","Looks cool, comfy!","Although very itchy at first, this sweater became comfier and comfier as the day went on when I wore it.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sailor-cardigan?color=001","Emilyanne","Nothing special","I found this sweater to be rather boring. I love a good black sweater but this sweater didn’t do anything for me or my figure. It is quite thick which is nice and very warm!","23-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sailor-cardigan?color=001","Alpal","A keeper","My first nuuly purchase! This sweater goes with everything.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sailor-cardigan?color=001","ech","Great basic","This sweater is a fantastic basic cardi. Classic and fit really well. Love that it's 100% cotton too. Did start to pill a tiny bit, but nothing too noticeable. Would rent again and maybe buy in the future!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sailor-cardigan?color=001","hinseattle","Great everyday sweater","This sweater is nothing fancy, but I ended up wearing it over and over! It’s a nice take on a simple black cardigan—thicker knit and slightly cropped. I wore it on its own (buttoned all the way up) and with a shirt under it. It was very versatile. The only down side is that it “shed” when wearing certain types of clothes underneath. I think I will rent again to see if it was just that sweater I got. Highly recommend!","3-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","rathomson","short but cute!","suuuuch a cute sweater but really cropped. Since I'm taller, I definitely could not get away with it for work even with my highest waisted pants. Could wear over a dress for a cute work wear though!","19-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","FluffyBears","Super cool, super weird","This shirt is not for everyone. It is very cropped but because it's also very puffy, I liked that it was cropped to show some shape! I received so many compliments when I wore this shirt. Pair with some high-waisted jeans and you will definitely rock it!","26-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","beancall","Wtf","Why would anyone want to swear such an elaborate/chunky sweater as a crop top? The sweater is super cute until you realize it's made for a child. I found it to be a lot more cropped than it shows on the model.","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","stylemeannie","Cute crop, great sleeves","Loved this but the crop is shorter than you may think. I wore under a jumper for a really cute fit.","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","Juju7","Way too short","This would be so much cuter as a sweater that actually has a wide band that reaches the waist. It looks really silly with any kind of pants that aren't super high waisted. I solved the problem by wearing my leather OBI wrap belt but was difficult to keep the sweater tucked in.","24-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","eob1131","So cute, but very cropped","loved the overall style of this but it was a little short. wore it too a family gathering and still felt myself showing too much skin","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","breis","WAY CROPPED","I loved this. The color and sleeves and neck are awesome. But it's more the length of a sports bra than a cropped top. I couldn't raise my arms without showing my entire bra!","19-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","Zg","More cropped than it seems","This sweater would have been perfect if it was a tad longer. The crop was awkwardly short","15-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","Alysiamarie","Too cropped, and I love a crop!","I LOVED this sweater, like gorgeous color and super cool sleeves. BUT it was so cropped that even with my super high waisted jeans, it still showed some skin. And not in a ""catch a peak of skin when I lift my arms"" type of way, but in a ""the bottom of my bra is showing when I lift my arms"" way. Which I'm totally OK with - but not in the cold winter months in NYC.","10-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","MaryMargaret","Super Cropped","This sweater is super super cropped. Didn’t work for me at all. Maybe better for someone with a shorter torso, but I wouldn’t recommend it for someone on the taller side!","29-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","littleicarus","Not for everyone. Not for everyday. But I f*cking love it.","I'm amazed at how inexpensive this garment is for how wild and avant-garde it looks. I'm 5'10"" so it fits me a bit differently than the model in the photo. The color is flattering, the fabric is soft, and with a pair of high waisted jeans it's a look.","24-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","Touchofgrayblog","Made for short waists","I don’t know if it was my long torso or the sweater, but it barely went below my bra.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/puff-sleeve-turtleneck?color=069","kcwilcox12","Cute and unique!","Picked this sweater to step outside my comfort zone - the sleeves were actually really cute - my only wish is that it was a tiny bit longer, with high waisted pants it hits right at the top (is slightly cropped) - would size up if you don't want it to be form-fitting.

I wore it probably 3 times, and there was never any pilling (even around the arms, where sweaters like this ALWAYS pill). The material is super lightweight, soft, not at all itchy. I did wear a white cami under because the knit is a bit sheer, and also for added warmth.","5-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/east-coast-crop-flare-jeans?color=092","kaleywp","Nice Quality & Fit but Weird Length","I am personally a huge fan of Rollas jeans. I ordered up a size and they fit perfectly snug (I like my jeans on the tighter side). Sadly, this ""crop"" length basically hit right at my ankles and since they're flared it just looked dorky. I was hoping for them to be just a little more cropped. Would probably fit someone 5'8"" and above perfectly cropped or someone 5'4"" as regular jeans.","10-Apr-2020"

I CHOOSE to put these on instead of staying in my PJs. The material is super thick and structured, and I love the high waistline. Super flattering. I have a self described ""pencil body"" in that my waist and my hips are basically a straight line so if you have more hips the pants might be too restrictive. That said I could probably have gotten away with my usual 24 but everyone said to size up and given all the snacks I've been eating the 25s fit and are comfortable. Bought them!","7-Apr-2020"

I fell in love with the look and feel of these jeans the second I put them on. They're effortlessly comfy for jeans, and have the perfect color and high-waisted fit I was looking for. I don't typically wear flare jeans but have been looking to try, and these jeans were the perfect way to go if you are afraid to make the jump. For size comparison, the size was spot-on for me and I typically wear 4/6 in jeans from other brands. My go-to look was either wearing these jeans with a cropped tee or hoodie with Vans or pairing these with a flow-y top and casual boots!","22-Mar-2020"

I'm a true 32, and technically they did zip up and fit around my waist. Unfortunately I could not wear them out of the house for fear that my thighs and behind were going to rip open the poor seams. The issue is that even if I had had the option to go a size bigger, I feel like they would've been too big at my waist?

I wore this to some parades at Mardi Gras and it was SO fun! I got a million compliments!!! Some things you need to know about this fun piece are: - the shirt only ties slightly in the front, so like... if it unties/loosens your titties will show (I wore a bralette) - The sleeves around your wrists get a little itchy, but the shirt is otherwise lined and not itchy at all - expect LOTS of compliments! This shirt is amazing and so fun!","18-Feb-2020"

I sparkled and shined! The color is STUNNING and it's so flattering. I was worried the bow would come untied throughout the evening (bc it's what holds the top together) but it did not and it stayed snugly in place! GET IT U WONT REGRET IT.","7-Feb-2020"

I typically dance between a S and M and decided to get the M, since I didn't want it to be tight -- and the M was the right choice. Since it ties in the middle, you can really adjust how much you want to show. I like the look of it being a little looser, since it's such a showy piece. I'm 5'8, 32DD and 135# if that helps with your decision making. :)","3-Feb-2020"

It hit right at the waist and looked great with high-waisted black jeans or pants. It was a bit broad and perhaps not the most flattering, but it felt too good to deny. The only complaint was that it held the smell of the dry cleaning or whatever was used to clean it REALLY intensely. By the end of the month, it was much more bearable. I thought that this one would be a hit with my tiger-crazy toddler, but he hated the smell so much that he complained when I wore it.","23-Mar-2020"

I wanted to love it but the fit is very unflattering and awkward. The sleeves are super long which is fine, but it makes the shoulders bulky and rolling the sleeves doesn't help much. There is too much fabric in the torso just causing an unflattering, boxy look. It is extremely soft and I love the pattern, but I was never able to wear it. My best friend, dad and boyfriend all agreed I couldn't wear it out of the house. I have a really small chest, so if you're bustier I could see it potentially working.","28-Feb-2020"

First, it's worth noting that this is not a sweater knit. The fabric is more like fake fur. But back to the sleeves.

Like other reviewers, I found it to be a bit short, but it’s a crop top so that’s to be expected. I just wore it with high-waisted jeans. I’m not built like the model - life is too short to say no to nachos - and I was worried this may be the type of top that only looks good on a toothpick, but this seemed to fit my curves just right. The fabric is very high quality and buttery soft. If you’re bigger chested, this one is going to show off the girls for sure. My husband appreciated that ;-).

It was cute with and without a belt. I'm 5'1"", so this was more of a maxi length on me. It was a very easy fit - I probably could have sized down, but I don't mind things a bit oversized. It comes with a slip, which you definitely need because it's sheer and the armholes are low. The slip has adjustable straps which is nice.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

And 2) At 5'8"" with slim, but athletic build, I thought that this style of pants would be great. Boy, was I WRONG. They ballooned out in all the wrong places and tapered right at the ankle.

It took a while to get used to the neck but then it became one of the things I love about the sweater. It doesn’t flare at the hem like it looks on the model but I was fine with that. It is pilling a bit on the arms. Probably my fave Nuuly sweater so far.","22-Jan-2020"

I loved wearing this with just jeans and sneakers to work. The two downfalls are that the tinsel-looking threads will shed so something to bear in mind because you will leave sprinkles around but also as a 5'5 girl I didn't expect the sleeves to be so short.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hygge-cardigan4?color=023","LadyGodiva","Comfy warm sweater","I wore this a lot! I also 100p disagree that this item runs large and was fairly surprised when I put it on. I think reviewers often equate 'loose fit' or 'lots of fabric' with a 'runs large', but this truly does fit TTS. The sweater I received (XS/S, usual size S) fit my shoulders perfectly and the sleeve length also comes down to just my wrists. I am used to clothing, especially sweaters, actually going a bit past my wrists, so that was nice! It is insanely warm, comfortable, and has TONS of fabric. For me, because we're doing so many Zoom calls, I ended up having to take this off throughout the day to look a little more 'professional' - the amount of fabric along your shoulders actually makes it look a bit like a robe from the shoulders up. I like this sweater but not enough to buy it. Comfy and reasonably cute for quarantine thought!","22-Apr-2020"

I received it as a rental right before my quarantining due to COVID-19, and have literally worn it everyday since I got it.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hygge-cardigan4?color=005","LadyGodiva","Comfy warm sweater","I wore this a lot! I also 100p disagree that this item runs large and was fairly surprised when I put it on. I think reviewers often equate 'loose fit' or 'lots of fabric' with a 'runs large', but this truly does fit TTS. The sweater I received (XS/S, usual size S) fit my shoulders perfectly and the sleeve length also comes down to just my wrists. I am used to clothing, especially sweaters, actually going a bit past my wrists, so that was nice! It is insanely warm, comfortable, and has TONS of fabric. For me, because we're doing so many Zoom calls, I ended up having to take this off throughout the day to look a little more 'professional' - the amount of fabric along your shoulders actually makes it look a bit like a robe from the shoulders up. I like this sweater but not enough to buy it. Comfy and reasonably cute for quarantine thought!","22-Apr-2020"

I know it's supposed to be baggy and comfortable and was ready for that, but I didn't feel confident when I wore it. I wish the sleeves stayed rolled, they kept coming undone on me.

In concept I love it so much and I did wear it a few times. I’ve taken off a few points though, mostly because if the waist got in the wrong spot it just looked matronly. And it got in the wrong spot frequently. We tried to get a good photo of it and really played with the waist. It looked best unhooked and pulled down as far as possible. But I don’t think that’s the point. If you're ok with that go for it! If not maybe try to size down? Sure is comfy though","21-Jan-2020"

I tried it on at Anthro and was so exited to see it on Nuuly. You could properly size down if you have a straight figure or narrow shoulders/waist. I normally wear a 14 and can squeeze into a 12 occasionally, but struggle with wrap style tops because of my large chest. The hook & eye closure actually stayed closed on this in the xl!","29-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ziggy-sweater?color=049","Arti","Perfect Transitional Sweater","I rented this sweater to wear with the “Waiting for the Sun” bells from the same brand. I ended up wearing this sweater a few times because it’s perfect for the kind of winter that we have here in California—the mornings are cold and you do need a sweater, but by afternoon, it sometimes gets too warm for thicker winter sweaters. If it weren’t so pricey, I’d buy it! FYI: Stoned Immaculate’s “Large” per their site is a US 8, so while I did click “true to size,” it’s not true to size for other brands that might set a “Large” at a US 12.","19-Jan-2020"

Which means when I reached for something my mid drift showed. Now for those of you that don't mind that - I would say go for it1 the top is darling. For me, I wasn't entirely in my comfort zone.

The high/low hem looked great with boots, and the high neck/elastic waist was just so flattering. I'm 5'4"" and don't really wear heels and the length still worked for me. The back was to the ground, but with the higher front hem it wasn't a trip hazard. The fabric is even more beautiful in person.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

Was a little bummed the zipper came not working (only unzipped halfway), so had to shimmy into it. Was so cute I dealt with it though. I would have bought likely if the zipper worked. Lovely dress and totally true to size.","26-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mirador-floral-dress?color=009","darling","Prettier in person, a little uncomfortable","Okay, this one exceeded my expectations. The floral details are soft and lustrous in person and the dress looks expensive. The attached slip took some finagling to sit right but was helpful since the dress is semi-sheer. Cons are that the wrists and neck are tight, so be aware if you're sensitive to that; sometimes it felt a bit choke-y to me. It fit true to size but I could see the cut being overwhelming or reading frumpy for some, as it's quite a lot of fabric and coverage. I liked it and could see it working in a few different seasons though!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/leni-knit-sweater?color=004","Del","Bought this because I was wearing it constantly","Loved this sweater for the color and the cut—especially because the sleeves ended right at my wrists and didn't have to cuff or roll them. It's got a very boxy shape and is pretty thick. Warm, fuzzy, but no shedding.","22-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/leni-knit-sweater?color=004","shapedupsam","Cozy, soft, versatile.","Super versatile sweater. It was on the boxier side which it the only reason I didn't buy it. Size up if you like baggier clothing. Thick and soft!","13-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/leni-knit-sweater?color=004","8RaeRae8","Great Sweater. PINK!","Last month I got this sweater in a cream color and absolutely loved it! This month I optioned to try to pink color. The color was a bit too pink for me, as I now know i prefer the cream color. However it is still an incredibly cozy sweater so I still wore it regularly!","10-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/leni-knit-sweater?color=004","MessieJessie","Soyftest Sweadah","This piece isn’t just a “soft sweater.” It is a Soyft Sweadah. You are guaranteed to receive more hugs while wearing, and you can wear it a lot! It’s off-white, which works conveniently with all denim colors. The shape is boxy and forgiving. Even if you have long arms and the sleeves are a little short (like they are on me), this shape is easy-going enough to look intentional! Versatility, fit, and comfort are all A+. Would recommend.","17-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/leni-knit-sweater?color=004","LAliving","Liked but didn’t love","This is a great, neutral sweater option. I really liked it but didn’t love it. The shorter wide sleeves made it feel a bit tunic-y but the length of the sweater is ideal. Wore it once but didn’t love enough to live in it or keep it, even though I thought I would!","17-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/leni-knit-sweater?color=004","J-Ham","True to size, but watch out if you're a true medium","I don't think M/L works for me and would recommend other true mediums think twice about this one. It's meant to be oversize, so I think a S/M wouldn't have worked well either. The shape is stiff, so I felt the size was unflattering because there wasn't much drape. I often love large, bag-like things, but not this one. Very soft and warm though, so it was comfortable for around the house, running errands, etc. I ended up not wearing it for the office as I had planned though as I just didn't feel confident in it.","10-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/truckers-mid-rise-straight-leg-jeans?color=093","Reepurpose","Fun & Colorful","These jeans would be awesome to wear in the spring. Because they are cut short, shorter than your typical bf jeans, I wore them with thick long socks and boots. It worked but I think you'd have more options in warmer temperature months. They have a baggier look in the legs and rear side but fit perfectly across my waist even though I am usually a 27-28 in jeans.","21-Jan-2020"
