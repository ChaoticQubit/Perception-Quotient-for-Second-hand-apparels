"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sami-puff-sleeved-sweatshirt?color=052","h3l1ok","I thought it would look better","The sleeve/shoulders were a bit bigger than i expected and the shirt fit short. It just sat bulky on me, not my favorite!","11-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sami-puff-sleeved-sweatshirt?color=052","mckenziekcole","It's Just About What You Pair It With!","This top was SO cute on when I paired it with athleisure pieces. However, the cut of it didn't pair as well with denim pieces. I wore it with high waisted Lululemon leggings and got ridiculous complements on the look. I also paired with with high waisted loose fitting shorts in a similar purple color. Overall, it is a great casual pick.","13-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sami-puff-sleeved-sweatshirt?color=052","MCgrit","Better for taller","It was okay for me. Something different to wear and comfortable, but not exactly flattering. Should have sized 2 down to an XS if it exists.","31-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sami-puff-sleeved-sweatshirt?color=052","LA","Thicker than it looks","I think it could be cute on someone else, but for me I looked super frumpy. I think maybe because the fabric is super thick, and the sleeves went further down and weren't tight enough to capture my form.","28-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sami-puff-sleeved-sweatshirt?color=052","Stphand","Nice transitional piece","I wore this a ton, mostly because it's perfect quarantine wear. It was slightly large on me, but not baggy, and it was very comfortable. It being short sleeved made it perfect for transitional Texas weather. If you have broad shoulders, the puff sleeves of this will probably accentuate them, they made me look fairly broad.","27-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sami-puff-sleeved-sweatshirt?color=052","MollH","Awkward sleeves and fit","The print is cute! But I tried to make this work, and it ended up being too big — not even cute tucked in. The sleeves were so oversized that it was awkward and I felt like the cut made me look bigger than I am.","11-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sami-puff-sleeved-sweatshirt?color=052","michellekg","It’s alright","The pros: it’s true to size, comfortable, and looks just like the photo. The cons: it’s an awkward shape. I couldn’t find the right way to wear it so I didn’t.","6-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sami-puff-sleeved-sweatshirt?color=052","LittleArtifacts","Unique and Fun to Wear","I loved this shirt and wore it a ton! It's super soft and the puff sleeves make it very unique. I would have bought it, but even the XXS I got was still too large for me. I'm 5""2"" with a small frame, and I know the style of this is a bit bigger, but it just wasn't quite a fit.","15-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sami-puff-sleeved-sweatshirt?color=052","HRae","Love it!","I really love this short sleeve sweatshirt. The material is incredible and the puff sleeves are very cute. I usually wear this shirt tucked into high-waisted jeans. It’s a bit long so there’s some bulk to it tucked in but I worked with it until it looked right. I get tons of compliments when I wear this.","11-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/massey-embroidered-top?color=041","CurvyPetite","Nice but a Little Shapeless","This top was a little outside the norm of what I normally wear. I would have liked for it to have a little more shape.","18-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/massey-embroidered-top?color=041","SFMamaBear","Cute blouse to dress up or down","This is a fun top but sadly it was a bit too narrow through the shoulders for me so it made it seem like the sleeves started too high up. That said, it's a great look with full sleeves but not overly puffy and a loose fit through the mid-section. My top did come with the corresponding undershirt; I had noted some reviews said it was missing from their shipment.","27-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/massey-embroidered-top?color=041","featherhead","Perfect fit","Great length and width for me. Fabric had substance but wasn't scratchy. The color isn't one I'd normally wear and washed me out a bit but I still liked it as something different. Would Love it (and probably buy it) in a more flattering color for me. Comes with a soft navy cami that isn't attached but you could also try something else under it for a different look.","18-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ariah-textured-cardigan?color=009","SofiaM","Beautiful but a little flimsy","I wanted to fall in love with this sweater, I really did. Every time I scrolled past it, it kept catching my eye until I finally put it in my Nuuly box. It is absolutely gorgeous - the mixed materials give it so much visual interest, and I received many compliments while wearing it. Strictly aesthetically speaking, this is the perfect sweater to give any outfit an instant statement upgrade. However, even when I first received it, some threads were coming loose, and the crocheting itself was not very tight, so the holes between the fabric were larger than I'd like (do not wear on a windy day or you will be freezing). It was a fun piece to add to my wardrobe rotation, but I would buy, as I do not believe it would stand the test of time - I feel like it would disintegrate within six months.","29-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ariah-textured-cardigan?color=009","jmomo","Puffy sleeve at wrist; otherwise great cardi","The colors, texture and design of this cardigan is great. I wore it a handful of times with black/greys. Got lots of compliments. The only thing I didn't love, and the reason why i gave it 4 vs 5 stars, is that the sleeve at the wrist is quite puffy. It didn't keep me from wearing it a lot though.","28-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ariah-textured-cardigan?color=009","Tastes57","Beautiful cardigan","Runs a bit big, but really pretty sweater with beautiful colors. The sparkly threads do tend to get caught on things and pull, which is my only complaint.","24-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/candice-bell-sleeved-sweater?color=068","Rooboomama","Beautiful sweater","I received lots of compliments on this sweater. It has beautiful colors and a shimmer to it.

It’s itchy, especially if you don’t wear anything underneath it. I wore it with a long sleeve shirt under it. The sleeves are huge bells too, so that can be kind of a pain.","23-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/candice-bell-sleeved-sweater?color=068","AmyL","Soft and flattering","I tend to like tops that don't cling to my middle and this one fit the bill.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/candice-bell-sleeved-sweater?color=068","Lipsy","Just not for me","Wanted to live this but it wasn’t flattering on me. Made me look bulky. I thought the length was awkward - would have looked much better if it’d have been shorter or longer instead it hit at that unflattering place where it gives you that thunder thigh look. Would look good on someone smaller.","19-Dec-2019"

Unique piece. I was thinking it was more like a sweatshirt, but it is actually a sweater knit, which makes it more polished but also just a little bit scratchy.

It ran true to size so was baggy on me, which is what I wanted for a slouchy look. The sleeves are beautiful but don’t fit under any jacket sleeves that are even remotely fitted, so I would recommend it as a fall-type sweater so you don’t need any jacket with it.","16-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nanette-faux-fur-cuffed-sweater?color=004","Sandra","Cute idea but too boxy","This was quite large and really hung on me but not in a good way. The cuffs are fun but looked a little cheap. Not flattering.","15-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nanette-faux-fur-cuffed-sweater?color=004","LaurenMorris","Cute idea but not great","Looked cute, but was just kind of weird to wear with a coat. Also the fur around the wrists would get all crunchy and weird from rubbing things.","12-Feb-2020"

But the fit was odd.it was almost a cropped fit in the front and the sleeves were very tight. Not sure if sizing up to XL would have made a difference if it were an option. I wore it several times with a gray shirt underneath to lengthen it in the front. May be a better fit for folks with a shorter torso. Cute concept, just not for my proportions.","31-Dec-2019"

The dress feels really baggy and unflattering on someone with a petite frame (takes away all natural curves), and the velvet pattern looks very ""old"" in person (and not in a cool, vintage-y way).

I think it had to do with the material around that shoulder/zipper area, and maybe the cut. It was Odd.

It would probably look great on someone with a smaller bra size but for me the whole smock section was my boobs. It made me look larger and pregnant.","21-Feb-2020"

I also had to keep moving the top of the dressed because the elastic kept bunching up around my shoulders.

I love the oversized cheetah, dramatic sleeves and for me it hits at a great length. BUT I am a little too busty for this dress. It fits, but it’s a little stretched out and makes me look a tiny bit pregnant. I still wore it, still loved it, but would be better on someone smaller up top.","16-Feb-2020"

I felt professional and very stylish. However... it was too long on me and not flattering. Unfortunately I realized it way too late (from pictures of me on stage after I spoke.). I felt like Mother Ginger looking at the photos.. I'm 5'4 and 130 lb. Dress ended up hitting in between my calf and ankle, and with the somewhat empire fit of it.. the skirt was just not flattering.","6-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/leopard-print-smocked-midi-dress?color=011","Myla","Fun but not very flattering.","I was really excited for this dress and as I suspect, I loved the print and the sleeves! It’s a statement piece because it’s a different silhouette. But, it made me look very big and someone even asked if I was pregnant. Maybe the lining adds to the fullness of the dress in all the wrong places but it also added warmth which, was nice for winter. I wore it once, maybe if I had sized down I would have liked it more.","17-Jan-2020"

I've gotten other English Factory items before that were a little snug, so I opted for the Medium here and it was a mistake. Size down.

No closure, so not ideal for windy days.","4-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sedona-wool-sweater-coat?color=009","Bettye","So Fun!","I LOVE this coat! They're calling it a sweater coat, but, being wool, I found it very warm and cozy and really wore it as a coat. It's very comfortable to wear as it's a stretch wool (somehow). I'm normally a 3x so this might be a little oversized...as even the 2x I got was roomy and comfortable. Unless it was a CRAZY cold day I would be able to wear this most of the winter. I ended up buying it directly from Anthropologie so I could take advantage of the Klarna payments. I've worn it four times already this January. It's just so fun!","26-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sedona-wool-sweater-coat?color=009","kmarshall","Gorgeous coat/sweater","This is such a beautiful, well made coat. It is heavy enough to wear as an outer layer over another sweater, or by itself as a sweater on a cold day. The horse print is stunning and the pressed wool creates a nice shape and hang. I used a large gold safety pin I had from another Anthro sweater to sometimes keep it closed, as there is no closure. Overall, amazing to rent and I'm thinking about buying.","21-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sedona-wool-sweater-coat?color=009","Jsich","LOVE","I loved this sweater!

I'm not into the super oversized look and would prefer something with just a bit less fabric which is why I say I'd size down. Regardless, got tons of compliments.

The rise works well for petite, and the length of the pants didn't need to be folded up. I mostly wear petite pants, that probably are about a 27-28 inseam. It hits at my ankles. It is more fitted in the ribs and bust, like a fitted shirt, but the weave gives and loosens after a wear. It's a softer denim.","30-Jan-2020"

The back is not as fitted as on the model, but since it has a waist, it has the effect of a tucked in shirt, but not too loose. The rise works well for petite, and the length of the pants didn't need to be folded up. I mostly wear petite pants, that probably are about a 27-28 inseam. It hits at my ankles. It is more fitted in the ribs and bust, like a fitted shirt, but the weave gives and loosens after a wear. It's a softer denim.","30-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/floral-sequin-lou-dress?color=009","Idub","Skimpier than you'd expect","This dress is great quality and beautiful, stunning really, but the fit was just not right. I usually wear these shape dresses well, but this one was too short to wear. The slit in the front rises very high and barely fell below my underwear. The dress was a lot shorter than i expected and i could not sit in it with out it showing all of my legs and butt. I would suggest this dress to someone with a more narrow lower half, slender or straight figure, and shorter legs. Also the top is very revealing. The neck line is very wide and spread apart which made it very tricky to wear without there being a wardrobe malfunction. Perhaps a bandeau would do the trick but you'd want something clean and simple that doesn't take away from the dress. In short, the bottom half fit small and the top half fit awkward. Would love to see someone rock this with a leather jacket! I know you're out there.","16-Jan-2020"

They definitely aren’t joggers - wide and open at the bottom. I think I would have been happier in a M, but then probably would have been too long.

It was huge, thick and warm - exactly what I was hoping for. I was disappointed that the fur neckline it's pictured with did NOT come with the coat and was pretty annoyed as it was a primary reason I ordered it. Aside from that overall the size was a little large for me, I am 5'2"" 140lbs and chose a medium, it fit in all places was just wide at the waist when buttoning. The buttons on the jacket were weird to, multiple ones but no tabs to button them in - just one in the middle, so fortunately comes with a waist tie that keeps it all together. Received lots of compliments, would love to have in my own collection, but I live in AZ so no need really.","26-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/viva-pleated-jumpsuit?color=001","ljospam3","This is BEAUTIFUL! The top is a little off, but workable.","I have never found a jumpsuit that I like—they usually hug my stomach too much to make me feel comfortable—but this one is GLORIOUS. I am a 14/16 on top and a 20/22 in bottoms, and this is snug enough up top to make me feel secure, but flowy enough at the bottom to fit all the junk in my trunk. I'm pretty sure I'm going to buy this one, because the only thing that stops it from being perfect is I need to tailor the straps to be a touch shorter (thank you small chest). I didn't have quite the cleavage issues that other reviewers did just because my bust is small compared to my size. The length was perfect. I am 5'9"", and I could probably wear 3"" heels in this without it looking like I'm waiting for the flood to come in.","12-May-2020"

I read a bunch of the reviews before adding it to my nuuly that said it was too long, but it fit my legs perfectly - just above the ankle as shown on the model. I have long legs, so it’s probably best suited for that body type. BUT! I had the same trouble with the bust that the reviewers did!! I have small boobs so figured it wouldn’t be a problem but it’s not a bust size problem, it’s a jumpsuit problem. I put a safety pin in it and some fashion tape but still felt weird. I’d have probably bought it if it weren’t for that.","10-Mar-2020"

It was gorgeous, flowy, and made me feel lovely. It fit almost perfectly except in the bust area—it would gap and ok weird when I hooked the clasp. So I decided to wear it open more as a deep V plunge look and safety pinned it so it wasn’t full blown crazy revealing.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/viva-pleated-jumpsuit?color=001","ewbnyc","Beautiful but not for short ladies","It fit great, but was 3"" too long, even with sky-high heels. If I owned it, I would take 1.5"" off the shoulder drop and then could MAYBE make it work without hemming (the rolled hem would be VERY expensive to tailor), but even so would likely need it shortened. That said, the fabric is lovely and very flattering and it would be great in any season for someone of the right proportions.","2-Jan-2020"

However, I wish it were available here in petite. Its long, not cropped on me. I wore 3"" heels and still it caught on my heel as I walked. Also, not boob friendly. The clasp gaped so much it was easier to wear a camisole than tinker with it. Will try again in a 16P if that becomes available. I will say the legs are AMAZING! Such a great jumpsuit.

Very cute dressed up for work or open with jeans for dinner. Typically between S-M in tops and got a small after reading the reviews, which fit great.

It said my size would be two sizes larger than I normally order, so I sized up. However, I should've ignored that because this was just too much. It was so oversized that I felt like I was playing dress up in my dad's wardrobe lol. I wore it once with the sleeves rolled and I still felt silly with it being so big in the width and shoulders. The Verdict: Cute and preppy, but if I order this again, I'll go with a large or xl if I want it *slightly* oversized. Definitely don't look up the size chart for this brand.","27-Jan-2020"

The S fit me like a normal blazer would, but this one is meant to be oversized so next time I will size up.","24-Feb-2020"

Easy to layer and also love the oversize look with a sexy tank. Perfect transitional blazer from day to nighttime - had to buy it!","23-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elegant-tweed-blazer?color=000","inhercloset1212","Great Quality","This blazer was almost like a jacket (super great quality/thick material). I wore it with skinny jeans and loafers (like the model). Great for layering a thin sweater or turtleneck underneath.","20-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elegant-tweed-blazer?color=000","drewacker","Perfect blazer","This blazer is the best - perfect length in the body and sleeves and the quality is great. It worked for me as a jacket, to dress up a maxi dress or to tailor a jean look. Definitely loved this one!","12-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elegant-tweed-blazer?color=000","HBS11","Runs very large","I ordered this blazer in my regular size (I like them a little oversized) so I can wear sweaters or sleeved tops under it comfortably but this was just way too big and wasn't as structured as I thought it would be. If you order this I would drop down a size or two.","10-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elegant-tweed-blazer?color=000","brittania1830","Obsessed","Super cute! Slightly oversized but it worked with skinny jeans. Definitely thicker than a traditional blazer and could be worn as a light jacket. Got a ton of compliments!","9-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elegant-tweed-blazer?color=000","MomCityStyle","Every other day","I tried really hard not to wear this every single day. Live in denim and it matched all my denim washes and was relaxed enough to wear sweaters, long sleeve shirts and tee’s under without feeling stuffed. Wore this with a red turtleneck dress and white booties. So many ways to wear, I had to buy this blazer!","4-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elegant-tweed-blazer?color=000","maggiefranz","Too bulky for a blazer, Wears more like a coat","This jacket is lovely but it's VERY thick. If I kept it on all day, I felt like I was just wearing my coat around the office, which does not look too professional, so I had to take it off and just wore it as a heavy jacket that day.","3-Feb-2020"

I wish I had sized down, but I still wore it a few times and got a lot of compliments on it. It's also pretty thick/heavy, so it's finely more of a winter blazer.","28-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elegant-tweed-blazer?color=000","somethingfrommyshelf","Cute but VERY Oversized","The Pros: great quality, great color combination, enough structure to be versatile enough for office wear and brunch with jeans, cute blue satin lining that showed when you rolled the sleeves The Cons: I looked up the size guide for this brand and I ordered the size based on that. It said my size would be two sizes larger than I normally order, so I sized up. However, I should've ignored that because this was just too much. It was so oversized that I felt like I was playing dress up in my dad's wardrobe lol. I wore it once with the sleeves rolled and I still felt silly with it being so big in the width and shoulders. The Verdict: Cute and preppy, but if I order this again, I'll go with a large or xl if I want it *slightly* oversized. Definitely don't look up the size chart for this brand.","27-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elegant-tweed-blazer?color=000","CJC","Gorgeous but big","Just like others have said, this runs big and is definitely more of a jacket than a blazer. It's very heavy and warm, it would be cute as a dressy coat. It was gorgeous and well made but I couldn't figure out how to style it.","14-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elegant-tweed-blazer?color=000","lauramaria","Runs really big","I know this blazer is supposed to be a little oversized, but even an xs was overwhelmingly large for me. The material is also really heavy, and it was too warm to wear inside. I would consider this more a coat or jacket than just a blazer.","10-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elegant-tweed-blazer?color=000","StylishTeacher","It's so fun but...","So I love the style of this! Very Chanel tweed! The fit was good- except for my usual problem of the sleeves being too long for me (this is just me). The only little thing that bugged me was that it was heavy. I guess you can chalk it up to the fabric and the lining. That may also just be me, but wanted to pass the info along.","8-Jan-2020"

I liked the weight and the feel of the fabric but it was pilling really aggressively within hours. One of the sleeve buttons also flew off. Wish the fabric quality was higher!","7-Jan-2020"
