I usually can handle a maxi dress with 3-4 inch heels/platforms, but this one was still dragging on the ground. Bummer because it is feels lovely and is very pretty!","13-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/getaway-maxi-dress?color=009","SocialParvoneh","Beautiful pattern!","Very comfy dress and easy to nurse in (love the maternity friendly sorting option, but would also really love a nursing friendly one!). The picture doesn’t do the pattern justice; the purple is more subtle in person and the print has a very 20’s vibe to it. Baby loved looking at it 😂 Very flattering cut and pretty details, comfy for wearing at home. Does run a little big; I can wear anywhere from a M–XL depending on the company, but the hips on this are pretty free so I’d probably size down to M next time.","7-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/getaway-maxi-dress?color=009","Charityhouston","Just not for me","I really didn’t personally care for this dress too much.. the material felt scratchy on my skin, and it just seemed really frumpy, on my body shape at least. But I should have known better, being I don’t normally like off the shoulder sleeves anyhow.. but I really wanted to love it- just wasn’t for me. Otherwise, a truly beautiful dress!","1-May-2020"

I am going to try a smaller size, as the sleeves were just a little bigger than was comfortable to wear all day (kept slipping off my shoulder).

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bianca-mini-dress?color=072","mdudzik","Cute little mini skirt dress","Such a cute dress. Runs a tad large on the top only. The skirt is short so it’s tough to decide what size to go with. I wore a small. I would not size down though. Just let it flow on top and wore a cute bralette with it. Wore many times. Perfect for spring/summer transition.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It is superrr poofy from the waist up, it looks like you have a bag on as a top and a weird skirt on bottom. Definitely not the best drop waist dress out there..","15-Mar-2020"

It is very comfortable and the colors are a lot of fun to wear. I got a small and it's a little big on me so I would say it runs a little bit large but I don't think I would have wanted to go down in size just because it is so comfortable.","10-Mar-2020"

There isnt any stretch and they were true to size if not just a bit small. I was a bit surprised but the thicker more rigid fabric but these were really cute. I may rent again. I liked them alot.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/arbor-wide-leg-pants?color=038","nuulyuser","Loved the pants but really large","I think these run really large. Wish I had known before I ordered! I have a smaller waist and bigger hips but the waist was at least 5 inches too big. They are very wide and roomy pants so I almost would have ordered a small instead.","13-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/natural-sights-overalls?color=014","Minapolo","SO comfy!","Will probably keep them. They’re comfy to run errands or wear to the beach or lunch or just to be home or anywhere lol. Paired it with a black strapless or fitted tank top- perfect for warm Miami weather! I’m short so I always worry about pants being too long but these were great, the tie straps might help with that a bit. Also I have wide hips so overalls don’t Always fit right but this is loose all around-no waistband, size large worked out perfectly.","17-May-2020"

Perhaps it was the tie-strings that were hard to get right (one strap was always shorter than the other, and I couldn't get the knots to sit at the same place on each side), but I also simply wasn't a fan of the fit.","5-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/natural-sights-overalls?color=014","Caseyfaith","Way oversized/sloppy","These overalls were way oversized and looked sloppy on me.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jeanies-tee-dress?color=001","laurenkelcie","Cute & Comfy","Loved this! It was a tad short on me, but with wider hips that's not that surprising. The fabric was so soft and I loved that it kind of tapers a bit in the waist so that it's still flattering.","6-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jeanies-tee-dress?color=001","TORRRR","Too Long","I loved the idea of this graphic tee and think the design is so cute. However, it truly is a ~dress~ fit. It is a slimmer fit for the width like a normal t shrit and extremely long. I even ordered it as a size up hoping it would give more of an oversized look but it still didnt. I guess true to its name but I was hoping for this to be more of an oversized graphic t style. It covers biker shorts and looks weird with leggings so when worn, it honestly looks like you are wearing a tshirt without pants. Just not my style","10-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/jeanies-tee-dress?color=001","Tayhetz","Size Down","Wish this fit better because I the love the look on the model. I am typically a Small and wish I would have sized down. The size small was too boxy and big and resembled more of an oversized sleep shirt than a t-shirt dress.","10-Apr-2020"

I'm contemplating on buying it, because I think I'd wear the crap out of it in the summer over some biker shorts. I'm usually a S or M, but I got a L for an extra oversized look, and it's super cute.

Felt a little short for me to wear as a dress because I have a big booty and I’m not used to wearing short dresses. I rocked it with some jeans and boots and felt casually cute. Perfectly slouchy.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ladybug-long-sleeve-top?color=060","HRae","Bright and Sexy","I liked it, then loved it, then liked it, and then didn't like it. I can't make up my mind with this top. The color is bright and eye-catching and the material is soft and stretchy. It's fitted and chest revealing making it ultra sexy. The strangeness is in the chest area. I didn't mind at all that it was low-cut but having a size 32D in the chest made this shirt fit strangely. I wasn't worried my tata's would come out at all, but I wasn't able to wear a bra or push up petals so the shirt was a bit unflattering in the chest area. I can only explain it as a very 70's style droopy look. It's hard to explain. Give it a go and see what you think.","20-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ladybug-long-sleeve-top?color=060","Snc325","So cute in photos, but not flattering","This too is beautiful and looks great on the model but if you have a medium to bigger bust area this is super revealing. The neckline goes super low and the chest area is a bit baggy, and I’m a little fuller up top so it was strange. The waist fit well and sleeves were nice though. Just a weird shape for my body!

I LOVE it and SO many compliments. It's pretty high waisted and runs just a bit larger than expected.

I got a lot of compliments on it, and it was easy to throw on anytime I didn’t know what else to wear. It is very oversized, so if you’re not into that kind of thing then it’s not for you.","18-Mar-2020"

There was a part in my thighs where it was tight to pull up, and once they were up, they were too baggy at my waist and then baggy all throughout my legs, snug nowhere. While a smaller size may have fit better, there's no way I could've gotten a smaller size up my thighs. I did like the stitching detail in the front. I'm giving them four stars because I think these could be awesome for someone with different shaped legs than me, but for me, they were probably actually a two-star.","14-Mar-2020"

They are very versatile and are just as cute with tennis shoes as they are with dressier boots/shoes. They are stretchy and pull on easily, but run a bit big.

Because they're so short, when I sat down (which wasn't comfortable since they were so tight), it was like my leg splooshed flat onto the chair in the most unattractive way possible, so even if I did get the 30 and they fit, they would be standing-only shorts (aka, I'd never wear them).

A 32 would have fit perfectly. Generally I am a 31 or 32 and I have found most of the 32 size jeans I have gotten were a bit loose so I took a gamble on the 31 here and I lost. But, I was still able to wear them a few times and I still really loved them and would highly recommend.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/daydream-about-us-blouse?color=011","sarah945","Not for larger folks, but beautiful fabric","If you are a person who wears a L/XL beware of this beautiful blouse. Mine came with the tags still on - amazing! - but that betrayed the real sizing. An XL in this brand is an AU 14, which is a US 10 (2-3 sizes smaller than a normal XL). I'm a true US size 14/16, and am happily wearing an XL in every other item I rented in my Nuuly this month with room to spare. Unfortunately, if you have the actual measurements of an XL, especially with broad shoulders, there is no way you can wear this piece. For smaller folks: the fabric is lovely, the detailing is exquisite (gold button accents, trendy puffed shoulders, neck bow, and a narrowed and gathered wrist seam). If you're looking something trendy for Zoom calls and have a narrower body type, I'd definitely recommend it, but size up!","24-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nina-knit-skirt?color=000","emmersto","Cute but too small","I really loved the pattern on the skirt but when all was said and done it was just too tight. The waistband is thick elastic and it kept getting twisted up inside so the waist didn't sit right. If you did get it to sit right, it just squeezed all the wrong areas and wasn't flattering.","31-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nina-knit-skirt?color=000","SamR","Cute but runs very small","Loved the skirt but couldn’t wear it because it was too tight on the waist and hips! Would definitely size up.","24-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nina-knit-skirt?color=000","mads16","Super cute, but runs small","I loved this skirt, but it ran very small. I typically wear a medium (either an 8 or 10), but ordered a large due to the other review that says it ran small. Even the large was tighter than expected.","23-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nina-knit-skirt?color=000","Winner","Flat tummies only","Definitely go up a size, maybe too. The waist is very tight/narrow. I wear a small in most things, but this made my size 2-4 body look very lumpy. It hugged in all the wrong places. Unfortunate because the colors are beautiful and I love the length. I’m going to see if I can salvage it with the right untucked shirt, but right now I’m not sure I can.","5-Mar-2020"
