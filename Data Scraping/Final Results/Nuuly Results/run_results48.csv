"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Luluahrose","The perfect coat.","This is a staple coat for your wardrobe. I loved this coat so much and would have purchased it if it wasn't so expensive. Wore it to work, out, errands...everywhere. The only downfall was the sleeves - they fit too tight to layer anything. I would rent again...and again...and again!","16-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","sarah945","Fantastic lightweight overcoat","This piece is as gorgeous as advertised, lined luxuriously, and clearly put together with impeccable draping. That said, it wrinkles when you so much as breathe, so don't bring it somewhere you want be able to hang it up!","14-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","turnermama","Pretty and easy to wear","Great fit and color. Not fully lined or super warm so it’s better for fall/spring than deep Winter.","29-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","eleonoreb","OMG!!!","This piece is gorgeous and fully justifies my Nuuly expenses. It's very luxurious and you will definitely get looks and compliments. It takes your whole outfit up a level. It wrinkles easily so be careful where you lay it. It's not meant for real winter weather, it's for cool crisp fall days or early spring. GORGEOUS. I am 5'10 and wore a s/m. It fit perfectly.","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Nsenfrida","Exactly what I wanted","It’s a light coat. Good with everything.","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Giraffe","Become wrinkly immediately","I like the style and the color. It's very thin and it works perfectly in my city. The downside of being thin is it become wrinkly immediately after sitting on it, put it on a chair, or anything other than just hanging it. It's quite annoying, not recommended.","23-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","ajc","Not a winter coat","super thin, almost like felt and definitely not worth the retail price.","19-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","KAK","Picture is better than reality","This coat is more for riding in taxis than facing the elements. Know when you rent it that it's a fashion piece, not a practical piece. Don't despair--there are many coats on Nuuly that are both fashionable AND keep you warm! Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.","13-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","angelaw","anytime, anywhere","I wore this coat too many times to count. It’s a great color that’s extremely versatile, and actually does a good job of keeping you warm. Awesome for cold weather over a sweater or cold-ish weather over a typical tee.","11-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","jsafferstein","XS/S Felt like an XXS","First of all, I would like to thank Nuuly for giving me the opportunity to wear a $600 coat. I felt like a million bucks in this and got tons of compliments - but could only wear it once because of how tight it was in the arms. Would be perfect in warmer weather, but I couldn't get it over any of my winter outfits except a tiny turtleneck so I had to wait for a relatively warm day. Will definitely size up if I rent again, which I plan to in the spring!","10-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","TXGator","Glad I rented this!","Great coat to wear w casual and dressy outfits so very versatile. Gave four stars instead of five because it wasn’t lined, which for the price is very surprising. I loved having this for milder winter weather.","10-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Owlmama","Perfection!","Is it possible to be in love with a coat! This coat was the perfect piece to add to my wardrobe. I wore it multiple times and received a number of compliments. I felt like a real New Yorker in my hometown of Baltimore sporting this gorgeous coat. It paired well with just about anything I wore. Seriously considering purchasing this one!","9-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","nuulygal","My favorite Nuuly","I have never loved a jacket more - will rent again. Would buy if I could afford it!!","9-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","tmorela","Beautiful and soft","Lovely soft coat that’s super versatile. Mine showed up with a hole in the pocket but otherwise was in great shape.","4-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Gigi_","Versatile","This coat is thin enough to wear indoors but also able to keep you warm outside. The shape is not great but the color goes with everything.","29-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","ink6","So cute and classy","loved it, got lots of compliments","24-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Lhlh23","Great for a night or day in the city","I styled this with all black outfits. From my sisters bridal fittings, night out with the girls, to downtown art events. All on cold winter nights ! It is very warm and I loved wearing it. I gave it 4 stars because I wish the camel hair was faux (I felt so guilty wearing it). I wish I had sized up though to a 2x because it was a little restrictive in the sleeves. Forgot to take any pictures in it and I wish I did!! It’s a great go to coat!","19-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Anreevesna","Great piece but needs a little work","I wore this coat on my trip to NYC. It was between 35-65 degrees while I was there and this kept me warm when layered with a body suit, sweater, coat, and a scarf. That being said, when I got it I was shocked by how thin it was. This coat is not really lined so you have to layer a lot more than you would with an actual winter coat. Another area where I ran into trouble was that the arms were way too short even when just wearing a random tank underneath. If you wanted to layer underneath then the arms get tighter and shorter. For reference, I'm 5'3 115 pounds so I have pretty short arms. On the plus side, it was light weight so it didn't weigh you down, and the color was great and fashionable. I did wear it many times and it was a really versatile piece.","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","cathpheebs","Best Coat all Winter","I loved this. If it wasn’t so expensive, I would’ve purchased it. The one I got seemed a biiit worn - some light pilling had started. But it looked amazing over almost everything I put it on top of. One of my fave Nuuly pieces to date.","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Genericwhitechick","Very Oversized","I wanted to love this coat but I felt like I was wearing a robe/ being swallowed whole when I wore it. It would probably work better on someone who is taller than me.","8-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Vera","Perfectly Petite","I LOVE this coat! It fit so well on my petite frame. At just under 5'2"", I had no worries that I woud be dragging a train or look like I draped a bulky wool blanket over myself. The color worked with everything that I wore, whether it was casual or more dressed up.","8-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","NewYorkerDetroiter","Great coat for style, not worth the money","For such an expensive coat, I expected more. The pockets had holes in them as well so were unusable. That said, the style was classy and I was able to wear several times.","8-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","NoelH","Love this coat!","This robe coat is the perfect lightweight coat, elevates and outfit and beautiful fabric and color.","2-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","stephsb","Classic cut","Such a classic cut. Great way to elevate any look. This is not a heavy coat. I was surprised that it wasn't lined. It may be due for a few repairs -- when I received it there was a hole in one pocket and along the inside of the left armhole.","28-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","MillieLove","Nice Jacket!","I am typically a 2x but ordered the 1x because of the other reviews stating the coat as oversized. The 1x unfortunately did not fit, waiting for the 2x to be available to rent :)","28-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Shelly","Classic and Flattering","This is truly the perfect casual-cool jacket. It is warm enough for moderate winter days outside, but light enough to add a chic layer to your indoor outfits.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Lilliegbennett","Great Staple","This coat is a great staple piece for your wardrobe because it will go with everything. I rented it for a weekend trip to Seattle and it was perfect for weather in the mid-40s. Definitely more of a fall coat! Even though I’m normally a small, the XS/S was still an oversized look on me.","18-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Bynthere","LOVED THIS COAT","This coat was Incredible! I wore this every day almost, didn’t get sick of it and always got compliments! Two notes, it’s real camel hair so I needed to wear long sleeves under it for comfort and there’s no belt to keep it closed.","12-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","mkmazer","Cheap","It didn’t fit well and the fabric was very cheap. Was extremely disappointed.","10-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","LoLoSF","Classy and Gorge","This piece stuns most, seriously. So in style and expensive looking. Great value. Complaint: it wrinkles so quickly yet oddly unwrinkles just as fast. Real complaint? Just got me nervous then actually stunned me. ;)","29-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","jesse","Staple piece!","It runs a little big - wish I would've gotten the XS/S instead of the M/L. But it was a great staple piece and I wore it all the time!","27-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Brylin","So warm and beautiful","Incredible coat and surprisingly very warm for how thin it is. Pretty sure I wore this 3+ a week.","20-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","jom","Dresses up an outfit","I wore this coat to work over a dress and out on the weekends with jeans and a fitted tee. It does run a bit large (I'm usually a M and was ok with S/XS) but I will say bc the sizing runs large I found the pockets to be weirdly further back than usual which indicates to me that its supposed to fit very loose.","18-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","CLab","Unflattering fit in shoulders of coat","Color & fabric quality of this coat were good - but the way it looked on especially in the shoulders/bust did not look right. It's extremely wide to the point of it being unflattering, and the collar fold is not proportional. Wanted to love, but tried it on and never wore.","17-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","ashleyjordan","A little different then expected!","First off want to say its a warm coat so that is a plus, however its a lot bigger then it looks on the model. Doesn't have much shape at all so defiantly size down if your looking to rent. Probably wouldn't rent again just cause of the lack of shape.","11-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Lifeisadventure","Stylish Fall Coat","This went well with almost any outfit! The coat wasn't as warm as I thought though.","5-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","JBig","Perfect piece for your wardrobe","Wore this almost every day—sometimes as light jacket, sometimes as a “blazer” at work. Lined nicely for layering. Compliments every. Single. Time. I wore it. I would buy it if it were on discount.","1-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","skghai","Great fall coat","This was my favorite coat but it is definitely lighter than I expected. It is good for fall and spring but won't hold up for winter at all. The fabric is great but the coat is not lined.","25-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","deapon","Waaayyy too baggy","Loved the idea of this jacket, but never ended up wearing it because it was way too big. I looked like I was drowning in all of the material, and it was rather thin and wrinkled easily. If you are looking for an oversized camel coat (without any closures or ties, either) then I would def size down. Also probably works better for taller people.","25-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","AA","Felt like Meghan Markle","The weather changed on me but would’ve wore if I could!","22-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","LeahFC","So Versatile!","I wore this SO much! It was the perfect transition piece for fall as it wasn't too heavy but was roomy enough to layer under. I ordered a size up which I usually do in coats but probably could have gone with my regular 1X. Love!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","tfmarron","Too Oversized but still Cute","This coat is pretty cute, but it really it is just too big. I ordered above my usual size because they didn’t have my size or even below it. Depending on the look you want and what you plan on wearing underneath this jacket, minimum size down 1 size. It legitimately looked like a robe on me, and honestly I wouldn’t have minded that much if it had been a belted coat. But because it wasn’t it just hung so funny. Cute good but it’s just not the best fit from what I gather!","8-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","katkat","Beautiful coat","Very elegant and high-end. Felt chic wearing this. It does wrinkle somewhat easily.","3-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","carns","Super large but modern jacket","It's pretty large on my frame but cozy and chic!","30-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","CrystalSticfigga","Thinner, More Lightweight Than Expected","It wasn’t cold enough to wear it, but it would look good worn over literally any outfit. This type of coat is a must-have staple item and the camel color goes with everything. I was a little surprised at the weight of the coat. It reminds me of a thicker, heavier felt material.","28-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Raykaygabe","Great quality coat!","This coat is more like a coat-like jacket and it’s falls effortlessly allowing it to really be a part of your overall look. Loved the quality! Unfortunately it was so warm in Philadelphia when I rented this that I was only able to wear it in the morning.","27-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","Framespring2013","So cute, will be renting again","Beautiful piece, one little complaint is that in the pictures it looks more stiff but in person it’s way softer. Has a different look.","16-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/camel-hair-robe-coat?color=016","elg802","Gorgeous Fall Coat","Love everything about this robe coat and got so many compliments on it. I'm an XS and found it to run on the large side but that's the style. High quality but could be a tad itchy at times. This coat goes with everything and would have gotten more wears if the weather was a bit cooler out!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","Msamieifyanasty","Garment was dirty","When I pulled this dress out of my shipment I noticed two large stains on it. I tried to launder it. I wash all of my nuuly garments by hand and then hang them to dry. Unfortunately the stains remain and I put it back in the case without trying on.","20-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","ShenAnniegans","Runs large","This dress was easy to slip on, the material nice, and I really appreciated the stripes. I would agree with other reviewers that the dress runs a bit large and made it a bit less flattering than I had hoped.","11-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","mollstothewall","Maxi on petites","This dress came to a maxi length on me (5’2” for reference). Got it for a vacation that was canceled and it was too lightweight for brisk spring weather. Would re-try in the summer!","30-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","Anniekay","Sunset dress","So cute and simple and flattering. The only thing I don’t love is that the slits are higher than I would prefer. The material is sort of a high quality heavy linen. The blue is super pretty. Rent it!","30-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","Joe","THE SUNSET DRESS","Although this dress was too big for me, the belt made it adjustable enough to wear. The fabric is thick, but the slit on the side allows a breeze. It does wrinkle fairly easily during travel and the fabric can't be steamed, it needs to be ironed. Overall, I highly recommend this dress for vaca! It goes with almost any occasion!","23-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","CSundo","The buttons will not stay closed","It is a beautiful dress to wear. However, the buttons are getting loose and will just undo themselves while walking or sitting. The dress fits great and looks great if I do not move.","2-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","Cathie","Lovely","Easy to throw on summer dress. I loved it. Perfect for barbecues, brunches and lunches. One PSA: Buttons opened a little too easily (I had to keep checking they were done up) but otherwise perfect.","4-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","mgbergie","Pretty, not for me","Really pretty dress, but the buttons on the front were placed in a way that gaped on my bust. I wasn't able to make it work unfortunately.","30-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","Swell","Cute but not forgiving","Was hoping to bring this dress on vacation but it ran small and had no stretch at all.","7-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","chill","Love this dress!","I wore this dress so many times when I had it! It fit well and was appropriate for many different occasions. The only issue I had with this dress is that the linen wrinkled very easily.","28-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","msdriscoll","Really flattering and perfect for any occasion","I really loved this dress. It was comfortable and cozy and flattering. Great for a summer break in Nantucket type of dress! Because of the material it wrinkles quite a bit so wearing it to the office and sitting at the desk all day wasn't awesome because by lunch it was all wrinkled from the waist down. It would be great for a party where you're doing a lot of casual conversation and walking around though!","19-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","Gaaaalina","Breathable linen dress great for hot summer days","Got lots of compliments every time I wore this! I wore it a few times on hot summer days, styled with a pair of flat sandals. The dress is great for low-key daytime activities or just relaxing in. One con: it wrinkles easily and is a bit hard to iron as it is a stiffer linen.","18-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","brithug00","well made gorgeous dress","even out of the box, this dress had my heart! i rented several dresses to wear to an event last week that was cancelled due to hurricane, however i was determined to wear this dress once! Nice thick linen, came right out of the box unwrinkled! (that would have been a deal breaker for me. The waist tie and cut of the top worked well for me but might be overwhelming for someone with a smaller bust. I had to order a larger size than i usually wear due to availability and it fit loosely but i would like to see how my regular size would look. Also i would note the photos makes this dress look midi length but it was almost a maxi on me and im quite tall. i would buy this if it goes down in price, i live in florida and would wear it all year! great quality, great style, classic!","10-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-sunset-dress?color=040","NatRick","Wish it worked","Thought this dress would be lovely but unfortunately it did not fit on me through the chest. I am a 34G and I could not get this to button over the chest despite ordering the XL. 3 stars because length is great and I think this would be lovely on, just would recommend being slightly smaller chested for your size.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-lil-dude-jeans?color=093","KKM","Great staple","These are a great staple to any closet... They were a great wash and very flattering. They were VERY stiff at first wear and took a few wears to get them to a comfy place but awesome jeans!","18-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-lil-dude-jeans?color=093","TKD","Relaxed Jean","Really like these jeans for a dressed down look. Best if you aren't going to be sitting for most of the day, they stretch out in the butt. Still love them and will wear accordingly","12-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-lil-dude-jeans?color=093","Marlee","So Small","The denim feels like great quality, but that's the only positive I can say. I sized up because of reviews, and still could not get them over my hips. They honestly just felt like they were 2 sizes smaller than what I ordered. There's absolutely no stretch/give.","29-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-lil-dude-jeans?color=093","mamar","Not made for mamas.","These were definitely not cute for women with curves. Or pear-shaped women. Fit my waist, could not get my thighs in the legs. So, if you have super skinny legs and a wider middle, these will be perfect. Those with a smaller waist and athletic thighs, not so much.","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-lil-dude-jeans?color=093","Tbrook","Weird proportions","I loved that these had structure to them, but they fit oddly. I have a big butt and average thighs - weirdly these felt fine in my butt yet the thighs were really tight.","13-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-lil-dude-jeans?color=093","Sierra","Not for curvy girls","I typically wear a 4/6 in pants. Many people said these run small so I ordered a size 30 to be safe. Let me tell you, I have never had a pair of pants fit so ill. The material was very thick with no give, which is fine, but then I would expect these to be tight all over. I have thick thighs and a booty with a smaller waist. These were uncomfortably tight on my thighs, but extremely shaggy in the crouch area with a way to large waist band. The way they fit my butt was even worse. They did not hug my at all. Hopefully I have a better experience with a different pair of AYR because I've really been wanting to try this brand. I'm sure these look great on some girls, but if you have thicker thighs, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.","18-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wrap-it-up-sweater?color=001","Maranda","Should have trusted the reviews","Like most other reviews mentioned, this sweater is an odd fit. The material is very heavy and feels like a sweatshirt. The ties are an awkward length and I had time trying to figure out how to tie them. The kicker for me were the sleeves though. Once I figured out how to tie the wrap, the sleeves were so long that they went down to the tips of my fingers and the shoulders were so boxy. It looked like two different shirts: the middle was wrapped nicely and fit, but the sleeves looked way too long and sloppy. Oh well, I guess that's the beauty of renting- you get to try something without any fear of being stuck with it if you hate it. This one will sadly go back unworn.","28-Feb-2020"

The eyelet fabric is sweet, but there's no lining, so you'll need a cami if you're bashful (I was fine with a nude bra and no cami).

I found myself skipping over all the jackets I own to wear this at any opportunity.

It is not intended to be form flattering, but it is a stunning dress and every time I wore it people stopped me to compliment me and ask where I got it. I wore with with high heeled sandals then when the temp dropped put it with high brown boots. Both looks were great. One thing I noticed was the weight of the dress caused the neckline to ride up in the front which meant it was cut low in the back, didn't bother me though. I loved it so much I will probably keep it.","18-Nov-2019"

I sized down and tried to belt it, but I feel that it made me look bigger because of all the fabric that doesn't really allow for much definition at the waist. The details and fabric are nice, but it really is one of the most large and shapeless things I've worn besides a snuggie.

I loved the way this dress looked but only wore it a couple times as the slip underneath rides up a bit and I had to keep going underneath the dress to pull it down since the dress is kinda sheer.

I’ve worn it several times to the beach, with boots on a colder day, and just chilling at home. Highly recommend. I’m usually a small and went down to XS because of the reviews. It’s obviously a loose fitting dress but I recommend going one size down.","19-Dec-2019"

It is not intended to be form flattering, but it is a stunning dress and every time I wore it people stopped me to compliment me and ask where I got it. I wore with with high heeled sandals then when the temp dropped put it with high brown boots. Both looks were great. One thing I noticed was the weight of the dress caused the neckline to ride up in the front which meant it was cut low in the back, didn't bother me though. I loved it so much I will probably keep it.","18-Nov-2019"

The slip underneath was very tight like an XS (when I probably needed a S instead), but the outer flowyness of the dress made me size down. Given my small frame I felt as though I was drowning in fabric at times, so I paired the dress with a jean jacket to help give it more shape.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I sized down and tried to belt it, but I feel that it made me look bigger because of all the fabric that doesn't really allow for much definition at the waist. The details and fabric are nice, but it really is one of the most large and shapeless things I've worn besides a snuggie.

Size down for sure I usually wear a small and ordered an XS and it fit great. The small would have been too big. I loved the way this dress looked but only wore it a couple times as the slip underneath rides up a bit and I had to keep going underneath the dress to pull it down since the dress is kinda sheer. Other than that I loved it and got so many compliments on it! I just wouldn’t wear it if you have a lot of walking around to do.","23-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hidden-valley-buttondown?color=011","lab4487","Very oversized","This item is definitely meant to be oversized - I wish I'd read the reviews a bit more thoroughly before adding to my order for the month. The product photos on the site are a bit of an underrepresentation of just how oversized this shirt is. The hem is incredibly long and with the material of the shirt being so thick it's difficult to tuck in without adding a lot of bulk. It's also very wide overall - shoulders, bust, waist, basically everywhere. I tried wearing it long with leggings, tucked in at the waist of high-waisted jeans, and tied in front. I feel like the sleeves are also a bit more ""balloon-like"" than the picture makes it seem. A lot of the other reviews suggest sizing down a size. I got a medium and almost think I could get away with an XS and normally my bust is a problem in button ups. Overall, I don't think this was a great selection.","7-Jan-2020"

I wore it with the sleeves rolled up with leggings at 6 months pregnant and had plenty of room.","9-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hidden-valley-buttondown?color=060","lab4487","Very oversized","This item is definitely meant to be oversized - I wish I'd read the reviews a bit more thoroughly before adding to my order for the month. The product photos on the site are a bit of an underrepresentation of just how oversized this shirt is. The hem is incredibly long and with the material of the shirt being so thick it's difficult to tuck in without adding a lot of bulk. It's also very wide overall - shoulders, bust, waist, basically everywhere. I tried wearing it long with leggings, tucked in at the waist of high-waisted jeans, and tied in front. I feel like the sleeves are also a bit more ""balloon-like"" than the picture makes it seem. A lot of the other reviews suggest sizing down a size. I got a medium and almost think I could get away with an XS and normally my bust is a problem in button ups. Overall, I don't think this was a great selection.","7-Jan-2020"

However, come Spring, I will be wearing it with a wine colored leather jacket I got from Nuuly as well and boots. Summertime-just throw on the dress and go! It works all year long and not every dress, especially those that are printed, will allow that. The fit was true to size for me (with Free People you honestly never know until you try it on in my opinion). Loved it!","9-Jan-2020"

I didn't mind the material, which is what most of the other reviewers disliked. However, the slip was really long and hung out of the bottom of the dress. The straps on the slip are adjustable, but honestly, if I made the slip shorter, then the dress would've been to short for me to feel comfortable wearing (and I'm used to wearing short dresses). The slip honestly seemed like it could've been an XL while the main part of the dress was true to size. Really wish this had worked.","17-Jan-2020"

We are in that time where it's a bit too cold to wear a topper like this on it's own, so it just didn't come up.

It is like a thick, almost suede-like material so much more of a heavy jacket than just something to toss on. I got it as a Summer to Fall transition piece and it was a little too thick to wear other than for a cool night. Also, I'm 5'9 and it went all the way to my knees!

If you have a booth, it would even show the panty line. Also beware, it is a very vibrant gold ... so you need a place where it’s appropriate to where bright gold.","17-Jan-2020"

Getting to try on new styles is what it's all about! I am so glad I took the chance on these, because they are absolutely beautiful. The color is gorgeous, and the fit itself is incredibly flattering. I'm pear-shaped, so I've always stayed away from wide legged pants in fear of my hips looking gigantic, but these drape so beautifully that it actually accentuated the best parts of my lower body. It took me a few tried to tie it into a fashionable knot because the straps are shorter than I would have liked, but once I got the hang of it, it looked very chic.

I wore these a few different ways - with casual cut off tee or nicer top for dinner with heels. The one issue I had was some fabric pilling And the waistband twisting.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sotheby-wide-leg-pants?color=070","JLRizzy","Heavy, glittery pants, not flattering","Well, I was surprised at how glittery the fabric of these pants is- somehow I missed that in the photos. The fabric is very heavy and they have long slits up the legs. Overall, they're OK but I wish they were more flattering in the tummy area. I'm generally a 10/12 in pants and I think I could've gone for the medium- maybe it would've held things in place in a more flattering way. Wore once, styled with a white button down similar to the model, but with the material being what it is, I could see these being dressed up or down. Just OK, wouldn't rent again.","27-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sotheby-wide-leg-pants?color=070","cviv","Nice weight, run big!","This pants are a nice, thick sweater knit in a fun color. The tie waist and slits add fun details. They do run a bit big so I had to wear them with my highest heels! I wanted them to sit at my high waist, but they were too big for that and I wasn't able to make it work even with the tie. Styled them with a fitted striped tee, navy linen blazer, and clogs for work.","25-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sotheby-wide-leg-pants?color=070","theannabelled","Comfy pants with a touch of class","Love the funky color for fall. Definitely runs big in the waist so size down. Pretty lightweight but a little long. Looks great dressed up or down!","21-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sotheby-wide-leg-pants?color=070","britt","LOVE these but showed wear easily","Loved these pants- perfect amount of drape, beautiful sheen to the fabric. The petite was perfect for me at 5'3"" with flats, but for heels I would have done the regular. These were super comfy and paired well with a graphic tee for a casual look, or a blouse to dress them up. Overall I loved them, with the caveat that they did pill very easily and got caught on anything I rubbed against.","9-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sotheby-wide-leg-pants?color=070","JodyP","Poor quality material great color and cut","The material of these feels nice and unique, but gets caught on everything and runs leaving trails of fluff. It runs as easily as cheap pantyhose. It got caught on a pencil, a binder, and a grocery basket. threads fluffed up and looked ridiculous for the rest of the day at work. Otherwise it was a great cut, and color. I had such high hopes when I got it.","2-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/astrid-needlepoint-mini-dress?color=009","AMAC934","Not for preggos","I added this dress to my Nuuly because the reviews implied that it was large and roomy in the bust. Sadly, it just fits (barely). I am 15 weeks pregnant with second baby and curvy to begin with. I could just squeeze into this and will definitely only be wearing once. I would suggest sizing up or skipping all together if you're pregnant or really busty in general.","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/astrid-needlepoint-mini-dress?color=009","Shawnethegirl","Not as flattering for hourglass figures as I expected","It’s a shame, because I super loved the pattern on it! The colors were also perfect. Hoped that I could enjoy wearing this during the daytime, but the bust was awkward. The built in lining is sewed in at the waist, leaving it challenging to line up the top half in the most flattering way. I found myself constantly adjusting it throughout the day and feeling uncomfortable overall. If you are curvier or bustier, it’s going to end up feeling fussier","22-Feb-2020"

I made it work with a different belt, and actually liked the longer length of dress(usually these types of dresses are short on me). The bust area was gapingly larger, and the waist is stretchy, so there was just too much fabric losing a lot of the shape. Colors are beautiful!","8-Oct-2019"
