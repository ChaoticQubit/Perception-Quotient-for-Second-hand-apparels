If you like your jeans shorts to sit lower on your hips, your usual size will work! If you like a higher-waisted fit, I suggest sizing down. Length is super short which is what this designer is known for so be prepared for lots of leg!","20-Apr-2020"

I folded the sleeves a few inches to allow my hands to come through the openings.

It had so much potential with some structure and cute design, but the fit was too loose. That being said I still made it work and wore it out to a nice dinner with jeans and heels, and then again working from home and running around town with clogs or flats. As a belled sleeve lover, good intro into this look. I recommend sizing down! Perhaps two sizes down if you don't have a big bust/arms.","24-Mar-2020"

Instantly regretted. Unflattering pattern and really just a bad color scheme going on. I really really wanted it to work and I was going to copy the light wash jean look the model in the picture is wearing but it just was not happening and my roommates agreed (I tried walking out the door with it on.) Also fit really huge everywhere.","22-Mar-2020"

I ordered the large based off of that sizing, however I'm not sure if there is just too much fabric up top, or if I needed to size down. I feel as though the waist was a good fit, but my boobs (which are kinda large) did NOT exist in this top. It was so strange! If you're between two sizes, order the smaller size and hopefully you'll have a better experience with this could-be-should-be beautiful top. Haven't worn it and won't :/","12-Mar-2020"

The fabric is light weight and it looks expensive on. It dresses up a pair of joggers without loosing comfort. it's very versatile - I've worn it for Zoom work calls and when I wanna look dressed up for the day while still being cozy. It does run a little big - I'm going to try it in L next month and keep whichever fits better.","20-May-2020"

The stitching (front seam goes from the bottom of the buttons all the way down through the crotch) is quite unflattering unless you are rail thin and very tall - I'm not. The legs are way long. Ultimately I wouldn't leave the house in this, but it's wildly comfortable for lounging around in if you don't care that you look like you're wearing an oversized baby jumper. I'm not even confident the xs would have sufficed here.","16-May-2020"

But the straps, torso and length were all SO long on me, it looked silly and didn’t fit well at all. I’m 5’4” with a short waist. Would recommend for those at least a few inches taller, or with a long torso.","13-May-2020"

It's gathered to nip in the waist but didn't feel tight at all. Since it doesn't have any stretch and is cut a little narrow in the hips, I'd suggest sizing up if you have fuller hips. The armholes are a little low so there was a tiny peek of my bra when I lifted my arms - easily fixed with a cami or bandeau underneath!","19-Apr-2020"

It’s really soft and comfortable but cute and unlike anything I’ve ever really seen outside of the Midsommar costumes (speaking of which it would be perfect for a cult member Halloween costume).

But even sizing up I couldn’t even get this over my butt end they were HUGGING my thighs in such an unflattering way. I was so depressed it was really a confidence lowering experience to say the least. If you’re curvy - these aren’t for you, and I’m in that boat. Bummed out.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cassina-tiered-midi?color=034","ChezSimone","So Comfy, Vibrant Color","The favorite of this month's nuuly. Wore it at home, wore it to social distancing with family, wore whenever I could. So comfy, so vibrant. I've been gravitating towards brightly colored clothes to lift my mood during Oregon's stay at home order. This dress makes it easy. It's flowy, a little textured with the tiering, made of quality fabric, and bright neon green but with a little fading, which makes it's color a little less overpowering. As for fit, it's pretty true to size but runs small in the chest. I wore at home without a bra and in public with a supportive swim top and a small was just a teensy bit tight.","13-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cassina-tiered-midi?color=034","clairefraser","Super Cute but beware of fit!","This dress was so cute! The color was everything and I was so exited to wear it, but be aware the top part runs tight in the arms shoulder and chest area!","8-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brush-stroke-crop-top?color=010","nuudie","Cropped and Cute!","very cropped in a good way! Love the keyhole detail. Sleeves are a good length. There is probably good support if you have a larger chest. Fabric is a bit crunchy but it works for this style top","21-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brush-stroke-crop-top?color=010","cdillydally","True to size, fitted with no stretch","Fit perfectly in a size Small. The fabric doesn't have any stretch so if you're usually between sizes, I suggest sizing up to avoid it being too tight! Zips on one side from under the arm to the hem","20-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weston-floral-blazer?color=015","Sjarek68","Way oversized by 3 sizes","This blazer would be beautiful but the sizing is way off. I put this on and it went down to my knees and the arms were about 4 inches past my hands. Literally, it was as though I had been sent the wrong size as there’s no way this could be accurate sizing.","8-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/weston-floral-blazer?color=015","cdillydally","Cut for an oversized fit, sleeves are long","This blazer is cut for an oversized fit so it's big all around and the sleeves are extra long. It has a single button at the front to use as a closure but I belted it to mix it up! If you are on the more petite side, you can cuff or push up the sleeves so they don't extend past your hands","20-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/isha-sweater?color=011","AthenSpec","Perfect-fit, spring strawberry top","Wore it with the green jeans from Nuuly. It's a soft, fitted sweater that's not-too-heavy for the current spring-like, transitional weather. I loved wearing it, but couldn't justify keeping it with the price tag (~$200-300), knowing it might only receive 1-2 more wearings.","12-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/atonement-button-up-maxi?color=070","nuudie","So beautiful but So long!","I wanted this to work but it's very very long. Would not recommend for petites. The bust area is also large and very low. Overall, just meant for someone at least 5'5""","21-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/atonement-button-up-maxi?color=070","cdillydally","True to size","This dress is STUNNING! It runs true to size with an attached tie at the waist so you can cinch in as tight as you like. I'm tall and this dress was midi in the front and ankle-length in the back on me so if you're petite you'll definitely need some heels to avoid the back dragging. It buttons down the front and doesn't have any stretch so if it's too snug the buttons may gap apart a little.","20-Apr-2020"
