"https://www.nuuly.com/products/houndstooth-turtleneck?color=009","themrsnaylor","Thick but itchy","I loved this sweater. I got it bc it looked thick and warm. It is perfect for colder Texas days and I can wear this without a jacket. Two things I didn’t love were: 1. It was much shorter than it looked on the model. More like to my belt on my mid wasted jeans. 2. It was pretty scratchy material. I’ll wear it again maybe with a very light undershirt.","21-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/houndstooth-turtleneck?color=009","tenillen","Great for Holiday","Loved this shirt but was very thick. Not for warm weather climate. I typically wear a M/L but I wanted this a little more fitted. Ordering the small was a perfect fit. I wore with jeans but could have been styled with a leather skirt.

The only thing I would note is the fabric portion that is not suede wrinkles easily. I packed it for vacation and was thankful the warm climate took most of the wrinkles from travel out!","1-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gulliver-draped-jacket?color=112","sallysimply","Great open jacket","This jacket has a lot of pros: the pockets, the neutral color, the draped style. It looks good with a lot of things and it kept me warmer than I expected! One major con is that it's fairly low in the back, so it sometimes looked weird depending on the top I was wearing. It also sucks that it doesn't have a zipper. Of course, you don't always need a zipper, but something about this style kept making me wish it had one.","28-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gulliver-draped-jacket?color=112","kelleybdeal","Not really how the photo looks","This is a linen blend and was verrry wrinkled when I got it. I ironed it, but it got super wrinkly during the day - it's not quite as cozy as it looks, and ends up kind of feeling like a wrinkly jacket. Not my favorite - just ended up feeling kind of 'dumpy' throughout the day (sorry I'm having trouble finding the right words!).","20-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gulliver-draped-jacket?color=112","Yilsa","Light jacket","I used this as my travel jacket on my vacation. I love the suede on the shoulders. I with the rest of the material had more structure. But overall good jacket","10-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gulliver-draped-jacket?color=112","amayzing62704","Wasn't impressed","I was so excited to get this jacket because I had actually been tracking it online. However, when I pulled it out of the shipping box it just looked so wrinkled and the fabric was just completely different than I anticipated. It just looked a little cheap to me. It probably would have been fine if I had taken the time to give it a good steam, but ultimately I never ended up wearing this jacket.","24-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gulliver-draped-jacket?color=112","foodiemama","Versatile and light weight","This is a great light-weight jacket. Note that it does feel like linen, and wrinkles accordingly, so if that bothers you then you may not like it. I usually wear a petite (5'3""), but got the regular size, and am glad I did. The regular hit well above my hip, so I feel that the petite would have been too short.","1-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/summer-orchard-skirt?color=089","Calliope","Liked it so much I bought it","I wore this like 8 times during my subscription month and got a ton of compliments on it every time. I don't usually wear bold patterns but felt comfortable in this one. It is double layered, the fabric is nice, is well constructed. I am petite and long skirts often make me look short but this one was well proportioned on me. It looks nice even if it gets a bit wrinkled (I packed it for a trip). I wore it to a casual picnic in the park and a nice dinner, it's versatile.","5-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/summer-orchard-skirt?color=089","RainbowGlitter","Pretty color","I wore this with a tight black top and belt. The color really stood out and I loved the pockets.

The waist sits really nicely and creates a pretty silhouette while also being super comfy for all day wear. Was 100% true to size for me and a good length (I'm 5'7"").

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/high-rise-railroad-striped-jeans?color=049","Charasann","Not for me","Love the look of these pants but looked terrible on me. Not sure why because I feel like they are meant for petites but the overall fit just wasn’t right for me and didn’t look anything like they do on the model. I don’t think they were too small but the stripes looked odd and seemed to bend in all directions making them very unflattering. Buttons also pulled apart as if they were being stretched but they were loose in the waist and hips so maybe they just weren’t sewn in properly, I don’t know. Cute pants regardless","18-Mar-2020"

I rented these in a 32 and they were really big -- a waist gap and a lot space in the hips (and I actually have hips). I could have sized down to a 30 here -- I think they would have been flattering if I had. The material is almost like a chambray, loose and easy and nice for August heat.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It's really pretty and fun, the top part fits like a glove, I didn't even have to re-tie the halter portion. The bottom half is OK, there is quite a bit of fabric at the bottom and the picture of the model is accurate where the front portion almost folds in the middle-front to look like a jumpsuit. I didn't notice this before ordering so when I tried it on I was a little disheartened because extra fabric on the bottom of anything doesn't really flatter my figure, but I think I could make this work once or twice in the month that I have it.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

Things to know that might not being apparent: This dress is made of jersey fabric, so it's like a thick partially stretch t-shirt fabric. Because of that i's very forgiving. It also has a lining. which gives it more movement, body, and a nice weight. However, because it's jersey, it has the power to fade... and my dress looked pretty worn. It was more dark grey than black, but it's a testament to the dress that it was still comfy and gorgeous. Also there is boning on the sides of the torso. The boning gives the dress just a bit of structure where it's needed most, and it contributes to the retro vibe of the dress.","14-May-2020"

Love the embroidery and the back is so beautiful. I wore this to work, out, everywhere and anywhere I could. I was able to go down to a size 4, which fit my top perfectly. Given that there's more room in the hips, the size 4 is perfect. I typically wear a size 28/6 in bottoms, but in flare dresses, I can get away with a 4.

I think the straps were not an issue of being too loose, as the boob situation countered the long crisscross back.

On my short, curvy frame the dress alone looked like a vintage Renaissance fair gown. I had to add a belt, a lightweight cardi & simple jewelry to tone down the wench-y look. It was not a look I could manage to make office appropriate. I also had a hard time keeping all the little hook & eye fasteners closed at my bust.

I do have larger upper-arms and there is no stretch to the sleeve at all, so I could not wear this.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/donna-floral-midi-dress?color=015","AlexAlex","Cute but a bit off","In person, this dress just doesn't have the same feeling as the photo. I know that's vague but it feels a bit more muted and matronly in person. The fabric is super thick in person and kind of just hung on me in a way that didn't have the flow-y, billowy vibe I thought it would. It didn't fit well to my waist so I felt like it did nothing for my body. The shoulders were kind of tight too, which was odd since it was still so loose on the waist, I wouldn't want to size down for that reason. I see photos on here of other people and they look super cute in it! It was just a miss for me with my fair coloring I felt pretty washed out, the proportions weren't quite right for my body, and the fabric was really thick.","26-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/oahu-dress?color=015","Juliette_Alexandra","Obsessed!!","This dress was one I was already excited about, but then when I put it on it was absolute perfection! I have a curvy shape, with broad shoulders/large rib cage, flat chest, and then wide hips and a lot of booty--- this makes it hard to find things that are stand-out flattering. This dress was like magic. The cut and placement of the pockets finally allows me to wear a dress with pockets that doesn't make my wide hips even wider (usually dresses with pockets make me look like i'm wearing saddle bags). The top gives me a lovely shape on my chest that gives the look of a little more than I've actually got, and the way the waist cuts in is super flattering. For the winter I've been wearing it with a long grey sweater, but I am so excited to wear it year round. And best part is-- the fabric looks so nice but feels like pajamas! Can't stop raving about it-- you guys have to try it!","24-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/oahu-dress?color=001","Juliette_Alexandra","Obsessed!!","This dress was one I was already excited about, but then when I put it on it was absolute perfection! I have a curvy shape, with broad shoulders/large rib cage, flat chest, and then wide hips and a lot of booty--- this makes it hard to find things that are stand-out flattering. This dress was like magic. The cut and placement of the pockets finally allows me to wear a dress with pockets that doesn't make my wide hips even wider (usually dresses with pockets make me look like i'm wearing saddle bags). The top gives me a lovely shape on my chest that gives the look of a little more than I've actually got, and the way the waist cuts in is super flattering. For the winter I've been wearing it with a long grey sweater, but I am so excited to wear it year round. And best part is-- the fabric looks so nice but feels like pajamas! Can't stop raving about it-- you guys have to try it!","24-Nov-2019"

(If you were considering wearing it with a nude bra or bandeau, know that it will show and not just at the sides: It cuts in more than you might think at the front.

However, it's hard to wear since any bra shows through it due to the way the arms are cut and the open sides. The arm holes are cut much lower than shown on the model. It would probably be better worn with nude pasties, but I never had the time to go get some to try it out. Since I feel uncomfortable when my bra shows, I never wore it out. It is very cute though!","6-Sep-2019"

I tried making it more fitted by adding a belt but it was still slightly too big around my thighs and butt.

Very comfortable regardless and I did receive a couple compliments for the style.","12-Oct-2019"

It's extremely light weight and comfortable. My only complaint (and reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the bust is pretty large. I have a pretty small bust size (32A) so it will probably would work perfectly on an average-sized bust.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lana-tie-dye-bias-midi?color=055","cdillydally","Silky, flattering, and so pretty!","I wore this skirt to work with a blush tee and got so many compliments! Since it's bias cut, the sizing if flexible. I got a 4 to fit my waist and it fit my hips perfectly too (I'm usually a 6 on bottom). It's incredibly silky and the fabric is substantial enough that it's not see-through like some other slip skirts I've tried. Could easily throw this on with a silk top and heels to dress it up, or with a sweatshirt for the weekend -- it's surprisingly versatile! It was a little wrinkled when it arrived but I hung it up for a few days before wearing and all the creases were gone.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/trey-jumpsuit?color=092","rachelaa","Almost worked","I love the idea. Material was super comfy - thick and stretchy. It fit well lengthwise in the torso, but way too long for my average length legs. And there was no way to really roll them up due to them being looser at the bottom. I also felt like the waist was maybe stretched out on the one I got because it was way loose on me in the center, yielding more of a mechanic than sexy jumpsuit vibe.","17-Jan-2020"

Because it's freezing in NYC, I was able to wear ankle stockings underneath it and stayed really warm. That probably worked for the best anyway - its tight enough to show underwear lines.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/trey-jumpsuit?color=092","Alinphilly","Stretchy denim, but not flattering if you have a tummy","This jumpsuit is made of stretchy denim, so it fit me, however I am more straight-waisted and it wasn't super flattering on my mid section since it has an elastic waist. I ended up styling it un-zipped to the waist, with a graphic tank underneath, which then allowed it to not pull as tight thought the middle. If you have more of an hourglass shape, I would think this would fit a lot better. As for length, I'm 5'7"" and can wear this with chunky 2"" heels. They were a little long to just wear with flats unless you're ok with them bunching a bit at the ankle.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

And it could have been that they were a tad snug, but the well-made fabric that was meant to cover the thick shiny silver silver at the side laid agape when zipped, which made it look a little “mall” / cheapy. Certainly cute, though!","8-Jan-2020"

I don't like the showing ANY type of bra strap and did not have room in the fitted torso area for full length tank/top.

It is definitely for tall girls -- I am 5'9"" and had to wear 3"" high clogs with it to keep the pants off the ground. However, the long legs definitely made it more flattering. I felt it stretch out a bit throughout the day (especially in the waist/hips) and I'm curious how the fit might change if it went through the wash and shrank a bit.

They are so flattering, comfortable, and perfect shape. I sized up, per other reviews and they fit well. They do stretch a tad bit, so if you like them snug your regular size might fit too. The hem on mine was a lot more raw than shown in the photos, but I actually really liked it. It gave them a super casual feel. They hit just above my ankle bone for that almost cropped, but not too cropped look. 10/10 would recommend!","27-Feb-2020"

I think it's a piece that would be sold in an Urban Outfitters, and I feel like everything that comes from UO runs a little smaller than FP or Anthro, so you kind of have to keep that in mine. The only thing I would say about this shirt is that there's a weird lining on the inside of the button down area and if you unbutton the top buttons for going out, the weird lining kind of gets in the way. It's still a really cute shirt nonetheless.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The puffed sleeves and mini peplum details gave the soft, feminine touch my outfit needed. I personally couldn't get the sleeves to stay on my shoulders, but I loved the look of the top off-the-shoulders so that was fine by me. The hanger strings kept popping out because of that though and that was slightly annoying. If you're looking for a top to emphasize your bustline, this is the top for you because of the zigzag stitching pattern (excellent for when you are trying to avoid wearing a bra too lol).

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/picot-picnic-blouse?color=040","kgmf_500","Beautiful but can be revealing","Loved this top! Fit like a tee! I wore it everywhere - to work, to book club, and on date night. Super versatile and easy to wear. I paired mine with jeans / jean shorts. As for size, I'm small chested and I could wear it on it's own without cleavage showing. However, for larger chested women, some may be more comfortable with a cami underneath - it can be pretty exposing depending on how you tie it since it is a wrap shirt.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/picot-picnic-blouse?color=040","Rachel","Beautiful top with great color!","I loved this shirt and plan on still getting a few more wears from it throughout the month. I wore it out for a dinner out on the town over some skinny jeans. I loved the vibrant blue color. I thought it ran a bit large, but if you are large-breasted, this may not be an issue. Be mindful that the way this top goes on is by way of a tie / wrap, so if that's not your thing then you may not enjoy it. I loved the way it sat on my waist and accentuated feminine features!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ribbed-knit-camisole?color=025","SaraMat","Perfect Black Tank","I ended up purchasing this tank - it's the right black tank to wear alone, under a sweater/jacket, whatever! The ribbed texture makes it look better than a basic cotton tank. It does run larger/stretch, so if you're worried about it being too tight, it won't be if you're ordering your normal size. I hate when tanks hug my tummy and this one definitely doesn't, but it's fitted at the bottom and not flowy which is great.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/desmond-tunic?color=011","Haleyb0p","Cute and comfy","This top is cute and comfortable. A luxe layer to throw on under a top. There are two main drawbacks to this piece, which prevented me from wearing it more - 1. The arm holes are pretty low cut, making this inappropriate for work unless you wear a blazer or cardigan over it. 2. The tunic length makes it hard to pair with an over layer unless that layer is a tunic length as well.","26-Aug-2019"
