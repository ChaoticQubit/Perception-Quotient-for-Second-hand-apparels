I'm tall with a long torso so it's hard to wear jumpers/bibs/etc. These fit great and the straps are adjustable. The rise was flattering but I do wish they were longer in length.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hepburn-overalls?color=091","Bean","Cuter in theory than reality","All of my jeans are size 26, but these were extremely tight in that same size so I would say they run small. However, I'm taller than average with a very long torso, and even then with the straps shortened as much as possible, they were too long and had to keep being readjusted. I could only wear these twice for a couple of hours because they were not comfortable. I did get lots of compliments and I'm glad I tried them because they're unique, but I should have listened to the reviews about the awkward fit.","31-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hepburn-overalls?color=091","Okland","surprisingly versatile overalls","Okay if I had sized up I think I actually would have worn these multiple times! I ended up criss crossing the straps in the back because I have a short torso and the straps stayed up really well like that! I just had a major camel toe because they were a little too tight for me!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hepburn-overalls?color=091","Leinewbeautystandard","A hassle","It was cute on, but the zipper was impossible for me to zip without assistance. It wasn't snug, just the placement was extremely hard to reach, but highly visible if left unzipped. Also the straps were too long for me, being 5'. Would be great for those with muscular thighs and at least 5'4"" . when I asked for measurements, they had someone measure at the FC, so that was nice. Overall, I was just too short for it.","23-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hepburn-overalls?color=091","CmConnelly","Frustrating zipper","Okay I love the style of these overalls. I love the hidden buttons on the straps. The length was good with my height. However the zipper was the bane of my clothing existence. It is a side zip but it doesn't have a button to help hold it together. Which is annoying. It also gets stuck on the thickest part of the jean and won't budge past that bunch of fabric. It fit. Was comfortable on. I just could not get that d*** zipper past that last inch of thick waistband.","11-Dec-2019"

It is very versatile, as you can dress it up or down. I love the detail on the sleeves, they kind of puff at the top and then are tighter on your forearm/wrist. Definitely more of a crop sweater, so I would recommend wearing with high-waist skirts/pants.","3-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hepburn-overalls?color=091","OverAlls","Tough to fit!","I really wanted to love these overalls, but I think they're just really hard to fit. I found the pants themselves to run a little large, and the straps kept sliding off even when they were on the tightest setting. The zipper didn't zip all the way up on mine, so that was a bummer. I have a pretty big butt, so there was significant gapping at the waist. Wanted to love, but wasn't easy to fit!","25-Nov-2019"

It takes awhile to get the right fit with the adjustable buttons on the straps and the side zip, and then the legs flare some and the suspenders have those ruffles. Certainly quite a statement and probably not something I would buy. Sort of a heavy look overall.","9-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hepburn-overalls?color=091","kstew","Fun details","I loved the straps on these overalls but like almost all overalls out there, they are too long. This problem is easily fixed by knotting the straps at a certain point in the back then choosing what length the button should go in. The waist was a little bit too big for me but am a true 25 in brands like Mother and rag and bone but more of a 24 in Pilcro.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/faux-suede-leggings?color=026","millennialpink","So cute, with a fatal flaw","Loved the feel of these leggings - they’re warm, cozy, and suede-like.

They were just a little too small to wear out comfortably. I have big hips and that was the main area it didn't fit.

They are perfect for fall and look good with sweats, cardigans, long flowy tops, etc. I ended up buying them at the anthro store since they weren’t discounted on nuuly - wanted a fresh pair. They are a little cropped in the legs like pictured and run true to size. They were so comfortable, there wasn’t really anything not to love about them. I wish they ran high wasted instead but it’s okay! Overall got a ton of compliments on them!!","4-Nov-2019"

I am not exaggerating when I say I wore it probably half of the days I had it - sometimes three or four days in a row. Post-holidays wintertime in Minnesota (where I live) gets really grey and dreary and this mustard color was a bright pop outside of my normal comfort area (black, black and more black). I primarily styled it like the model shot with a rotation of tees and tucked into jeans - so easy to execute yet made me look and feel so put together. I am hoping to rent it again on my next nuuly and am seriously considering buying it. I know several reviews said it ran large - yes, it is oversized but in the best possible way. I'm on the taller side (nearing 5'10"") so I get that on a more petite frame you may want to size down but for my fellow tall gals, I can't recommend this sweater enough!","13-Mar-2020"

The back is open and the shoulders have cut outs. Really soft material and stretchy. True to size and a fun piece.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/seine-sail-blouse?color=070","carlijeen","A+++","This shirt fits perfect and is just a beautiful pattern. I’m not a pattern person so getting this is felt like it was a coin toss... but it totally won me over. It’s kinda hard to wear a normal bra with it cause the straps show through the cut out shoulder slits... but totally worth it. Would be perfect with a strapless bra but I hate those. Highly suggest getting! Was great for work and wore it straight to dinner after.","13-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/seine-sail-blouse?color=070","jlr87","Watch for the cutouts","Cute, properly sized, but just didn't notice in all the photos that it has cutouts in the back and shoulders, so not wearable for work as I'd intended. This is more of a date night / night out top. :) Just FYI.","13-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/seine-sail-blouse?color=070","mamatuck","Seine Sail Blouse","I was not expecting the shoulders to be cut out. I didn't see that in the picture. The blouse was really pretty but I am tall, 5'11"" so it kept riding up on my waist due to the gathering around the bottom. Probably a better fit for someone with a shorter waist than me.","12-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/seine-sail-blouse?color=070","cait","Cold shoulders + open back","This is a much more revealing top than the photos suggest! I expected a conservative work-appropriate blouse, but the cold shoulders (covered by the model's hair in all but one photo) and open back (not visible in the photos) prevented it from being a work staple. I wore it once with high-waisted jeans and a faux fur coat to watch UFC instead.","22-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/seine-sail-blouse?color=070","Zpolynice","Didn’t wear","Did not like the fabric - felt and looked cheap in real life. The bunched “look” at the bottom made it difficult to tuck in and I didn’t want it showing my midriff showing - an odd length. Also, the back has a slit that can be pretty open so couldn’t wear it to work. Didn’t end up wearing it at all.","22-Oct-2019"

I really wanted this to fit, but it just didn't work on me. It made me look like I was wearing a pink, sequined paper bag. A bit more of a waistline or peplum-styling could have helped, but the straight up-and-down cut, in addition to the high neck and humongous sleeves, just engulfed me. This top could work really well for women with smaller hips or skinner legs to offset the considerable bulk of the top. But if you are pear shaped, it makes your torso / top seem huge, adds weight, and is not flattering.","9-Dec-2019"

The fit of the shirt was true to size, and great around the bust. The shoulders were a little on the snug side but I'm sure had I gone up a size the lower half of the shirt would not have fit right.

Perfect dress for when it’s warm out and you want something easy to throw on and and comfortable! Loved that it was longer so when the wind blew, I didn’t have to worry about the dress flying up.

I wore this with a denim jacket and Doc Martens on a cool day, sandals and a wide brim hat on a warm day.

It's casual but can still be dressed up to where it's really cute. Great for travel too! The only downside is you have to unbutton all the buttons every time you go to the bathroom. I'm usually between and XS and a S, typically a S. The XS fit great; a little big just like I would want a jumpsuit like this to fit!","5-Dec-2019"

It's nice and loose, so I think it would be a flattering fit on anyone. It is good for shorter girls, too, because of the cropped leg. I wore it to Universal and it was the perfect outfit to run around all day in. Would definitely rent again for a future vacation!","27-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tami-jumpsuit?color=001","SaraMat","Size down but worth it","I hate when jumpsuits are too tight on my torso and this one definitely wasn't. I'd suggest sizing down - I usually wear a M in jumpsuits and could have gone with a XS. The buttons definitely make it a little more casual, but you can dress it up with heels. Looks best with wedges as the length is a little strange (I'm 5'5"" and it seemed to be shorter on me than on the model). It was easy to get on, easy enough to take off to go to the bathroom, and very comfy so I'd highly recommend.","25-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tami-jumpsuit?color=001","Martha","Very Drapey & Low Cut","I liked the idea of this jumpsuit but the buttons were too heavy for the fabric and made the front droop down. This made my chest VERY exposed and I couldn’t wear it.","24-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tami-jumpsuit?color=001","Kbell","Very Cute & Versatile","This was a very cute jumpsuit and served me well this month. I dressed it down for casual day wear and up a bit for an engagement party. Be warned that it is a bit looser in the top and a bit more fitted in the bottom. I am very pear shaped, so that also likely factored in. The waist is fairly loose, so it probably won't stay secure where you put it if you tend to pull waists up a bit like I do.","21-Nov-2019"

It was a smidge tight around the hips, and oddly really loose in the top part. The buttons are oversized and heavy, while the fabric of the jumpsuit is lightweight, so they almost make the front panel top-heavy because of their weight. Not to mention the whole top is so oversized and baggy. I was hoping this one would be a win, but I didn't end up wearing.","27-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tami-jumpsuit?color=001","Ccarroll","Super comfy","If you need a comfy, casual go-to jumpsuit, this one is for you. It's a little on the slouchy side. The buttons are heavy, so it really pulls the jumpsuit down, adding extra fabric to the crotch area. I ended up pulling the waist area up more towards above my belly button area so that I didn't look like I was wearing a diaper. Because I am short, it seemed like there were one too many buttons for me, so this might work better on someone taller. Overall, super comfortable, light weight. Felt like pjs!","25-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tami-jumpsuit?color=001","NatalieH","Huge on top, but great otherwise!","The first thing to mention is that the bust of this jumpsuit is huge. I had to use a paperclip to pull back about 5 inches. Once I did that though, I loved it. It was so comfortable and could be paired with either flats or heels. The buttons really make the jumpsuit -- they're so fun and clunky, but be warned they can be difficult to button at times.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tami-jumpsuit?color=001","peachyallie","So comfortable and easy","I absolutely loved wearing this jumpsuit! The gauzy material feels thin, but is not translucent the way that some materials can be. The cropped length was perfect for me as a short-average statured person. The v-neck was a little low for me at work--work clothes being primarily how I use Nuuly--but with some double-sided tape and a prayer, I felt comfortable even on a day going in and out of the office frequently.","8-Oct-2019"

I wanted it so bad I went with an XLP. The waist was oddly long and poofed up at my hips. I threw on a denim jacket and wore anyway. It looked super cute with my jacket. I could not have pulled this off without it though. I wonder if the non-petite would have differed?","18-Oct-2019"

I will say I was surprised it’s fully lined with a layer of cotton jersey and the material itself is the heavier side.

I wore this to a work dinner event and received so many compliments I was honestly shocked. Then I wore it with sneakers to just run errands and again, a bunch of compliments. Finally, wore it on Christmas day with some Chelsea Boots and was not only dressed nicely, but comfortable! It's really the perfect day to evening dress and for anyone who isn't big on dresses, it's just the right amount of cool and can easily be made as girly or not girly as you want. It is lined, and slightly thicker fabric, but it didn't bother me in the extreme humidity of south Florida in December either. I wouldn't wear it in summer though.","7-Jan-2020"

It's a great mixture of causal and dressy. I am pretty tall and I would say the slit comes up to about knee length, the hem is just past mid-calf when I'm standing. The fabric is thick, but has a little stretch to it. I'm pear shaped, a size 8 up top and a size 12 bottom, the Large was a perfect fit. Styled it with a boyfriend length blazer for work, I liked the tie belt and I can't wait to switch it out the next time I wear it. I'm sure this would also be comfortable with tights underneath.

I ordered an XL and it fit me really well both in my torso and with it's length (I'm 5'5 and normally wear a size 12-14 in dresses depending on the style.) My only complaint, and the chief reason for me not purchasing, is that the sleeves have a folded look at the bottom, but the white lining wouldn't stay folded under, so it looked like the dress had an awkward white cuff on both sleeves, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.","9-Dec-2019"

The silhouette and fabric make it a great for transitional weather – I wore during the fall styled with over-the-knee boots, but I think it'd look great with sandals or booties in warmer weather. The neckline was an inch or so too low for me, but nothing a well-placed safety pin couldn't fix.","11-Dec-2019"

I planned to wear it to work, and it showed more leg than I thought Office appropriate. I did wear tights which helped! It wasn’t hoochie short, just not quite professional. Otherwise sizing was good! I’m a solid small, But I ordered an xs thinking this might be baggier in style, and I was right! Fit well, flattering, cute empire waist style. Would totally buy if it were on sale and not a petite.","3-Dec-2019"

It drapes beautifully- it’s just a touch longer in the back and it hangs in such a way that it is comfortable and roomy but doesn’t look like you’re wearing a bag.

It was so comfortable, did not wrinkle too bad while wearing and was the perfect length for the office. I was 23-26 weeks pregnant when I wore this dress and after reading reviews on both Nuuly and Anthropologie I ordered my pre-pregnancy size XS. Pre-pregnancy I am 5'4 105 pounds and currently I am closer to 130. I think the XS would have been a little hangy on me pre-pregnancy, but I still would wear it. Just know that it is loose-fitting at the waist. Very flattering for all shapes.","16-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dolman-quilted-knit-jacket?color=086","carolinedefelice","This jacket rocks and should be rented depending on what you will wear it with","This jacket is one of Free People's top sellers for a reason: it's freakin' amazing quality, perfect slouchiness for comfort, but still holds up in the cool department. So here's the thing with this jacket: If you wear the chunkiest sweaters on earth, you should still get a size smaller than you would usually get. If you want to wear this jacket so it's a bit more form-fitting, get 2 sizes smaller than you'd usually get. It's that slouchy! In the end just know it's supposed to look bigger, because that's how I think it's intended to be styled.","4-Oct-2019"

Otherwise, they were great pants and I could see myself wearing them a lot - I just would need to size down. Even when I had the waist strings pulled tight enough to keep the pants up, the top part of the pants was gappy and unflattering.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fly-away-parachute-pants?color=236","SurLaMer","Lots of Likes","These were great, very comfy, but just a tad too tight in the waist and it made them too short. I wore these twice, both times with the legs uncinched, since when they were gathered they just looked wonky hitting me at mid calf. They worked well both dressed up and down. The quality was good, but I really wish the 12 had been a little bigger in the waist. The length would probably would work on someone my height who has a smaller waist so that the pants would sit lower. I’m just a little too chubby to really rock these right now. But I did get lots of compliments!","5-Mar-2020"

Probably could have worn a 4 and might try them in my next Nuuly. Would consider buying if they dropped in price! These are awesome travel pants ... comfy but still chic!","28-Feb-2020"

These parachute pants definitely fall under that category. I have big hips, so baggy pants usually make me look awful, but these pants drew me in. They are so much cuter on and surprisingly comfortable. I can where anywhere between a size 8 to a size 12 (in higher end clothing) and the 10 fit perfectly, though a little snug after a meal because it’s high wasted and doesn’t have stretch.","26-Dec-2019"

Avoid renting if you have a longer torso or bigger hips or tummy. It ran small. I also have a full-body- so zipping it wasn't happening. I've gained some weight, so it's not so friendly to my shapely new size. If you have a long torso and have had problems with rompers in the past being too shoer in length, it might not be great either. BUT, this would be great for someone who is smaller and doesn't have problem areas in their waist. The fabric is luxe and silky. I really wanted it to work","26-Sep-2019"

This dress is nicer than my average Sunday dress, but it's still ""me"", so no one was surprised to see me wearing this style. My husband did say ""it looks like my mom made it"", referring to his mother's quilting hobby... But husbands don't know anything. The wrap was very easy to do, with a thick strip of the same material as the dress for wrapping it. It is a true wrap dress, meaning it opens completely up in the front. Something you look for in a wrap dress is a secure fit - you don't want it opening up on you! This dress was very secure, with the strap to wrap around, along with a very discreet snap closure. The side that flaps on top to close the dress did a bit of a sliding thing - where the inner material would flip a bit and display the not-so-pretty cream colored lining of the dress. That's my only complaint. The dress drapes and floats beautifully, and I would even consider renting it again!","24-Dec-2019"

It's a little fitted in the wrap part and is a bit thicker of a material there. I definitely should have sized up (I'm usually a 4-6/S and I got this in a small) but it runs more like junior sizing and I think I wold have been more comfortable in a M. The top part didn't really close all the way (I'm not big busted--about a 36A/34B) so fidgeting with that was a bit annoying which is why I only wore it once.

Granted, it may have been my body, but I’m willing to go out on a limb and say the model may have had some help with pinning to get that beautiful fit.

It's huge so definitely size down, even if you're like me and don't like your jumpsuits tight. I'm confident when wearing funky things, but sadly I only had events with strangers or work people rather than friends, so it never got worn because I didn't feel it was ever super appropriate (some people just don't appreciate the silky pajamas look). You 100% need heels/wedges to make this look not like a silky trash bag. My friends suggested a belt and I think that would have helped. The button closure isn't super tight so you might give a peek inside if standing/leaning at the right angle. If you think you can rock it and have a reason to wear it, definitely get it.","27-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sera-jumpsuit?color=024","Halester80","Fun jumpsuit","I like this a lot. It does have a ton of buttons making bathroom breaks a challenge. My friends also thought I was wearing an adult onesie, so just know it’s not for everyone.","26-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sera-jumpsuit?color=024","EP","Great for an Event","It's a silky, shiny fabric with gold button cuffs at the ankles. I paired it with some gold sandals and jewelry for a 1970's Virginia Slims Ad kind of look. Very unique piece, but I loved wearing it.","7-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sera-jumpsuit?color=024","Keaneznana7","Fun, Cool and comfortable","I felt like having an adult pajama party in this one. Loved the oversized fit and can be worn with heels or flats depending on the outing.","5-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sera-jumpsuit?color=024","secretsquirrel","Look","I loved this look, it’s a statement and is just as pictured.","5-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sera-jumpsuit?color=024","FunMom","Very oversized and too long","I liked the way it looked minus the length. It was too long for me but otherwise super cute. I’m 5’5 and the ankles were very bunched.","27-Sep-2019"

I got compliments every time I wore it. If it weren't $495, I'd buy it, but I'm totally going to order it again for my next Nuuly! :)","25-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sera-jumpsuit?color=024","sofiamaria","Love this Jumpsuit!","I absolutely love this jumpsuit. It fits me perfectly, I am a bit shorter so the legs are slightly too long but it was not a problem at all since the ankles are tight. The material is silky soft. Unfortunately, it wrinkles pretty easily but is for the most part not very noticeable since it is a very flowy piece. Love lounging around in it at home and I would definitely wear it out again!","6-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sera-jumpsuit?color=024","CourtneyKMC","completely see through","The jumpsuit is really cute. Relaxed fit and feels really nice. The downfall is it’s completely see through. Unless you intend on only wearing inside your house or wearing a full catsuit underneath I’d recommend passing.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","clairefraser","Super chic","This top looked super cute and sophisticated on! I really enjoyed wearing it and felt very chic!! I know one of the other comments said it looked cheap, but I felt it was quite the opposite when wearing!","15-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","federicia13","Beautiful Details","Got so many compliments! Loved this, runs a little big so I got an XS instead of a S and it fit great.","21-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","Lyndi","Cute but didn’t work","This was a very pretty top. I am a size small and it was quite large on me. I would size down if I ordered again.","13-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","Heyheylo","Cute but cheap","The top fit really well and I tucked it into my high wasted jeans. The only problem was both of the buttons on the right sleeve popped off super quick. I only wore this shirt one time.","31-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","cassie","Not flattering","It looked OK when tucked in, but it was a bit short and ballooned out and wasn't flattering. One of the buttons on the neckline was broken.","10-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","Jackie_B","Beautiful blouse","I wore this on New Years Eve and receivved a lot of compliments.","5-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","MCL","Beautiful","This is a beautiful top! It was light and easy and the neckline did not feel too high. Paired it with wife leg black pants and booties.","2-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","reba821","Fun and fancy!","Love the blue velvet.","1-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","PortlandGirl","Crushin’ Velvet & Poppin’ Buttons","Adore the blue velvet, but I wish it was a bit longer so that I could tuck this in without it coming untucked. Worn loose made me feel A bit like I was wearing a maternity top. The sleeves are the loveliest feature, and definitely play homage to old Hollywood glamour. I considered this a possible keeper until the buttons started falling off.","27-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","kcwilcox12","Great top for holiday parties/work!","I love this top, it's super versatile but the burnout-velvet like look adds something a bit different and special. Such a great top for fall/winter. and as per usual, tons of compliments! Fits really well, slightly oversized as pictured, I typically wear a L or XL because I prefer looser fits, super cute tucked in or French tucked.","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","Ceb0480","Broken Buttons","As soon as I put this on all 4 buttons popped right off! I could be believe it!","11-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","Winnie","Good for the holidays","I wore this to work and got tons of compliments and suggestions that I should wear it to holiday parties. I’m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because there is a lot of volume so you are required to tuck it in and it is a bit warm and doesn’t breathe much. Good for cold nights","5-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","ChicagoClassic","Bye Bye Buttons","Like some of the other reviews, the buttons fall off really easily. I only wore this once and within the first few hours I'd lost a button on the wrist and off the neck. Luckily I found them on my office floor but I just didn't love the top enough to sew them back on myself to wear again.","4-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","Gypsymonk","beautiful blouse","loved the way I felt in this. very elegant. I left three of the button on the neck undone and then folded it down. looked great. very classy and feminine","2-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","TheVerka","Gorgeous and lush","The only things I would tweak is how high the neck is and to definitely size down. It runs large so you'll have to a French tuck to make it look more streamlined. This looks like an expensive top and I decided to throw caution to the wind and wear it with a bralette vs a tank top. It is sheer but the dark color, fabric and flower patterns make it so it's hard to tell unless you're in direct sunlight. One of the button did pop off while i was trying it on but seems like an easy fix and it didn't impact how I could wear the top.","4-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/button-shoulder-blouse?color=041","Chocolatina","Versatile Top","Great top that can be worn at work, and after work for a date! The texture of the fabric is very nice. Best to wear it tucked in though, as it's very voluminous.","2-Nov-2019"
