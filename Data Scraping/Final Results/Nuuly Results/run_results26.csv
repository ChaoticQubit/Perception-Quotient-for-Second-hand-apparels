Instead it worked for what I describe to my friends as “paparazzi catches celebrity grocery shopping” look. Sweatpants or joggers, tee, slides, and an awesome statement jacket. A purse half the size of your body usually works for the look too. I felt really cool just going out to pick up prescriptions and walking my dog. I didn’t buy it, but if I had more social opportunities to wear it right now I probably would’ve. I’m usually a large, and this worked to wear open. If I wear going to zipper it in colder weather I’d probably have to size up.","15-Apr-2020"

I got compliments from women and men - everyone loved it. Probably got more compliments on this jacket than almost anything else I’ve ever worn before. It fit perfectly. I paired it with ripped light wash blue jeans and a black body suit. Paired it with an all black outfit first and it looked a little too biker-y so I switched to the blue jeans and it was perfect.","3-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/twyla-print-top?color=055","AmandaPattison","Romantic, Unique Top","I originally ordered this top in my very first Nuuly, in my normal size Small. It was uncomfortably tight under the arms and a bit short due to it being cropped--even with high waisted jeans I felt like I was pulling it down constantly. I decided to give it another shot in the next size up and I am so glad I did! It fits perfectly, and offers a touch more movement. Due to the fact that it's somewhat see-through, I don't mind it being a tad less form-fitting. This is not SO sheer that you need to wear anything underneath--I opted for a nude tone bra. I love the cut/fabric and print/color. As a pale redhead with green eyes, this is extremely flattering. I have a small bust (32B) but the cut of this helped to balance my fuller hips. Sexy but classy, and can be dressed more formal. I'm obsessed. I feel like a Pre-Raphaelite painting whenever I wear it!","6-May-2020"

This did not fit how it appears in the photos - it didn't even cover my belly button, and the neckline was extremely deep at that! It was all around just teeny tiny - shoulders were tight, sleeves didn't come to my wrists.. I was pretty bummed. Even sizing up to a large I would still worry this was an extreme crop top! I do have a more athletic, straight build, so maybe that's why... The material is super soft though, so if the fit was better, it would be extremely comfortable and stretchy!","26-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/twyla-print-top?color=030","GGHIRT","Love this top!","Love this top.. fits well. It’s a little see through in the light so be prepared to wear a bralette/cammy under.","1-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/twyla-print-top?color=030","LaurenD","Definitely size up, this runs sooo small!","I shop this brand often, so I expected the sizing to be true to size. This did not fit how it appears in the photos - it didn't even cover my belly button, and the neckline was extremely deep at that! It was all around just teeny tiny - shoulders were tight, sleeves didn't come to my wrists.. I was pretty bummed. Even sizing up to a large I would still worry this was an extreme crop top! I do have a more athletic, straight build, so maybe that's why... The material is super soft though, so if the fit was better, it would be extremely comfortable and stretchy!","26-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/twyla-print-top?color=030","Millie","Runs Small","This top was very cropped on me and incredibly tight in the bust and armpits. Usually, I wear an S in Free People, but for this top, I think sizing up would have been best for a cuter fit.","23-Nov-2019"

I don't think it's made for Hourglass figures. If you have big boobs and a small waist, the boxy cut and thick fabric don't offer enough structure for the waist.

Wore it for a fancy holiday party with black pumps and felt classy. The open back means you need to go braless so may be hard for ladies with a bigger bust, but for me worked great with pasties. Length was good for a tall lady like me. The only fit issue for me was that the open back was slightly loose on me. Also dressed it down with chunky boots and a leather jacket. Versatile.","6-Jan-2020"

The color, the fabric, pattern ... perfect. I'd been looking for an alternative cold-weather coat, and this looked like it. Unfortunately, the XL was just too wide -- sleeves too long, vast in girth -- on me. I'm typically as size 14, sometimes even a 16, and this was like standing under a tablecloth. Sadly.

They end right before my wrist (7/8 length), and I don't have long arms! I'd size up in general, and would definitely recommend sizing up if you want the oversized look the model is rocking.

The shoulders were pretty wide on me but I just had to wear it so I just took a pin and pinned the top so the shoulders stayed on. I will also add that my bra straps showed a little on the sides since the neckline is long so I just didn't wear a bra. The material was comfy and I wore the top with both blue and black jeans.","16-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wild-tee?color=004","MichelleP","Love the neckline","I wore this tee in more casual settings, mainly paired with jeans. The neck was so unique—but be warned: a strapless bra is may be best to wear, since it's so wide!","12-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wild-tee?color=004","hndennis","Unique","I loved the unique cut along the chest. You have to wear a lacy bra or a tank underneath it because a regular bra will peak out. The fit along the torso is tight and looks great with jeans.","25-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/wild-tee?color=004","HaleyC","Cute but too big and low","Loved the style of the shirt, but because it's very thin and the neck/shoulders are so wide and low, it was difficult to put an outfit together that wasn't too showy. I have smaller shoulders but a bigger bust (32E) and I think if I'd gone with a S, it'd have been a cute casual look. As it was, too low to wear to the office, too casual for night events where I would've been comfy wearing it. Size down and it's an adorable shirt!","16-Dec-2019"

Its a little lighter weight than I was expecting, but still surprisingly warm. As other reviewers mentioned, the one drawback is that the green side material clings to your clothes if you wear it green side in. This was not a deal breaker for me because I actually liked that green side out better. The pockets on the green side are horizonal slits and nice and deep, while the pockets on the grey side are less stylish looking. I wore this to work, with jeans, and even threw it on as I was running out the door to a workout class and was complimented even though I was wearing leggings and a t-shirt underneath.","21-Feb-2020"

Reversible was a big selling point - I’m looking to upgrade and replace a jacket I currently have. I wanted something with a hood that’s super versatile. Unfortunately, the green material on this jacket is a bit textured, so it makes anything you wear stuck to it and bunch up. So, any sweater I wore underneath bunched you when the jacket was switched with the black side out. It made the jacket pretty uncomfortable and not as wearable for me. Really wanted to like it more, but maybe for warmer weather when you’re not wearing sweaters under everything!!","29-Dec-2019"

Thought it would be good because it's reversible (and most of the jackets I really wanted were checked out :/ ). It's thinner than expected and not that warm. It runs a bit small in the shoulders and didn't allow for much underneath. And the green side is somewhat matte without a sealant and I was worried that it would stain in the cold weather. But I'm also from AZ and I don't really know how cold weather works! Do jackets stain from the dirty cities and the rain? Not sure lol.","18-Dec-2019"

If you are in between sizes or want to layer, size up.","5-Feb-2020"

I'm 5'7 and there was about and extra 3-4 inches of fabric on the floor. I almost killed myself tripping on it. Even with 3 inch heels it's too long. I used the tie to skooch it up. 2. It's also itchy and extremely see through. I'm not sure if that's what it's going for but the fabric is itchy so it would be ideal to have a liner. I wore a camisole and a slip underneath. I'm in quarantine so i didn't go anywhere with it but it was still nice to wear something fancy on my bday week.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bowie-graphic-sweatshirt?color=011","ChelseyLovesVintage","Meh","I ordered this sweater knowing it wasn't vintage but hoping it would, at least, look vintage. Well, it did not. While it was in brand new condition, it looked liked something you could pick up at Target. The brand of this sweater is Sugarhigh and Lovestoned so I know this is an expensive-ish label but I was very disappointed. Had I known it looked the way it did, I would have passed on it.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bowie-graphic-sweatshirt?color=011","SallyBrown","Space Oddity ;)","The vintage Bowie graphic caught my eye so I wanted to rent this for lounging over the holidays. It is soft fleece lining which was cozy, but overall this does run large. I rented my normal S, and I had to cuff the sleeves and tuck the hem up so it didn't look like a dress. Worth renting, but I'd suggest sizing down.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

Like a tunic or dress. Judging by the pictures, I thought it was cropped, but it was very difficult to style with skirts and high waisted jeans.","11-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bowie-graphic-sweatshirt?color=011","lucy123","Vintage cool","After reading the reviews, I went with an XS. As a taller person, I'm glad I sized down, because the fit was pretty good, if a little long in the body and sleeves. Nothing a French tuck into jeans, and one roll on the sleeves couldn't fix. Color was a little more vanilla/beige than the white it seems in pictures. Cozy and soft fleece inside.","4-Jan-2020"

I don't have much of a bust, but it still was too tight on the chest, which caused gaping between the buttons. The buttons themselves were very difficult to fasten which made it tough to get on or off. The fit also wasn't very flattering, leaving a boxy shape. I recommend ordering a size up and tucking it into either a skirt or pants to give it more shape.","26-Jan-2020"

They fit true to size...actually maybe a teeny bit more roomy than other sz 24 pants I've tried on. I didn't realize it from the photos, but these actually have a lot of stretch in them which made them extra comfortable. I'm short, so they weren't as cropped don me as the picture, but I still loved them and wore them several times. The color is also really nice and trendy. If I wore color more, I would totally buy these. But they were perfect to have for a month.","2-Jan-2020"

At first I loved them so much - perfect high waist, perfect cropped cut, perfect cord. But then I wore them and eh - they were comfy but something felt not quite right. Then I wore them one more time and pegged it. While they fit me perfectly in the waist, the way the fabric laid coming off my butt made them look super sloppy and saggy behind. It just didn’t match what I expected them to look like as I walked by a mirrored window and scoped out my own butt. :) Also the color is VERY pumpkiny which was a bit much for me.","18-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nellie-corduroy-culottes?color=066","Joanna","The perfect pants do exist!","I am absolutely in love with these pants. On top of looking super great and stylish, they are EXTREMELY comfortable. The material has just enough give so that I can wear them throughout the day, eat, and move around in them, and they’re never too tight. On the flipside, they never stretch out like some pants do, so I can wear them all the time and they never look too big even at the start of the day. Magic? The silhouette is also great. I’m 5’4’ and have a long torso. Sometimes pants of this cut aren’t very flattering on me since they can make my legs look shorter than they are. That was NOT the case with these pants. Definitely considering keeping them!","17-Nov-2019"

I wore them with everything and almost multiple times a week. The fit was true to size, no elastic in the waist. This was great to wear in the office all day because the legs aren't tight. I wish I could buy these, but they are still expensive used. I wore them with black strappy sandals, but they looked better with any heel.","15-Nov-2019"

They fit true to size...actually maybe a teeny bit more roomy than other sz 24 pants I've tried on. I didn't realize it from the photos, but these actually have a lot of stretch in them which made them extra comfortable. I'm short, so they weren't as cropped don me as the picture, but I still loved them and wore them several times. The color is also really nice and trendy. If I wore color more, I would totally buy these. But they were perfect to have for a month.","2-Jan-2020"

At first I loved them so much - perfect high waist, perfect cropped cut, perfect cord. But then I wore them and eh - they were comfy but something felt not quite right. Then I wore them one more time and pegged it. While they fit me perfectly in the waist, the way the fabric laid coming off my butt made them look super sloppy and saggy behind. It just didn’t match what I expected them to look like as I walked by a mirrored window and scoped out my own butt. :) Also the color is VERY pumpkiny which was a bit much for me.","18-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nellie-corduroy-culottes?color=027","Joanna","The perfect pants do exist!","I am absolutely in love with these pants. On top of looking super great and stylish, they are EXTREMELY comfortable. The material has just enough give so that I can wear them throughout the day, eat, and move around in them, and they’re never too tight. On the flipside, they never stretch out like some pants do, so I can wear them all the time and they never look too big even at the start of the day. Magic? The silhouette is also great. I’m 5’4’ and have a long torso. Sometimes pants of this cut aren’t very flattering on me since they can make my legs look shorter than they are. That was NOT the case with these pants. Definitely considering keeping them!","17-Nov-2019"

I wore them with everything and almost multiple times a week. The fit was true to size, no elastic in the waist. This was great to wear in the office all day because the legs aren't tight. I wish I could buy these, but they are still expensive used. I wore them with black strappy sandals, but they looked better with any heel.","15-Nov-2019"

I always wore it as a layering piece so it didn’t bother me. It does run fairly large.

I have a 36C chest and my boobs are very perky, this top is heavily lined with no support and it just wouldn't even stay up when i was standing still.

I'm short so it was a moment where I tried the sweater on and looked in the bathroom mirror at work and felt decidedly not as cute as when I first left the house which then I felt far less confident rocking it.

I sized down, since it looked like it ran large, but the hemline ended up falling at the widest part of me, while the neck came up too high. In all, it was just a little too boxy, even for a fun winter sweater. I wore it a couple times, but I'm glad it was a rental.","9-Feb-2020"

They paired easily with everything. They were neutral, and not attention-grabbing, but looked and felt great. I would have definitely bought them, but I've been losing weight and exercising a lot, so by the end of the month they were already a little loose (went from 140 to 135 pounds in the month, so likely would go from a 29 to a 28 if that helps you with choosing your size).","23-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sarah-slim-ankle-jeans?color=093","Linds22","Great jeans! A little small in the waist","These jeans are great quality! They run slightly smaller in the waist than most high-waisted jeans do...I have an athletic body type so high-waisted jeans usually solve the smaller waist and larger legs dilemma. These jeans fit perfectly in the legs for the straight, relaxed look but ran smaller in the waist. I was able to button them, and the waist stretched out gradually as I wore them but was initially more snug than I would like. 4 stars because the quality of the jeans was great but it ran smaller than other Paige jeans typically do.","16-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sarah-slim-ankle-jeans?color=093","emily_","Amazing Jeans","I absolutely loved these jeans. The denim was so soft but never lost its shape or structure. I was worried at first that they were going to be too small (I'm either a 32 or 31 depending on the brand), but the size 31 loosened up just enough and were super comfortable. I wore these a ton and will probably rent again.","14-Mar-2020"

If the rise was an inch or so higher, I would probably have purchased them and had them hemmed (they are super long, but that's to be expected for someone who is 5'1). I normally wear a size 26, but based on other reviews, I sized up here and can confirm that was wise - these run a little smaller than other brands.

They feel nothing like the stretchy jeans I had tried, and I was initially disappointed. I don't wear rigid denim, as I find it too uncomfortable for my curves. However, I gave these a chance and they do get more comfortable with frequent use. The fact that they're a harder denim also makes them look polished and stay that way throughout the day. I don't know that I'd keep these, but I'm glad I tried them. They're definitely a nice looking pair and easy to style.","27-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/simone-striped-sweater?color=090","Review_Reader","cozy, bright sweater","Loved this cheery, bright sweater to brighten up those gloomy winter days while keeping me warm. It was a bit thick, so it did not fit under my leather jacket, but was great to be cozy on colder days under a larger winter coat. Loved the colors though the fit was a bit boxy, so I'm glad that I got an XS instead of my normal S. Wore it with high-waisted skinny jeans (to balance out the boxy top) as well as a casual pencil skirt to work and with navy leggings on the weekend to the park with my kid. It worked well in all circumstances and got so many compliments on the colors","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I wore this to dinner, to work, it was a favorite. Very soft. Would say that it did not me as slouchy as it appears in the picture- if you want it to be slouchy, I would say order a size or two up. I will order this again!","14-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/simone-striped-sweater?color=090","Shiny","Not for me","My first box came today. Everything was great except this item. It was oversized but also from the side it turned me into a triangle — so it fully flared out in the front, that made me look pregnant with an angular belly. Definitely not for me. It did look nice in a tight cropped selfie — but I would say the v neck was the only redeeming quality for me.","23-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/run-with-me-cardi?color=001","elissa94","More of a shirt than a cardigan","The sleeves were much puffier than I expected and the lace neckline looks very thick on me, it doesn’t look like a very modern piece which was a disappointment","5-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/run-with-me-cardi?color=001","hndennis","Beautiful lavender color","I loved the lace along the chest and the color is gorgeous. It is more of a crop shirt so looks well with high waisted jeans or if you want to show your stomach a bit too.","25-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/run-with-me-cardi?color=001","SarahPaige13","You won't want to return","This is the perfect little top! Perfect for going out, but can also be casual. It's also the perfect length. Not too cropped but hits right above your hips. I will be purchasing!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I'm usually between a small and medium in tops and the small fit perfectly. I wore it mostly with wide-leg cropped cords. It's simple enough to pair with anything and adds a little flair.","3-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/run-with-me-cardi?color=001","kiki89","adorable and flirty","I love this cardigan! It runs a little big but I got it a size up to be comfortable. It stretches a bit. It has the most beautiful lace detailing and puff sleeves - great for going out.","16-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/seeking-starlight-plaid-buttondown?color=049","VictoriasAttic","Slim sleeves, but love it anyway!","Super soft and comfy. There are seams across the upper arms and back that weren't tight but you can feel the seams. The sleeves are slimmer than I expected but not too tight to roll them up. Great top overall!","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/seeking-starlight-plaid-buttondown?color=049","ReeBee","Keeper","This top has some cute details that make it stand out from a standard plaid shirt. It’s pretty roomy, but the oversized look works. Loved it!","16-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/seeking-starlight-plaid-buttondown?color=049","emmyfromtheblock","Great top, easy to wear","Loved this top! So soft and so easy to throw on and go. Easily pairs with denim or a stretch bottom, and has great form and swing to the shape. Runs large, but very cozy. Perfect for fall!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/seeking-starlight-plaid-buttondown?color=049","Kellyjay111","OMG is this top cute","Runs big but super flattering over a skinny black midi dress - I’m a size 8 and ordered the xs - LUV this top","3-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/seeking-starlight-plaid-buttondown?color=049","Sara","SO SOFT","Love this shirt!! It is so soft and cozy, and the fabric and the drapey construction are very breathable. Like many Free People items, it's cut large so it's extra roomy with a feminine flounce. I wore it by itself with bralettes and I also wore it as outerwear - like a cross between your boyfriend's flannel and a cozy sweater. I don't feel like the pics do justice to the soft, pretty colors and little details like the striped cuff lining fabric or the frayed hem. I'll definitely rent it again...may have to buy it!","24-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","laurenkelcie","Really Cute & Flattering","This sweater is amazing!! I only got to wear it once unfortunately, but it was really flattering and a very comfortable fabric. I do have to say, it is very cropped so definitely wear very high waisted pants with it if you don't want your stomach showing. Thankfully that's basically all I own.","29-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","chelseaclayborn","Pretty color, too cropped","Coming from someone who loves cropped everything this was just a bit too cropped. I think I prefer to be able to have the option to tuck a sweater and that was just not an option for this. It is thin and comfortable","13-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","ehf109","Cute winter to spring sweater","Super cute, definitely cropped and not very thick. Sleeves are very long, so on someone shorter than 5'6 or 7, this might not work.","10-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","Roanne86","Way too cropped","Liked the color and bell sleeve style however it was so cropped that even with 9-10 inch high rise jeans my stomach still showed. I am not in an age range where this is appropriate so did not end up wearing","2-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","LBandthecity","Long sleeves and crop top","The color is beautiful. The sleeves are very long and feel a tad bit like a crop top.","1-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","brooke23","Too cropped","Much more cropped than I expected. Falls oddly on the sides almost like it tried to be tapered and not as boxy, but it actually makes it shorter on the sides.","29-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","BritN","Cropped Sweater","Very flattering & fun. Wore this out a few times with high waisted jeans. Loved the bell sleeves and cropped length. Easy throw on sweater for a night out","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","CityGirl","Perfect pop of pink","What a solid sweater. The color is beautiful and just soft enough that it blends. The flared sleeves are fun but understated. The cropped is a little too-cropped for me but I’ve made it work by making sure I wear it with high-waisted bottoms or over a dress.","24-Feb-2020"

I loved this sweater. Cute color, awesome cowl neck/turtle neck look, and looks great with high waisted jeans. Yes, it is super cropped, so don't let that surprise you. But CUTE! SO CUTE!","11-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","Kkur","Odd shape, can't really work in it","Cute and fashion forward but the sleeves are very dramatic. I wasn't really able to wear this anywhere without getting the sleeves in everything. The crop was cute though, definitely not a work top.","9-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","LTS","Too cropped for a tall gal","Unfortunately, this sweater was too cropped for me to wear. I do like wearing cropped sweaters and tucking the front into high waisted jeans, but this one was even too short for that. Color was cute and fabric was comfortable though. Probably best for shorter ladies :)","3-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","CMC90","It’s okay","Giving it four stars because there is nothing wrong with the top, the styling just wasn’t for me. If you know you love this style of top, go for it. For me it was just kind of “fine”- nothing to write home about","10-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","ferra1395","Fun color!","Word to the wise, this is cropped! I wore with high rise jeans during the day and high rise black pants when I wanted to dress it up. Love the bell sleeves and received so many compliments on the color!","5-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/in-love-with-lilac-sweater?color=055","JmeK","Very Short Crop","Love the sleeves and the neckline. But the crop is SO short. You would need high waisted pants up to your bra if you didn't want to show any tummy. Or an undershirt but I feel that would look odd. Maybe if you had small breasts it would be ok, but at a D cup the girls would be playing peekaboo if I raised my arms above my head.","25-Nov-2019"
