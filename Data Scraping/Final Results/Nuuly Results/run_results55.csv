"https://www.nuuly.com/products/janet-sleeveless-turtleneck-sweater?color=018","Livi","Cute but not for everyone","Definitely runs small, might look better on bigger busts/smaller waists but didn't find it very flattering. The arm holds were bigger than I thought they would be which made it look a little weird also.","5-Mar-2020"

I’m a C cup but, it sort of gave the top a weird shape on me. My roommate who is an A-cup tried it and it looked fantastic on her. I think this top is better suited for women with smaller busts.","18-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/janet-sleeveless-turtleneck-sweater?color=018","broadkill","Bigger Boobs Beware","This is a great top. I got loads of compliments on it. My only complaint is that it fits a little, uh, strange, if you have a larger chest -- or a pair that sits lower on your chest. I found myself constantly tugging the armpits up to make my boobs look less awkward, but then the top bunched up. It is also very stretchy, so perhaps size down!","10-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/janet-sleeveless-turtleneck-sweater?color=018","ASale","Obsessed -- very flattering","Looks very small when you hold it up, but it stretches perfectly and fits very comfortably.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","voldy","Baggy, cool and fun to wear","This was a bit faded, like others have said, but I didn't mind. The fit was really cool and the mismatched sleeves are fun. Loved wearing this with skinny jeans.","23-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","lemon14","simply cute","It’s cute and soft, just as pictured. Pretty comfy. Nice going out / work shirt","2-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","Nettispaghetti","SUPER Sweater","this sweater slaps. its comfy and fairly warm for being on the thinner side. the only reason its not a 5/5 stars is because the colors are NOWHERE near as bright as the photo which was a slight disappointment. i still wore it a good amount tho! Just know the colors are definitely muted","14-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","hamu","Love!! Super comfy, cool sweater","I loved this sweater. Unfortunately, it was still a bit out of my price range, even with the discount. This sweater is extremely comfortable and lightweight, even though it's a turtleneck. I was kept warm in it, yet was never too hot. I got a lot of compliments when I wore this because the pattern is very unique and cool! Sleeves were just a tad short on me because it's one size fits all I guess. However, everything else was perfect! Wish I could've kept it.","30-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","clarekhogan","Just okay","This sweater is definitely on the thinner side, but still pretty comfy! I will say though, the colors are a little different than they look in the picture -- the ""red"" is more of a dull fuschia, which was not my favorite.","28-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","k8isgr8","SO cute, vintage feel and very cozy","I loved this sweater so much! A lot of people asked if it was thrifted or vintage. Perfect boyfriend fit and very soft.","21-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","Rosefedelia","Love the material and the fit","Wore it with a cute jacket and dark jeans","19-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","Dre","Great fit, soft, but looks worn out","It fit perfect for a short person, even though it is a one size. If you are tall, stay away because the length of the arms is on the shorter side. Love the print, but the colors are fading, not in a good way, and that distracted from how nice the sweater is.","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","eyelinerdiner","Cute, 80s, a bit weird","Obviously this is supposed to be oversized, which is cute. The sleeves were a little too billowy for my liking, though. Also, it felt SO 80s.","15-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","KLMS","Love the look!","This sweater is super cute. One sizing fits all though is not totally accurate. The sleeves were very short and you couldn’t push them up they wouldn’t stay at all. Not sure if that was because it had been worn too many times or not.","12-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","carlijeen","Mixed feelings","I like the sweater. Super soft. Good to go under jackets. Pattern is a bit much... even for me. But I do really like it!","4-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","Cmozafari","Great colors","Loved the colors of this sweater. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it filled a good slot in my wardrobe. I don't know it was the most flattering, but I guess that's a horizontal striped sweater for you.","26-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-turtleneck-sweater?color=009","Sydney12x","Retro arcade aesthetic","This was a really cool, oversized sweater that you can get creative with.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","Foxheart","Fun and easy to wear!","Comfy and stylish with jeans and quarantine yoga pants. Sleeves perfect to be seen on conf calls. Only issue is that they loosened up too much.","18-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","VanessaV","Nice lounging cardigan","Comfy non-itchy cardigan with a little style from the stripes. Per other reviews I sized down and am glad I did; I could maybe even have gone down two sizes. The cardigan really stretches out quickly when you wear it but it's totally fine for hanging around at home.","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","ALS949","Too long.","Cute but I didn’t care for how long it was. If you like a long cardigan style, this is a good one.","3-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","Charis","Cozy, comfy","This is a cozy, slouchy sweater, perfect for running errands or relaxing at home.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","Personpdx","Nice cardigan","This one stayed with me. It’s comfortable and is the right weight for wearing in the soggy state where I live or for going down to LA on my winter family bonding trips. The fabric is soft and comfortable, I like the contrasting sleeves which save it from boring. It is also long enough for a tall woman.","10-Dec-2019"

Its okay, nothing special, definitely wouldn't have bought it at a store, but it is functional and fine enough...","2-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","Yello","Just ok, little big","I thought the sweater was cute but it was pretty big and baggy. I could have gone with a XS but it wasn’t made that small. The sleeves are the only interesting part of the sweater, but because it’s rubbed knit, you have to be careful not to stretch out the fabric.","24-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","Jmslovesclothes","So flattering and unique","So flattering and the sleeves were so cute! My go to for work as well as out and about. I get compliments every time I wear it - So I bought it :)","10-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","vms5112","Cute but sleeves are large","This is a super cute sweater, but the sleeves fit very oddly. They are extremely long and very bulky, so they really can't be pushed up without adding a ton of bulk.","8-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","KC","Cute sleeve detail","Loved the color pop on the sleeve but mostly loved the cut. It looks like your usually cozy cardigan but because of the way it’s cut, it kys in a way that is very slimming and a bit more refined than a chunky version","28-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","Ashley123","Nothing special","This ended up being just fine for me. Nothing too special - I wear it around my apartment but haven't worn it out yet. Cute, fits well, well made - just not my typical go to!","26-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","AmyD","Sleeves sold me but rest of cardigan did not","This would work better on a tall and thin build. I liked the sleeve contrast but once I received the cardigan -- was too long everywhere and was just average in looks","21-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/navy-blue-cardigan-coverup?color=041","KTB33","Size down","This sweater is very cute. It's a heavier material than I thought it would be, and it's great quality. I would size down at least one size because the sleeves are quite big and stretch out throughout the day.","10-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","daribelle","A bit too chunky/collar folded in","This was cute but didn't lay as nicely as in the photos. It is much thicker than I expected and though I did wear it a few times it was definitely not as flattering as I hoped. More of a cozy at-home vibe.","21-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","Hahnshuler","Long —and I’m tall","It’s not that it’s not ‘true to size’ I just felt that the fringe location was too low on the chest and I’m very long through the torso. That alone could have been tolerable but with the short turtle collar and longer length, everything felt... droopy. Right out of the box it was a fave —soft, stylish and well-made, but when I actually was getting dressed I couldn’t make it work.","5-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","lek24","Comfy and cozy","This sweater was super comfortable and warm - maybe a little TOO warm. It's a cute variation to a plain cream sweater.","4-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","Mspickles","Perfect way to wear fringe","This sweater is a perfect way to do fringe- cute but not overwhelming. It was very soft and warm and wasn’t itchy at all.","4-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","Ssteeves","Good in theory!","I really wanted to like this sweater! I didn’t actually find an issue with the length like other reviewers but the overall design of the sweater is overwhelming. The fringe was too puffy for my body and I felt very strange in it. Maybe it would be better for someone taller!","7-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","emilyh","So cute!","The perfect classic but trendy sweater!","6-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","gabeb","Very cute, too big","The style of this sweater is really cute. I got a small, and thought it would fit nicely, but it was very long on my 5'3"" frame, and wide. When tucked into jeans, because it was so long it would buckle out and make me look much larger than I am, so I wore it without tucking in. Cute, but not perfect.","29-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","MelMarPie","Fun and Fringy!!","Wore with just a plain pair of blue jeans, let the sweater do all the talking!","27-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","LizV","Very Bulky","Liked this sweater but it was much bulkier than the photo making me look wide. Only wore once. Difficult to style due to its bulk.","19-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","EmilyElizabethWilliams","Super Cute and Fun","I love this sweater! It is a little bulky as other reviews said but perfect for a night out to dinner. I was glad I got a small because it does run a little big. I paired it with black jeans and boots.","18-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","hannahd","Long","This was muuuch longer than I anticipated, but with a front tuck still completely wearable. So warm & cozy! Loved the knitted, cozy look of it!","14-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","aracelicristina","Simple Fringe Sweater","I’m usually a S but I ordered an XS since that was the only size available. Still fit me loose so I guess that means this fits larger than size. Only thing, and unsure if it’s because I got an XS. The sweater hit at an awkward point hallway through my hips which made them look larger than they already are. Beautiful sweater otherwise.","9-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","Hayleybean","Loved!","Really loved this sweater! The fringe detail is super cute. It’s definitely a thicker sweater so it’s perfect for colder days.","4-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","dresses2spinin","Fun + Different","This sweater is cute and a unique, wintry piece. It's more of a turtleneck than the pictures make it seem, and you may want to size down. Not worth a buy, in my opinion, but fun to add to a rental mix.","29-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","Oh_sue","Cute style, not so cute fit","I wanted to love this so bad. Fringe is so cute but runs large.","17-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","Sunkisterin","A winter staple","This sweater is great. I honestly could wear it every day - easy to dress up with a skirt or dress casual with a jean jacket and leggings. I loved how the fringe made it more interesting than a basic crew but it was still neutral enough to wear a lot of different ways. Only call out is the fit is pretty boxy so in my opinion it looks better in person than in photographs (if that matters to you :) )","30-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","ChicagoTrekker","Very warm - but so cute","Love this sweater. It fit well - it is extremely warm though which is perfect for the winter. I got a little hot in it inside but got so many compliments when wearing it.","25-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","Mal","Not for petites","A lot of fabric on this one. It runs so long that it's just not a good sweater for petites. I felt like I was drowning in it, and when I tried to French tuck it, there was just so much fabric that it kind of looked ridiculous. Would be very cool on a taller frame.","15-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","annamcam","Gorgeous, but not for me","Wanted to love this, but it was a little baggy. I wish it had been more cropped and wasn't so tight at the neck. Still a gorgeous color and style.","28-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","deapon","Very cute and thick sweater","This sweater was super cute and I got a lot of compliments - however it is VERY thick, so wear on cold days.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","olive123","cozy oversized sweater","This sweater is perfect for when you want to feel super cozy. The fringe is a fun accent to a cream-colored sweater. I would size down one size as it's pretty long and a little bulky. Overall, I am happy with the rental but wouldn't buy it.","11-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","imbrittanynicole","So cozy and comfy!","Fall came super fast in Portland and I was freezing one day and threw this sweater on and OMG it is so warm and cozy and amazing!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-knit-sweater?color=011","CRV","Thick!","This sweater is pretty chunky. Unfortunately, it was too thick to wear in September but will probably pick it again come November/December.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tennis-sweater?color=011","rkjt","Warm, oversized and cozy","This is oversized, so ""true to size"" means a little big and baggy.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tennis-sweater?color=011","Katie123","Super Cute","I really liked this sweater and got it in a small, which based on the reviews seemed like it would be a little large, which was what I was going for.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tennis-sweater?color=011","somethingfrommyshelf","My Ideal Sweater","The Pros: I loved so much about this sweater that just listing the pros is difficult. The over-sized fit was perfect, especially since the sleeves were fitted around the wrist, the v-neck was very flattering (not too low, not too high), and the knit was so plush. It's fairly casual, so I only wore this around the house and on the weekends, but my GOD, I was always comfortable. The Cons: Did I even have cons? Maybe the material was a little acrylic-y but I didn't mind because the fit was so cozy. The Verdict: The perfect over-sized preppy sweater. Wear this on a casual weekend when you want to look effortlessly put-together, but want to feel as cozy as can be.","27-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lola-plaid-kick-flares?color=049","TessG","Soft and Stylish Vintage Look","I wore these pants out, to work and for day-to-day activities. They are lined with a warm material so they are perfect for a fall day or a warmer winter day. I am 5'8' and 118lbs and size 4 was perfect. I ended up purchasing because how comfortable and chic they turn an entire outfit. They looked great with all different types of sweaters and turtlenecks. One time I wore them with a yellow furry jacket and it made a 70s inspired look come to life. I woul 12/10 get these pants if you are looking for a cool day to night piece, or just something to switch up your pant collection. My favorite part of them is how you can dress them up or down, I think they would look great with a jean jacket too. I got so many compliments on these pants, you will not regret these.","10-Nov-2019"

They also have a bit of a fuzzy lining inside so seem like the perfect fall pant. However the colorway wasn't what I expected -- I thought it would be a classic plaid, but it has more pink in it, which really isn't my style. I also felt like because the pants are so form-fitting, they hugged my mid section in a way I didn't find to be super flattering. I feel like I would get these pants if they had them in black!","12-Aug-2019"

The quality is impeccable and I loved how the Remy jeans fit me, so I decided to give these a try. This model wasn't very flattering on my body type, I have thick legs but they're very straight, I don't have much change in girth from my thighs all the way down to my ankles, and these pants made my legs look wider than they are if that makes any sense... They didn't work for me, but I'm sure they would look wonderful in other body types.","7-May-2020"

The fit was great thru the leg and there is a nice crop for me (5'9"") with the slightest kick flare. I have about 15 potential outfits ready to go. They look great with Birkenstocks and with my Rothy's. they are high enough that I can actually use some of the crop tops I'd thought I'd outgrown at 39. No skin peeking between.

That being said, this jumpsuit is AMAZING in person! The weight and material were perfect. I could see this being a nice transitional piece. I had some many ideas on how to style this had it worked. The style of the top would look great on a smaller and larger (me) bust which to be honest is rare. I was hopeful this would work out but it was a few inches too short in the torso. I was so sad that it did not work for me. This would look amazing on someone with a much shorter torso.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I usually wear a 24 in pants, and as the other reviews said they were too big. No belt loops either so no way to make the waist smaller. They were baggy all the way down and I probably looked 10 pounds heavier than I am. Despite them being too big, the denim was very thick and stiff with no stretch so I could see how these would be difficult to get the right fit if you were curvier. The last disappointment was that the lace detailing on the side showed a bit of wear. The first nuuly item I've been disappointed in.","18-Mar-2020"

I gave the 28 a try because someone reviewed them as running big, however, I learned that they do not. In typical Free People denim style, these did not work for my curvy lower half body type. If you have any type of curves, these are most likely not the pants for you. The denim does not give at all. I was able to get them up and buttoned, but they were too tight to comfortably move around and they were too long for me.

You can probably get away with sizing down on this one, but even if you opt for your usual size, the fit can be customized thanks to the drawstring/tie neck. I recommend wearing with a cute bandeau or bralette because the sides are a bit open. It looks great with a flatform sandal. I am 5'6' and this hit me mid-calf.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

First, I sized down two sizes and it's still quite baggy. Second, I tied a black ribbon belt right about that tricky first ruffle to make an empire waist. Then I topped with a slim cut yellow cardigan. The belt added shape and the cardi slimmed the overall silhouette. I could not have sized down further and fit my bust properly. The fabric is a rayon, but feels like a heavy linen. My advice is to size down to the size you think you couldn't wear.

With an easy fit and dropped armholes, this one fits the bill. Everywhere I went, strangers complimented my dress and asked me where I bought it. Bonus!! You can probably get away with sizing down on this one, but even if you opt for your usual size, the fit can be customized thanks to the drawstring/tie neck. I recommend wearing with a cute bandeau or bralette because the sides are a bit open. It looks great with a flatform sandal. I am 5'6' and this hit me mid-calf.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

This is the first item I wore from my first ever Nuuly, and I have worn it multiple times already!! It's reallllllly comfortable and looks nice with a cute bralette. Fabric feels high quality. It hits true ankle length on me (I'm 5'7"") and worked well with both flats and heels. Runs a little large but the fit is flexible because of the style. The neck tie in the back is adjustable too (and really pretty). Def recommend!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/contrast-plaid-midi-skirt?color=000","MK","A little Holly Hobbie","The fit would be perfect for me save for the length. It comes to my ankles, which is not terribly flattering. The belt is also bizarrely long and wraps all the way around to the middle, back belt loop. Why provide such a long belt when the skirt can only accommodate a 25–26"" waist in XS? And why won't the buckle sit straight but always tilts to the side? I was also a little disappointed in the fabric, which I expected to be more structured. It's pretty drapy and flannel-like, which just makes it look a little Holly Hobbie.","14-Oct-2019"

The only real wear I noticed was the logo on the waistband was completely worn off, and ended up being the reason I didn't keep them.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/normani-bias-printed-skirt?color=025","LM27","Cute Pattern but Awkward","This skirt has a super awkward fit. Based on the picture I imagined it would fit like my other silk midi skirts with a slight flow, instead the side hem is straight down, and thus it is tighter and less flexible when wearing. Not to mention something is very off about the waist, it is super tight on the top seam, this makes it dig in deep at the very top but then it has more room below, making it not super flattering on the stomach. Really not sure why they would make this seam so tight when they could have opted for a more uniform wider waist band or some sort of elastic.

Unfortunately, the waist closure was a bit too snug for my taste. I am usually a comfortable 4 but it just did not feel right. Going up on the size would not help, as the fabric does not have any flex so the pin tuck/stitching would be too baggy. Oh well.... onto the next piece in my delivery!","17-Aug-2019"

I love the look of it, especially the pattern, flow and length. It did have a unusual neckline from most dresses I’ve seen out and about, kind of square and very high. If you’re all right with a high neckline, give it a shot. It’s very comfortable and easy to put on.","21-Jan-2020"

It is a smocked stretchy skirt in reality and I didn't think it was as cute IRL. It is also just way too long. I didn't even realize there was a zipper on the side until half way through the day, when I felt it re-rolling the falling waist. The cute tucked in shirt in the picture would be impossible unless you are about 6 feet tall. I'm 5'6"" and rolled it at least three times.

I paired it with the Midnight Vibes Blouse by Free People (also from Nuuly) to a wedding and got SO many compliments. The top is cropped so it met the waistline of the skirt perfectly and many thought it was a dress. I also paired it with a vintage Harley Davidson T-Shirt with a leather Jacket for a more casual look. The material is super stretchy and kind if thin so even though it’s patterned you may see lumps and bumps if you don’t wear spanks. That said, its super versatile and comfy. It does stretch out pretty easily so I’d keep that in mind. It’s also pretty long so plan to wear heels or folding the band inward and blousing a top over it.","8-Oct-2019"

As other reviewers have said, it's just way too big. I ordered the large petite, and it was dragging on the floor and the waist was too large. I would definitely recommend sizing down. It was so lovely, though, that I wore it a few times. I didn't style it much -- just a black shirt with metallic Birkenstocks for a fun fall/summer look.","22-Sep-2019"

I wore this to a very formal wedding and it was perfect. The cut is super flattering and really accentuated my waist. The only thing to note is that the fabric on the high neckline is a tiny bit itchy, but once you start indulging in champagne, you don't even notice.","24-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","SS","Very cute but slightly uncomfortable","Wore this to a fall wedding and got tons of compliments. Very fun to dance in, but the lace at the neck and the zipper both chaffed, leaving me with red welts for a couple of days after.","22-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","cmn290","Beautiful dress, must get!","I wore this dress to a wedding. It hit more like half-way down my calf. I paired it with nude heels. The dress can be a little hot to dance in, but not impossible! After wearing the dress for almost nine hours, the bottom of my neck had light bruise-like marks that went away after a few days. So be warned, the dress can start to get heavy. I would absolutely wear this dress again. It was perfect for the occasion and received lots of compliments.","15-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","Nicc","Beautiful but not flattering for my shape!","This dress was beautiful! It fit perfect at the top but could have been a little tighter in the waist and bottom area. I tried it on a couple of times for a wedding but didn't end up wearing it. It didn't do anything for my shape. Too much fabric at the bottom for me.","8-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","Robbiesue","Truly stunning dress. The details of lace and embroidery were beautiful. Runs small around the waist. Size large worked for me as a size 10.","I had planned to wear for my anniversary dinner in Napa but the weather was too warm. So I dressed it down for work with a wrap sweater and quirky polka dot heels.","8-Oct-2019"

Its so well made, i love the floral embroidery and how it cinches at the waist to flatter my figure. Just so beautiful. I wish i didnt have to send it back","6-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","OandTsMama","Gorgeous dress","Really beautiful dress, but the fit was off for me. I have a very long torso, but the torso on this dress was still too long for me! It was also very tight on top. Wish I could have worn it because it is beautiful but just not the right fit for my body. FYI it is also very heavy!","2-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","imbrittanynicole","Beautiful but not very comfortable","I love this dress by the looks only. It's gorgeous and looks so luxe. However, it was super tight - I'm a true Medium and when I put this on I was able to zip it up all the way, but it looked like I was gonna bust out of it. It's also a little itchy, even if it fit right I don't think I could wear it for more than a couple hours without losing my mind.","30-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","Hantheman","Absolutely stunning","Was in love with this dress online and even more in person. I wore it to a formal wedding in Nantucket in September. Strangers were complimenting me ALL night (one even said next to the bride, this was the most beautiful dress there). It fit very true to size, I am 5’8” though so keep that in mind if you’re a little shorter! One note: it is VERY heavy. So if you like lighter, flowy garments, this is NOT for you. Would rent again.","27-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","lpet","Jaw Dropper","This dress is a work of art! From the lace to the embroidery, lining, layers of ruffle, and the finished seams, the construction of this dress is impeccable! It’s unique and flattering and I got endless compliments. So impressed with this one. You have to see it in person! I will say that there isn’t much elasticity in the waist. I got lucky that the waist was the right fit for me. Definitely recommend renting this piece!!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","ashleyk","Stunning","The photos do not do this dress justice, it's so eye catching; the embroidery is beautiful, the structure is amazing, I could go on. Being 5'1"" this dress was the perfect length, closer to a maxi, hitting right at my ankles. Since I do have a shorter torso and wider hips, the apliqué that cinches the waist in did not hit at the right spot and cause the top portion to bunch in the back where the zipper is. If I was going to an event where I could wear a jacket or something to cover that up, you better believe I would have. Rent this dress!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","Joy","Not for me","I chose this dress for a cocktail event , hoping it’ll be as cute on me as the model but it just wasn’t meant to be . It was very large on me and almost a maxi length . I will say this is my first with this style of dress so maybe that’s why it wasn’t a match","8-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/bridget-ruffle-midi?color=001","aponomarev","Bridget Ruffle Midi","The dress is well-made and looks expensive. It was too long and kind of bulky on me (I am 5.6""). It runs true to size, however, has no stretch. I usually wear an XS and this is what I got, the size was good.","2-Aug-2019"
