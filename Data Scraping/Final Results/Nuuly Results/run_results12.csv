I wore it to my weekly grocery store outing and felt like Stevie Nicks in American Horror Story. I'm usually a small in Free People dresses so I'd say it runs true to size. Can be dressed up or down so very versatile. The bows on the sleeves are an awesome detail.","8-May-2020"

This was a big miss for me!","30-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lets-be-friends-midi-dress?color=001","Lalalauren","Hmmm","I cannot imagine this dress fitting anyone’s body type. There’s a huge gaping hole in the back that hung down to my thighs so my entire bum was exposed. There were a bunch of straps on the back that are presumably supposed to help shape the dress but I could not distinguish up from down, or left from right. Huge around the bust area. No thank you.","28-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lets-be-friends-midi-dress?color=001","laurajrogers","Wanted to Like","I really wanted to like this dress. But it just didn't fit my body type. It was a hard to get it secured tightly in the back, and the shoulders kept falling down.","25-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lets-be-friends-midi-dress?color=001","Winnie13","Amazing sleeve, tough bust","I wear a small in FP dresses and this was true to size. Sleeves are gorgeous but I think this is tough for a larger chest as you need to go bra-less due to the gorgeous open back.. wore once but felt uncomfortable with how much back was exposed.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/osaka-relaxed-straight-leg-jean?color=040","HRae","Second attempt","I originally rented these jeans in size 26 and they were so amazing but fit too loose so for some reason I was like “I should go 2 (!!!) sizes down” and with the 24 I couldn’t even wear them so lesson is to just go down 1 size from your normal size.

This is such a fresh silhouette and a great way to try something a little newer. These won't work for everyone but I felt they hit at the perfect cropped length. They were just a touch on the larger size around the waist I'm usually a 27/28 and given these sit at the waist with no belt loops I should've gotten the 27. I'll definitely be renting again in the small size and potentially purchasing!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

They were really large on me and with no belt loops I couldn't really do anything about it so i just rocked it super saggy. I'd recommend going down 1-2 sizes. The denim was really soft and comfy and I really loved the dart details on the sides. I'm 5'4"" and it still felt cropped at the ankle which was great. I'll probably re-rent these in the future, but just a smaller size to make it perfect.","12-Feb-2020"

That being said, you need to wear an undershirt to pull this off in winter, and its a bit hard to match colors for a few reasons. If you wear the sweater similar to the way the model does in the picture (resting the color higher on your chest) you'll have a lot of open space in the back. I found wearing white or a 'close match' in color was distracting when viewing it from the back (especially if you have short hair that can't cover it). It does seem like it would be a good sweater for any occasion though (even on cool summer nights) and definitely sits really well on your frame.","7-Mar-2020"

That being said, you need to wear an undershirt to pull this off in winter, and its a bit hard to match colors for a few reasons. If you wear the sweater similar to the way the model does in the picture (resting the color higher on your chest) you'll have a lot of open space in the back. I found wearing white or a 'close match' in color was distracting when viewing it from the back (especially if you have short hair that can't cover it). It does seem like it would be a good sweater for any occasion though (even on cool summer nights) and definitely sits really well on your frame.","7-Mar-2020"

The photos make it look a little chenille in my opinion, but it’s actually a little less soft, but still comfy. There are three different shades of coral/orange thread in the sweater all together.

It is sort of between a pale pink and peach, it is a bit on the boho side and you need to wear a camisole under it. I liked how it fit, wanted something loose and comfy but not sloppy. Wore with some wild embroidered jeans and will probably wear again with skinny jeans.Fit great! I am tall and so tired of half of the new styles in clothing being cropped on me.

It looks so good on you."" and has made several comments again too. I don't know what he loves so much about it but I have to say it is a winner in all ways.

I unbuttoned and re-buttoned but couldn’t get it to look right. If you are a 10 or smaller, this might look amazing on you. This felt more like a junior cut for a skinnier body type. Absolutely didn’t work for this Apple shape.","18-Feb-2020"

Like most Free People garments, it runs LARGE. I was curious how a size S would fit, but given the sleeves are MASSIVE on the XS, I stuck with that. Rented multiple times, but found cheaper on another site, so purchased elsewhere. I have worn this so much it's not even funny.","16-Apr-2020"

I didn’t expect it to fit as this brand can be all over the place in their fits. This jacket was quite large on me but in random spots. The bottom hit well below my backside-this was almost a dress in me. The sleeves were easily 2-3in too long. The sleeve width was certainly too baggy and the waist was oddly too tight. Small note on the pockets-they are HUGE and stick out quite a bit. If you don’t like attention brought to your hips, I’d steer clear. Despite all the weird fit issues, I loved this. The details were absolutely beautiful. If serious alterations weren’t needed for this piece, I’d snatch it up in a heartbeat.","18-Feb-2020"

It was fitted but not too tight in the bum and the waist was also nice and fitted (such a relief for those of us who deal with waist gaping). There is plenty of stretch in the skirt and it is much more versatile than I would have imagined.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/we-dissolve-acid-wash-skinny-jeans?color=092","boldpath","Fun retro pants","These pants were super fun. I really loved the acid wash, seams, and waist buttons. I lost about 50 pounds recently, so I’m really lost when it comes to sizing and ordered a US 10, based on reviews that this ran small. Ultimately, this meant that these were really comfy and a bit baggy. I tended to wear them a bit more like street wear with sneakers and a baggy top tucked in. It was a fun look during shelter in place, but would look better smaller. I imagine that to get them tight on the legs, they’d feel really tight when sitting, but it might be worth it.","16-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/stripe-collar-puffer-coat?color=061","MoPeot","If you need a cute, very warm coat, look no further","I started my Nuuly service precisely because I needed a very heavy coat for a trip but not one to keep. Montreal was my destination and 10 degrees was what I was looking at. There were only 2 reviews through Nuuly but I happened to find more elsewhere so I chose it. Paired with a heat-tech (uniqlo) long john top and a thick sweater, I also got through Nuuly, I was perfectly warm. Not to mention the pockets are lined with a very soft and warm fabric that my last day I didn't even need gloves (it was around 20). I think it runs a bit big because I'm a small and wore it with a thick sweater but it doesn't LOOK big. One thing I'd mention is I wish you could synch it in the waist a bit but overall if you live in cold temps or going on a trip to cold temp, I highly recommend. It's basically a cute parka. It would be too hot and heavy for a more mild winter- 35+ probably. I basically paired it with leggings (fleece lined and a regular pair) with snow boots. I should also add that I'm 5'7 and it was the perfect length. Someone a bit shorter might feel like it's too big/long.","11-Feb-2020"

I was totally surprised by this so while I adored these features, it may not thrill the person looking for a classic black coat. It is an amazing shape with great structure. Super warm.

The shoulder puffs give it some flare so it doesn’t feel that ordinary and a size small was perfect for tucking into jeans. Highly recommend!","26-Feb-2020"

The collar is massive of course, but it looks nice bunched up, and has a slouchy, casual vibe. While soft, it definitely feels like that ""fake"" knit feel, and it captured every single hair and fiber in the world. I could see this pilling like crazy after more wears, so I didn't purchase. Just didn't seem like something that would last years, and that's what I want out of a sweater I'm going to buy. However, for a Nuuly? Absolutely add it to your next one!!","26-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tomas-wide-leg-jeans?color=092","KLeNell","Too tight, couldn't wear","I'm usually between a 27 or 28, and I got a 28 and it was too tight. Technically I could button it, but sitting would have been very uncomfortable, and definitely felt a denim camel toe creeping up even while standing. I was disappointed because I was so excited for these cute pants. If you want them, I would size up at least one full size.","2-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/high-rise-slim-straight-jeans4?color=093","JesiBean","Too small 😩","To be fair, I have big legs and a smaller waist, so typically a 26 would fit my waist but be tight in the legs. I should’ve sized up. But I didn’t and couldn’t even pull them over my hips.","24-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/high-rise-slim-straight-jeans4?color=093","ksmcgregor","Way too long","Fit so well through the waist and thighs, but omg they were at least four inches too long.","14-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/high-rise-slim-straight-jeans4?color=093","shapedupsam","Cute but uncomfortable","These have no zipper and button all the way up which I do not enjoy personally. I usually wear a 27 and I got a 28. They fit but were pretty snug. They're definitely high-waisted which I love and cute with pretty much anything, but they were not comfortable jeans.","13-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/high-rise-slim-straight-jeans4?color=093","AllieLA","Too small","I ordered a size 26 and couldn’t get these past my thighs. I’m usually between a 26-27 but would maybe even need a 28 in these. Pretty bummed because they seem to be adorable","4-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/quilted-patchwork-kimono?color=031","padthaiprincess","Beautiful but not the greatest color for my skin tone","I love this jacket because I'm a lover of quilts. It has a wonderful fit and is made very nicely. I wasnt crazy about the color on me and wish they sold it in another colorway. The sleeves are wide at the hand so I did have some trouble when trying to cook with this on but it looks cute when cuffing the sleeves too. This is a great item to throw on in the mornings and wore it a lot this month while social distancing.","12-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/quilted-patchwork-kimono?color=031","Tessa","Cute!","This is a great, unique piece! It's super soft and great for layering with jeans and a tee. I tied the belt around the back, so the front was left open. Ultimately this piece is one of the reasons I signed up for Nuuly—good for a couple wears but not something i would wear enough to justify the cost of a full purchase.","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/quilted-patchwork-kimono?color=031","Lisa","Perfect layering piece","I wore this with skinny jeans, fitted T and my Dr. Martens Jadon. The next day I wore them with Nike black joggers and wheat Timberlands. Seriously thinking about buying it.","24-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/frill-sleeve-trucker?color=050","KelseyM","Boxy but Fun jean jacket","I loved this jacket! it was a boxy fit, but worn with a tight turtleneck underneath it could still be flattering. Wore multiple times to work, dinner, and out with friends and got a ton of compliments. Very easy to throw on with blue or black jeans!","11-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/frill-sleeve-trucker?color=050","rbw214","Fun but not for me","The ruffles on the sleeves look a little different from the pictures! Not as controlled, and a little messy looking. I liked the color, but never found an outfit to wear this with.","6-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/frill-sleeve-trucker?color=050","artgirl","purple ruffle perfection","I love this jacket sooooo much! I am struggling with the idea of returning it!! Normally with jackets I tend to size up, they tend to run small and I have never tried on anything from this brand before. Good thing I did cause the XL fits perfect. It is so cute and true to color, ugh I love it so much, perfect for spring. I mostly wore it with jean and a tucked in shirt that went well with purple. Def reccommend!","1-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/frill-sleeve-trucker?color=050","Ffiore","Too boxy","I love oversized, but this was very unflattering. The color and ruffle details are unique, but the boxy fit throws this off. There’s no smaller size than xs.","29-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/frill-sleeve-trucker?color=050","LynnMarc","Super Cute - Runs Big in the Shoulders","I absolutely LOVED this twist on the denim jacket! It runs a little big though so it was too boxy to wear with certain things- particularly in the sleeves and shoulders. I could have easily sized down and still worn it over a long sleeves.","8-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beth-faux-fur-jacket?color=015","laurenh630","Eye catching!!","This was the perfect jacket to spice up ANY outfit.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beth-faux-fur-jacket?color=015","ktownfinds","perfect jacket for any occasion!","It's quite warm, yet making very edge look in this jacket.

I'm 6 months pregnant and wore it over a tight black top and low-rise maternity jeans. Got so many compliments and had fun wearing it to work. I thought I would wear it more over dresses but I didn't get to it this time around.","11-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ophelia-kimono-jacket?color=049","leegl","Staying home is easy","Rented this during COVID stay home mandates, it was my favorite pick! It does kind of look like a bathrobe on a Zoom call, but I love it so much I didn't care. A must if you love Captain Picard's off-duty style.","6-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ophelia-kimono-jacket?color=049","Sarahnyc","Beautiful Details","I loved the way the colors and patterns of the fabric were mixed together on this coat. It looked very well made, expensive and unique. I wore it with a black tank top underneath and black jeans. I think in colder weather it would look good with a turtleneck. I have an hourglass figure and used the sash to make the shape less boxy, but it isn't really meant to be a sexy or form-fitting top. It looked very sophisticated and I wish I had more opportunities to wear it.","1-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ophelia-kimono-jacket?color=049","birdforbeans","I love the idea","I wanted to make this work, but I just couldn't pull it off without it looking like a costume.","25-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ophelia-kimono-jacket?color=049","MeredithL","Beautiful","I LOVED this jacket. It was the perfect item to have during transitional weather since it was warm enough in the cold with a jersey turtleneck, but not too warm in the heat. Would have bought if it wasn’t so much $$$. Obsessed and trying to order another color in my next box.","17-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ophelia-kimono-jacket?color=049","irisle","Adorable!","I never thought I'd be into wearing a kimono (longer ones felt like a bathroom on my petite frame), but this one is SO great. Perfect length and just overall a really fun piece. FYI, the stripes are metallic (is that the word I'm looking for?) and add a little sparkle which I am not mad about.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ophelia-kimono-jacket?color=049","cmulligan","Cute kimono vibes","This jacket is so pretty and the subtle hints of metallic lurex made it extra special. I wore it tied with a plain tee underneath for that kimono look with black crop flare jeans and black doc martins. I liked that I could also wear it untied like a true jacket for a different look. It’s quilted but not too thick, so easy to layer underneath a heavier jacket for colder weather.","28-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ophelia-kimono-jacket?color=049","elenimccready","Chic style","I loved this jacket - I ended up wearing the tie as a belt through my jean loops and wore the kimono as an open style.","14-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ophelia-kimono-jacket?color=049","Shersher13","Not For Me","I tried, but I never felt comfortable in this. It felt boxy and I didn’t like the way it fit in the armpits. It’s quality material though. I think it just wasn’t for me.","12-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/teddy-bomber-jacket?color=030","_jjjjo_","Sad","1x fits like a 3x at least. Is not soft, feels cheap, but I guess that’s expected from polyester.","19-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/teddy-bomber-jacket?color=030","MeredithL","So cute","A great piece for early spring weather. Warm in the morning but not sweating when I left work. Definitely size down as it was very big in the shoulders.","17-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/teddy-bomber-jacket?color=030","Iamsmith","Cozy","This jacket was nice and warm - definitely ran large but that’s the look. I do think you could probably size down one size. This was fun and different to wear for a month! I will say the zipper is INTENSE because of the weight of the fabric beware skin or hair around it!","1-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/teddy-bomber-jacket?color=030","fashionista2000","Warm bomber - kind of basic","Very warm bomber but in plus sizes, it looks less like a bomber shape and more like a basic sherpa fleece. Meh.","28-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/corduroy-puffer-coat?color=066","keb304","Love this cute pink puffer!","I got SO many compliments on this puffer coat, and wore it all the time - it's super comfy and while I usually wouldn't go for a pink coat, it's muted enough that it works well. I brought it on a ski trip for walking around the resort or heading to evening drinks, and good for walking around the city. It's warm enough for 30-40 degree weather, but would not recommend for any climate colder than that.","31-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/corduroy-puffer-coat?color=066","mkb92","Massive, but nice quality","This coat was pretty huge, but aren't all puffers kind of supposed to be? Even though I looked like a pink marshmallow, I still wore it and loved it because it's so cozy. The coat is pretty heavy and feels very substantial. Very warm and just overall feels like a very nice, quality jacket. It's getting warm here so there's no need for me to have it any longer, but it was just what I needed to get through the lingering cold days of spring.","26-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/corduroy-puffer-coat?color=066","happyhappy","Stay Puft Marshmallow Woman!","I thought this was going to be a cute, lighter weight, pink coat, but it was so puffy and heavy I felt like that kid in A Christmas Story. There was no way I could wear it. This is definitely not for in between weather - I would only get think about wearing this in 30 degree / freezing weather.","24-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/corduroy-puffer-coat?color=066","Akmajers","Very warm and fun","I loved this coat. I received many compliments. It is extremely warm, which is great for very cold days. I rented it close to spring so some days I over heated easily in this coat and had to take it off. Great midwinter coat!","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/corduroy-puffer-coat?color=066","Vic","Respect the puff","I could see myself living in this puff. Southern CA got a little too hot by the time it arrived though. This is a very warm jacket and I couldn't really get use out of it BUT I respect her pastel corduroy beauty and wish her the best life.","29-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/corduroy-puffer-coat?color=066","bananaanna","Super cute! A little big!","I LOVE this jacket. I got so many compliments every time I wore it. The only reason I give it 4/5 instead of 5/5 stars is that it was a little large on me. Otherwise, it was super warm and adorable.","24-Feb-2020"

The details on it make it so unique and you can tell it’s well made. Can’t rave about this jacket enough. Lightweight, perfect for spring. Definitely get this if you’re on the fence!","19-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sunshine-hooded-jacket?color=072","kellyashley","HUGE!","So this jacket is really cute but the yellow was much brighter in person than I expected. The material is soft and cozy so I may just wear this to lounge in the house but beware that the sizing runs huge! I got a medium and was still swimming in it.

There was nothing special about it, but it did fit true to size and I appreciated the neckline since most sweaters can be too restricting in the neck and bust.
