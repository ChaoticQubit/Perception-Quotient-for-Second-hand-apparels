"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tae-shrug?color=009","shannon0011","Not what I expected","I was really excited for this sweater because I thought it was an actual sweater! I was shocked when it arrived. I guess ""shrug"" didn't catch my eye LOL but by the looks of the photo, I assumed the black in the front was part of it! You need to wear a shirt under this and I just simply couldn't find one in my closet that looked great with it. Maybe if you have something in mind, you might have better luck than me!","23-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tae-shrug?color=009","Sofiamar","Super cute but NOT as pictured","This was my first Nuuly rental so I learned the hard way to READ THE REVIEWS! This is NOT a sweater, but a shrug, as the title states. I don't own a black turtleneck so I did not really have anything to wear this with. I might have enjoyed it more if i knew what I was getting myself into.","23-Mar-2020"

I only wore with black under and was a little disappointed that I couldn’t flip inside out (the seams/tag would’ve made it look bad) because I was very interested in going full zebra. Also FYI the sweater is quite thick and warm.","10-Mar-2020"

I wore it with jeans and heels once and then with shorts and flats another time. It was classy and comfortable but felt right for an important meeting. I'm sure there's more to be done with it, as I appreciate the flattering silhouette and can imagine it would also pair well with a skirt.","18-May-2020"

No need to be ironed or steamed, so I was able to stuff it in a backpack and pull it out for a quick change between events AND look effortlessly chic! I found it to run a bit large; I'm normally an 8 top and 10 bottom, but the 8 was looser than I'd like overall. Decided to try a 6 with my next Nuuly, which I expect to be a keeper!","11-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/henrietta-lace-tunic?color=011","mdlee","Pretty","Lots of compliments and I found the fabric very comfortable. The only reason I didn't buy the top was because the sleeves made it difficult to wear with a cardigan, but the cut-out lace made it too chilly to wear alone in the winter.","5-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/henrietta-lace-tunic?color=011","foodiemama","Beautiful and versatile","I loved this top. Sometimes lace tops are scratchy and feel fussy, but this one is not itchy at all and drapes beautifully. Very flattering, and great for dressing up or down. Fit is definitely oversized-- I'm usually a 2P, sometimes a 4P in tops due to bust size, and had lots of extra room. However, since the material isn't stiff and it drapes nicely, the oversized fit was okay.","4-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/raven-surplice-blouse?color=001","lbmo","Need a racerback bra","Pretty average top. Wore to work and it tucked in nicely to a skirt. Annoying though because I wore a regular bra and my bra straps were constantly showing in the back.","24-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/raven-surplice-blouse?color=001","Vlee","Great for work","Wore it with a long sleeve underneath, the cut on the neck is really unique and nice. Not great for bustier women, the bottom kind of tents out so you’d need to tuck the front in","24-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ingrid-wrap-blouse?color=009","ChrissyH","Big around the bust","I usually love wearing a wrap top or dress, but struggle to find something that suits a smaller bra size. A cute top & fabric but could not wear as it was too baggy over the bust.","14-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ingrid-wrap-blouse?color=009","soulfire32","Cute little wrap top","I really enjoyed this top despite it being too large. I almost bought it but I need to try on the smaller size. The wrap wasn’t tight enough for my liking as I am a tad smaller on the chest measurements. The fabric is dreamy and worked well for both work and a night out. I’ll try in the smaller size and determine if this will be a keeper. Fair warning: this top is a tad short and the neck line is a bit low for some.","4-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ingrid-wrap-blouse?color=009","ClaraG","Not great","I loved the look of this shirt on the middle but I found that it did not work if you have a larger chest. It’s very low cut and doesn’t have a button closure or anything to keep the wrap in place. Cute for someone else maybe!","1-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ingrid-wrap-blouse?color=009","jrdnnwlkr","Meh.","This top was cute for the first five minutes I wore it. Then I moved my arms around. It has no hook and eye or snap at the bust which is a HUGE oversight for Maeve. I am a 34D and wore a bust minimizing balconette bra and it shows a lot of bust. It rides up under the bust too. Kept having to pull it down over and over it was so frustrating. It just looked worse and worse as my day went on. Wouldn't recommend unless you're going to sit completely still and use a ton of double-sided tape to hold the neckline in place.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I took this on a long 2 week trip that was part business, part visiting friends and family, and part tradeshows- with different events/things to dress for plus 4 plane rides and 2 train rides through in. So this skirt is highly packable- I squeezed it into my suitcase every time and it didn't wrinkle for me! And it was versatile- I dressed it up with a leather and heels with a plain muscle tank and statement necklace for dinner and drinks out with clients, but also wore it with white Chucks and a graphic T for a casual backyard BBQ with friends. Got compliments on it every time.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The belt is definitely necessary as it’s somewhat baggy in the waist and the cut in the hips is pretty straight so a few months ago this probably would not have fit post partum.

If I rent again I will go up another size or 2. I have normal or even smaller ankles and calves and it was pretty tight around the bottom of legs. If you have large calves or legs it might be too tight. I wore it with white sneakers but it would look cute with a heel. There is elastic in the back over the butt that allows a little give on waist, but really no stretch and kinda hard to put your arms above your head.","18-Apr-2020"

This is actually THE reason I joined Nuuly - I wanted to buy it, but couldn't find it in store or online, and of course Nuuly had it! I ordered this in a size 6 because for some reason I always thought anthro jumpsuits run big, but I'm a little fluffier in winter/spring quarantine so its a little tight. My current measurements: 36/29/36, and I'm 5' 8"", around 155lbs. I usually wear a size 8 blouse, a size 27 jean but the 6 was a littttle too tight in my middle. Great for a spring summer jumpsuit, light fabric, though it wrinkles when you sit down...I paired this with a gorgeous rust wool coat I also got from Nuuly. LOVE the lined pockets and the shoulders and top fit great...just felt a little short/tight on the booty (gosh and I have no booty) short in the torso.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fiona-utility-jumpsuit?color=044","AnnieMEbee","Amazing Fabric, Unflattering Fit","This is the piece I was most hopeful about, and if it had fit, I would have worn it constantly. I’m a 29” true waist with a 38” hip measurement (at largest part of bum, as a tailor would measure “hip”), usually wear a size 27” pant or 2 or 4 dress, and the size small of this was very unforgiving south of the true waist area. In other words, I don’t consider myself curvy, but/so any amount of curve on a body makes the cut of these unflattering. Made for the thinnest type of frame.

Working from home, I rarely wear anything other than knits or jeans, but these are comfortable enough to wear anywhere, anytime. And the tie-dye is so subtle that it can be a neutral, almost a gentle camouflage look that's versatile, feminine and chic. I love these! I am usually a 14W but I took a chance on the 16W and while they're a little loose in the waist, they fit perfectly everywhere else. Definitely a win!","13-May-2020"

Had the butt area been a bit tighter, I think it would've been much more appealing, and the leg could've still been capris, etc. Maybe size down one on these jeans if you want a tighter fit?

Half way through my shift the pockets were hanging out of the sides that were now unsewn. These pants are super cool. BE SURE TO have plenty of room and maybe size up if you have thicker thighs. THe lining in the pants is stretchy and makes it feel like the velvet is too, but it is not. Lesson learned, still beautiful pants.","8-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/joplin-faux-fur-coat?color=030","Ophelia","What a coat!","It’s been a long time since I’ve gotten more compliments on a coat! It’s definitely a statement piece, so I’ve been styling it with black pants, black ankle boots and plain t-shirts a lot. (It’d also look great with a band shirt.) The fur is super soft, and it has kept me warm (and I’m always cold!) The sleeves on the medium are the right length on me! (I’m 5’5”.) I tried on a ton of faux fur coats this year and all of the sleeves hung to my fingertips. The large would have fit better in the body, but my shoulders are pretty narrow, and the medium fit just perfect there. (I usually size down in oversized coats, because of the narrow shoulder thing. The correct sizes have the tendency to create a David Byrne look. So, if this is you, ordering down might work for this one!)","29-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/the-power-of-women-ringer-tee?color=010","lavitacarlita","fantastic little tee w/ a vintage feel -- but make sure to size up!","this tee is super soft & truly feels like it's vintage (that's the stoned immaculate ethos, & they for sure live up to it with their tees). royal blue neck / sleeve details aren't uncomfortably tight the way they sometimes can be on ringer tees -- the material on those edges is actually surprisingly stretchy and doesn't clamp down on arms or neck awkwardly. only major advice I'd give if ordering this would be to size up a full size. I went with my usual M since that's all they had available at the time I was ordering my nuuly and while it fits okay enough to wear, this is clearly cut to be a fitted tee (not oversized or boyfriend style) so if you want a little extra wiggle room or a more relaxed vintage tee look overall, make sure to order up if you can!","11-Mar-2020"

That being said, I’m pretty tall so I imagine that this jumpsuit would be quite long on a human of average-height! I also have curvier hips and was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this piece, as I feel like it highlighted my curves in a great way. The color is definitely a brighter blue than pictured, but it’s a beautiful color nonetheless. I found it to be a bold piece, particularly the back, and am not sure that I’d rent it again... I couldn’t quite figure out where I’d want to wear it out to after we can, you know, actually go out and leave our houses again.

For the last several months this piece had popped up on my advertisements across social media because I kept clicking on it so when I found out I could try this out on Nuuly instead of spending a bunch of money and not knowing what I was going to get, I was so happy. Let me be clear- you need to be TALL and it better be all in the legs to wear this. It was so long I told my 6'5 boyfriend to try it on (he wouldn't lol). I would have to hem off like 5-6 inches to wear it :(","22-Jan-2020"

I’m usually an extra small, but I got nervous and ordered the medium. Definitely didn’t need to go that far up size. Small would have been good. It matches everything and is a perfect graphic tee for dressing down. Only complaint is the seam on one side was kind of crooked.

It's very cropped so it's best with very high-waisted jeans - like Ribcage high Levis for example. The V is pretty low, but not low enough to make it uncomfortable (I'm small-chested). A fuller bust would definitely be cleavage heavy in this top. The sequins are well made and do not itch at all. I wish I could own this top!","18-Mar-2020"

The perfect cropped length, super unique, and not *that* uncomfortable given that it's a somewhat tight sequin top. As someone who ranges between an XS and a S (I got a S in this top), AND not very busty, this top was on the verge of being too low for me but I made it work with fashion tape to keep my bra from popping out.","17-Mar-2020"

I ended up wearing it with pants, but I tried it on over a black slip dress, and that looked pretty good, if you order it and you need to make it more conservative for any occasions.","6-Feb-2020"

So an XL was perfect for my bottom half, but prob needed a L to fit the top half. Not sure if I’ll reorder a L though because I think it’ll be too small on my bottom half.

When I tried it on, it was really fun with a thick belt and long black blazer vest (whole lot of pattern happening on its own). Just never got around to wearing it when I had it. The material is a thin knit and the solid bands have a little sparkle to them if I remember correctly.","5-Feb-2020"

I thought the contrasting collar gave it a more elevated/expensive feel. The weather didn't cooperate, so I never wore it and I'm sad about it. The pattern is loud, so you have to be in the mood to make a statement. I find that lots of sweater dresses run small, but this might run slightly larger than other sweater dresses. Even so, if i did wear this I would have used shapewear.","28-Jan-2020"

It was wearable and didn't bother me too badly, but it did seem like they should have been cuffed or had elastic around the wrist to give it more shape.","4-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/to-the-moon-blouse?color=001","Bee","Meh","I loved the sweet, subtle print and the lightweight (but not sheer) material. However, the neckline and 90s cut really just gave me cult vibes in a bad way. It was loose enough to make it work when untucked with flare jeans for a more 70s look. But otherwise I basically spent a ton of time trying to style this with my work pants or ANY other cut of jeans and always looked somewhere between pajamas and costume. Quality was fine, but this style just did not work for my taste.","20-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/chloe-crop-pullover?color=000","Kaylarfrank","LOVED, Ended up Buying","Let me be clear, this is totally not something that I’d usually buy! I tend to stay away from wearing both lots of color and crop tops, but somehow fell so in love with this piece that I bought it!!! I wore it about a million times during the month, both inside and outside (on walks). It’s so comfy, and so cute! I’m usually between a M & L but went for a L with this one. I’m glad I went for the L just because it fits me a little bit more oversized then, and isn’t quite as short. If I had wanted it to be more cropped, I would have gone for (and probably have been happier with) the M. Also I just wanted to note that in this picture the sweatshirt is pictured as it looks when you first put it on. As you wear it, it tends to fall forward a bit and covers your tummy a little more (leaving your back a little more exposed). If you’re debating on adding this piece to your nuuly I’d say go for it, it’s comfy and cute, what else could you ask for right now?","25-Apr-2020"

I have thick legs but I'm still on the petite side, so I usually wear small pants/26 waist size and they fit me well. Sometimes pants are a little loose on my waist to fit well on my thighs, and these were a little loose on the waist and fit nicely on the thighs. However, they did not fit my calves and knees, like I could get them on but I just could not move in them and sitting was impossible without feeling like they were going to rip. They have zero stretch and for some reason were very tight in the knee and upper calf area, so I didn't even get to wear them at all, which was a shame because they looked cool. This probably won't be a problem for people with skinny legs, but unfortunately it was for me.","17-Jan-2020"

I loved the style of the coat and it was perfect for an outdoor winter event because I was able to layer up underneath but I had multiple people ask me if it was my boyfriends coat.","4-Feb-2020"

Definitely oversized to begin with, you can totally size down if you don’t like super baggy fits. (I like baggy fits and may even size down next time! <3 it","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I am pretty small framed so I even had my husband try it on and the xs size was even big on him! Made for a good laugh, but be warned it is very big.","20-Jan-2020"

Imagine sticking a leaf blower up your jacket...that’s what this looked like.","8-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tina-oversized-puffer-coat?color=011","M0n","It's Not A Coat It's An Experience","Urban Outfitters really did not water down this silhouette for the basic consumer. Winter chill making it hard to get out of your warm bed in the morning? Just step out in this king sized duvet with sleeves. The ""XS"" I rented is comfy on my 6', 185lb, broad-shouldered boyfriend (who loves wearing it too). I had a great time but if you are hesitant about wearing a whole cumulonimbus, size down 2-3 sizes.","3-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/good-as-gold-slip-dress?color=070","Janelle","Pretty and glamorous, a little unforgiving","Very pretty, glamorous dress with a nice weight to the fabric. In real life this dress comes off looking a lot closer to bronze/antique gold than it does the champagne gold in the photos here. Since this dress is shiny, it's a little unforgiving so highly suggest shapewear when you wear this to make any lumps or bumps a little less noticeable","3-Jan-2020"
