"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cashmere-coffee-date-cardigan?color=010","Blake","Nice. But not Wow.","I liked wearing this and the quality was great! It didn’t really ‘wow’ me from a fit standpoint. I wore it without an undershirt, buttoned up and my bra came out a bunch. When it was in place I loved it, but also didn’t enjoy checking my gals all day.","18-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cashmere-coffee-date-cardigan?color=010","minnie909","Decent Cold-weather Layer","I've wanted to try Naadam and thought this piece would be a good place to start. A lot of the reviews mentioned how soft it was, so I was excited. I found it to be a little itchy. I wore it layered over a long-sleeved top and that helped. It is extremely warm, and goes with practically everything, so it was a good layer. Ultimately I wouldn't get it again, it didn't really do anything for me shape-wise.","2-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cashmere-early-to-rise-sweater?color=003","Gemmajames","Cozy and casual","This was a great sweater to wear around the house on cold winter days. The fit was quite baggy so I felt very casual in this.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cashmere-early-to-rise-sweater?color=003","sramire8","Cute Cashmere","A great classic sweater for any outfit. I was able to dress it up for work (at the office) and wear it with a cute pair of jeans like the model. It runs large, I typically wear a medium in tops and ordered a small. I was glad to experience having cashmere, but dry cleaning was a pain. I only wore a handful of times and considered keeping it one more month!","14-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cashmere-early-to-rise-sweater?color=003","FVO","SOOO Soft","I would totally buy this but way too expensive. But I got my money's worth wearing it all month. So versatile and soft and warm. A little big. I should have gotten a small.","6-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cashmere-early-to-rise-sweater?color=003","GetEdgy","So soft","I love a good cashmere too amd this one fit the bill. I loved the longer bell sleeve and the slightly cropped style. I found myself reaching for this a few times as it was soft and super easy to style. Unlike the other review I didnt have any problen with pilling.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","stephlee11","Fun funky oversized button down","Loved this print and the oversized look. Size down if you want a more fitted look. I didn’t love the material, but it wasn’t bad. The tag says 100% silk but it didn’t really feel like silk. A button fell off the second time I wore it.","11-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","CAL","so fun, makes me want to go to Miami!~","I said true to size but it is an oversized shirt which I believe is how its intended to fit. I wore with a few things-jeans, shorts and leggings even. It is a statement piece and I wish I could've gone somewhere just as fun with it.","27-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","evschwar","Silky, colorful, baggy, and comfortable","Made for Miami! This colorful, oversized, silk shirt made me feel like Billie Eilish or MIA. I wore it tied up and cropped with high waisted jeans, pants, shorts, and skirts. Would work well with leggings or skinny jeans, too. It is quite oversized, though.","11-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","mdmenne","HUGE but cool fabric and pattern","I sized down in this shirt (expecting it to be oversized) but it was still too big. It could be super cute maybe with a bikini underneath but not for me.","27-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","kzimmyzim","Super fun vacation top","Loved wearing this as a bathing suit cover up and with shorts while I escaped winter and played in the sun.","5-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","Amandak","Billie Eilish vibes","My boyfriend told me that I looked like Billie Eilish in this shirt, and he wasn't wrong. I wore this to work with Cobalt blue mules and black pants and felt good about it","9-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","nicole_a","Baggy","A little too long and baggy for my liking. And things aren't usually long or baggy on me because I have a long torso and broad shoulders. Not as cute as it is on the model! Was really hoping I could pull it off but I couldn't.","6-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","brooklynromper","Fresh funk","I was obsessed w this but didn’t have an occasion. Yes it’s oversized but that’s the point. I’ll rent again in the summer for sure!","2-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","SquidStevens","S'Fun! But wish it came with sizing options","When I picked this shirt out I had an idea of how I wanted to style it in my head. When I actually received it I had to adjust because this top is VERY BIG. But if you work with it, it's very fun and you look like either Billie Eilish or a 90s rapper — in a fun way.","22-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","jmnarcik","I live for this fabric","I don't know what this shirt is made out of but I loved it. So thin but not see through? Amazing. I wore this to a festival and got soooo many compliments on it.","30-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","KJ","Made For Miami Buttondown","This top looked horrible on me. Too boxy. I very large busted so maybe that was the problem.","12-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/made-for-miami-buttondown?color=000","tundradweller","Beautiful 90's look but runs VERY VERY Large","I was so excited to get and wear this shirt. I reminds of shirts that I owned back in the day. However, it is HUGE. I wish that I had ordered a small. Unless you are 6 feet tall and weigh over 300 lbs., a large will be too big for you. So disappointed.","11-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","aforan","Loved this!","Perfect velvet blazer to dress things up. Would definitely recommend to those who have a longer torso and a normal blazer just doesn't seem right for some reason! Would have purchased if it wasn't so expensive, but great rental! Fits true to size - I ordered a Medium (2) as that's what I typically am in blazers.","30-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","run_tmc","Likely skip it!","I wanted to love this! Material is NOT structured, it is a loose, thin, lined velvet. Do to the lightweight, it doesn't hang well. I have a small frame, so shoulders fit me great, but it is intended for someone tall, perhaps with a small butt! Otherwise, this thin cardigan/blazer hangs all wrong!","24-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","Kmiller","Weird fit","The way the back pleats made me look large and round. May have been better on someone taller.","29-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","SportyType","Wanted it to work","This would be great but it’s too long and runs small","26-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","Shelly12","Weird","This is so cute but was oddly tight in the arms and big everywhere else. The collar also didnt stay down","19-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","Ceecee","Pretty but awkward","The blazer is very soft and luxurious, but the fit is very awkward. The sleeves are super long (not an issue I typically have!) and the shoulders are very tight (also not a problem I usually have!). I wore it to a wedding and it was a very nice layering piece when it got chilly, but was tough to really move around in.","13-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","Krivers","Awkward fit","The fit was overall a little weird. Definitely didn’t look great buttoned unfortunately. I just left it unbuttoned with jeans and a tee. I’m pretty petite so I had to cuff the sleeves. I’d say save your precious nuuly picks for somethin’ else.","16-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","Psychgirl","Great standout piece!","I got so many compliments each time I wore this blazer. The velvet is very soft and a bit more obvious in person. Easy to change the look by wearing open or buttoned. I wore open with a necktie blouse and skinny black pants. Felt like a chic rocker. Fit note: inner lining does not have stretch so can be a little tight on the arms.","12-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","Cece129","Shoulders Too Tight","Too tight in the shoulders. Could get it on. I don’t think sizing up would of worked.","2-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","Laura","Cute, but not in love.","I wanted to be obsessed with this blazer... the fit is a little awkward for a lack of a better word. So close, but not quite right.","29-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","Shaye","Nice","It didn’t close so was too small around but fit great in the shoulders","4-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-blazer?color=001","Mandicavanaugh","Not very comfortable","I am curvy so the fit didn't really work for me--this would be best on someone taller who has less curves.","30-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","emma1216","so cute and comfy, very high rise and got tons of compliments","pants are long so always wore with booties, looks great with any tight top!","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","Brumbe","Not made for curvy hips","Had a nice feel but I was unable to get around my hips even though they would have fit my waist.","15-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","Lanier","Too short but cute idea","At 5’9 with long legs it was too short to wear. I also should’ve gotten a medium bc the small was too tight on my hips, don’t think that would have given me enough length though. Would be cute for work if they were long enough though!","13-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","Sirena","I wish","I was trying to be optimistic with the size choice but figured a 2 would have fit better (there wasn’t a 2 in stock) - a bit tight at the 0 for my body.","29-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","MimiT","Nice but need to be taller than a basketball player!","I was so excited to get these pants, they fit fine around the waist but were too long to wear - even with heels! I lent them to a friend who is closer to 6ft and they swallowed her too. I'm 5'3"" and when my friend held them up to me they were the length of my body - head to toe! WOW.","11-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","Cynthia_Warshany","They were OK","Like the other reviews they were a bit large. I got the small and they fit around my waste perfectly fine and I was wearing high enough booties so they weren't dragging on the floor. But if bunched up weird in my stomach under the waste line (not too horribly) and just note they were extremely high wasted. Overall they were okay and I would rent them again if I needed to. But you just have to make sure you have the right shoes for these or you'll be stepping on them all night.","7-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","xoxoaen","A dream pant for tall folks","For someone who is 5'10'' with a 35"" inseam - these pants are PERFECT. I have a small waist and larger hips/thighs and the Large fits really well. I could have sized up to an XL to have it a little looser in the leg, but the waist would be way too big. If you are under 5'8'', these pants will definitely be too long. Maybe you could pin them, but that would mess up the beautiful drape. I own a black velvet blazer - so now my velvet suit dreams are coming true!","10-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","ashbarn113","Sooooo long","Too long to wear out of the house","8-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","Jsks","Cute but too big","I ordered a size medium but definitely should’ve gone with the small. However the length was a problem too. I have pretty long legs and I don’t usually have an issue with pants being too long but these dragged on the floor even with a high heel. Unfortunately I couldn’t wear them.","30-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","NuulyNewNew","Wanted them to work","I wanted these to work so badly, but they are super super long and waist ran very large. I’m 5’5” and these were easily 6” too long. Could have gone down 2 sizes in waist.","15-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dinner-party-wide-leg-pants?color=001","Rose","Very Loose","I should've realized the velvet material would be a looser fit pant but the way they fit on the model was deceiving. These run large and are not form fitting at all.","15-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","LadyLongandthin","Solid choice","I haven't ever really worn boyfriend jeans and didn't really know what to expect. The jeans had a good rise and fit well at the waist, but felt baggy and unflattering to the butt. Maybe that's the style. It is such a classic denim finish though I ended up wearing them a ton.","23-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","MarieFleurae","Odd fit. The zipper was slightly crooked.","I wanted to like these jeans. The fit is more of a loose boyfriend fit, but the zipper was slightly crooked, like they were poorly sewn. I rolled them up and wore them with a belt to hide the lopsidedness, but I kept trying to adjust the front to not look sideways. Maybe it was just this pair?","21-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","haybales","LOVEEEE these jeans!","I wore these jeans practically everyday, I loved them so much. They're soft, stretchy, and incredibly comfortable. They only recommendation I would make is down-sizing one size if you want them to have a more form-fitting/tighter fit.","9-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","Momlife","Looser than expected","The jeans were a bit looser then I prefer. Nice denim though.","5-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","Queenkim","Weird fit","I got my normal size and they fit in the hips but we’re slightly big in the waist and really big in the lower legs. They were mid rise, big high rise and the fit was just odd.","29-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","KtBB","Not slim","I expected these to be a little more fitted than a boyfriend cut but they’re so loose. Not comfortable. They just looked frumpy in a bad way.","9-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","Amcg83","Mid Rise","The quality was ok and the sizing was ok, I just didn't like the rise of the jean, I'd have liked it to be a little higher, but there weren't a lot of high rise options available at the time","7-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","doney86","Hard pass on these","Maybe I just ordered a size or two too big but these were just NOT flattering. I tried wearing them a couple of times and just couldn't leave the house in them, they were that awful. AND they did indeed smell funny like another reviewer mentioned ... like mothballs. Yuck.","2-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","kerrimae","Great Jean Option","I love these jeans. They're comfy, not too baggy, but not tight. I wore them again and again.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","mdub","Amazing Jeans","I loved these jeans and wore them a couple times a week! They fit really well through the mid thigh and have a straight/relaxed fit from there down. The Jean was thick and forgiving but not too stretchy. I typically wear a 26 in skinny jeans and 25 in boyfriend and these jeans were right in line with my expectations. I highly recommend them if you’re looking for a relaxed jean.","27-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","cm0nster","Nothing Special","These fit me more like a bootcut and less like a boyfriend jean. Like another reviewer, renting these for a month help me realize I really do prefer high-waisted pants.","14-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans3?color=093","SP","Not my thing","I should have read the description before giving these a go! These jeans are straight and boot cut. They were too long in the legs. I may have been ale to pull off wearing them with my cowboy boots but it was still too hot in Florida for that. They were not flattering when cuffs are rolled.","21-Oct-2019"

This dress is light and comfortable and looks highly professional in a meeting. It also boasts pockets, a loose waist (did I mention comfy?) and the ability to cinch it in if you want.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/abstract-shirtdress?color=095","MKA","Loved this dress, size down","Bold pattern but the neutral colors made it more muted. I would have worn it more but it fit too loosely on me, would rent again in a medium.","20-Mar-2020"

I wore with flats and a more fitted cardigan, and also with a flowy cardi and tall boots. It paired well with black or brown, boots or flats. The only problem I had was sizing. I ordered XL P, and it felt odd for me in the cut of the sleeves and bust. However, the regular size would have been too, too long. I probably would order size down next time, but keep it petite.","20-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/abstract-shirtdress?color=095","deedles","Fun pattern, compliments","I really liked the print and color. Has a retro feel. Agree with other reviews that this is baggy. I’m small and this picture makes my hips look huge. Cinching the waist as much as possible helps, but It’s still loser in the top and neck. Not a structured shirt dress. I enjoyed throwing this on to wear to work with booties or knee high boots and tights. I think it looked better when I wore a 3/4 sleeve navy Sweater blazer. Other downside was the fabric wrinkled very easily. The pattern helped to hide this.","13-Feb-2020"

The colors and pattern are unique and vibrant without being overwhelming on a petite frame. I hesitated on ordering the xsp, but I needn't have worried. The dress is oversized and can be tightened to your liking with the adjustable belt. I will say, although larger size would have been much too big on me, the sleeves were a tiny bit tight. They pinched below my elbows when buttoned, but I stopped noticing after awhile and, if I hadn't, I could have unbuttoned them. All in all, a beautiful, versatile dress that works for dinner or the office and boasts the added bonus of pockets. I'll buy it if/when it goes on sale.","22-Sep-2019"

I teach, so I didn't wear it to school for that reason, but I just wore it out to dinner a couple of times.

I wear a 12/14 and found that it was a tad too small in the bust (buttons had a gap) and the tummy area was not forgiving. I needed an inch or two in the bust and a few more in the tummy area to work on my mom-tum. Very cute, but be aware of the fabric!","22-Nov-2019"

It fits very tight and is impossible to ""spin around"" once zipped. Also, if you are at all curvy, I don't think this will work. It is a column dress and has no give.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/stella-skinny-jeans?color=040","foxfire","Nice fir, but hard to make knee-holes look good","Does anyone else struggle with jeans that have cut-out holes in the areas that these jeans do? I feel like a lot of women's bodies (or mine at least) have a sort of awkward fat deposit just above the knee, which's where these holes hit, thus making a little bulgy bubble pop up into the hole and it's hard to make that look classy. I found that pulling them up to disguise the holes being there at all worked. Honestly I didn't wear them because I got them three days prior to the stay-at-home order where I live, and they were too tight to be a cozy at home pair of pants, but would've looked cute if I'd gone out in them.","14-Apr-2020"

I'm 5'10', and the length were perfect on me (hit right at the ankle). They also fit the rear/hips area OK - the waist gapped slightly, but since they're high-waisted that wasn't too much of an issue. I usually get a 27 or a 28.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/stella-skinny-jeans?color=001","foxfire","Nice fir, but hard to make knee-holes look good","Does anyone else struggle with jeans that have cut-out holes in the areas that these jeans do? I feel like a lot of women's bodies (or mine at least) have a sort of awkward fat deposit just above the knee, which's where these holes hit, thus making a little bulgy bubble pop up into the hole and it's hard to make that look classy. I found that pulling them up to disguise the holes being there at all worked. Honestly I didn't wear them because I got them three days prior to the stay-at-home order where I live, and they were too tight to be a cozy at home pair of pants, but would've looked cute if I'd gone out in them.","14-Apr-2020"

I would have bought it except that the fit was off. I have a curvier lower half, and so I went in knowing that a satin slip skirt could be a challenge and I was right... Was a little tight around the rear and noticeably loose around the waist. I could even fold the waistband over if I wanted! So I had to wear it with shirts drapped over the waistband to hide the sag. Also it's definitely see-through, plan to wear some skin-colored underwear with it. But, all things considered, I did really like the skirt and would rent again!","17-Oct-2019"

The fit is pretty generous and as a 34D, was def large enough in the bust for me. I'm 5'8 and it was almost too long for me, so would not recommend for someone on the shorter side. The only thing I didn't like is that because the fabric has lurex in it (to give it the shine) the ties were scratchy on my neck. If I owned the garment, I would probably ditch the top and just wear it like a skirt (which is very easy to do). As it's winter I paired it with a soft pink sweater and paraded around my house for a while in it for kicks. It's really beautiful and feminine and would be perfect for someone who is tall in need of the perfect formal summer dress.","21-Feb-2020"

I usually wear a small and XS in some brands as I have a small chest, but for this top I should have ordered a size M or Lg. The material isn’t forgiving and there is a zipper back, so you can’t really wiggle your way into this one. Another observation is the sleeves are puffier than I’d normally have picked.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/eileen-off-the-shoulder-blouse?color=000","LouBlueChai","Beautiful, but a weird, slapped together fit","I thought this shirt was so fun and trendy, but I was never actually able to wear it. The fit is all over the place with this one. I ordered a small and the shirt fit me in the bodice/chest area, but the sleeves were EXTREMELY TIGHT. I couldn't even pull them up to my shoulders like it's shown on the model without being in intense pain. There are little strings that hang from the sleeves and the ruching in the middle, but these are mainly cosmetics and don't actually adjust the fit of the top. On top of this, the top was weirdly pretty long (went over the button/zipper part of my mom jeans) and just fit really big and odd in that area. Perhaps this fits better for people who are a bit more tall and narrow like the model.","7-Nov-2019"

Looking at this dress online I never thought I would like let alone LOVE how I looked in this dress. I do not usually wear tight dresses that show alot of leg/back/etc., but it was so gorgeous and unique I had to give it a try. I wore it out in Vegas and it was so comfortable! The fabric is pretty light and breezy and not bodycon/shaping at all, so it worked well with spanx underneath (except they have to be short enough to not poke through the leg slit). The dress definitely wrinkles so you may wish to steam/iron it. The high leg detail is SO sexy. It looks adjustable but it's not; the fabric is ruched up with a string ribbon. I am 5' 6'' and the slit was juuuuuust a touch too short for me, but that's also due to my preference. The sheer sleeves are really cute too. The back is basically a big tie so be wary about the bra/no bra dilemma as your back bra strap will most likely show.","7-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/molly-midi-dress?color=001","Nms","Unique dress","Was a little big at the waist, I’m usually a size 2 but the open back with ties allowed me to make it more snug at the waist. Wore to Friendsgiving and it was a total hit. This dress is so much fun. I usually wear minis but the open back and high slit keep this just sexy enough.

I'm usually between a S and M so I ordered the M because I know this brand runs a little small. It actually fit more like a true M but the back is a functional tie so I cinched it in as tight as I needed to for a snug fit. The cinch at on the side of the skirt is also adjustable so you can show as much leg as you like!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The arms fit a little small in the shoulders (mine can be broad) but nothing to write it off on. I loved the way the dress moved when I walked!","3-Dec-2019"

I wore this dress out to eat for my friends birthday. I found that the sleeve of the dress are a bit tight, I could not pull my sleeves up past the half way point between my wrist and my elbow. Also if you are flat chested like me, you will find it to be roomy and a little bit more poofy (not really saggy) in the front. Sadly, it was freezing the day I wore it and could only find photos of my turtleneck and jacket over it so I did not get a proper picture of the dress on.","9-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lacy-black-cutout-slip-dress?color=001","eaparkerrr","Subtly sexy totally chic","I ordered this dress in a size XS & S since I needed it for a wedding and didn't want to risk getting the wrong size for me. I marked this as true to size because I ended up going with the XS, which is the size I've been wearing more frequently and was the size that looked the best on my body, but boy was it hilarious actually trying both of these dresses on. The waistband is SO TIGHT, regardless of what size you get, and the fabric is double-layered, so trying to get both layers and the band over my chest was a dance. Once on and situated, the waistband stretches out a bit to where it's comfortable and dress keeps you hugged in all night. My favorite part was the peekaboo slit under the chest and I also loved the small bit of lace at the bottom that the under layer didn't hit. It gave the dress a hint of sexy but totally wedding appropriate.","13-Nov-2019"

The material is kinda like a thin flannel, which was different than I was expecting but it made it VERY warm, perfect winter dress with brown tights and brown booties. Could dress it up or down. The sleeves have snaps instead of actual button holes, and they come apart with little resistance so that might be annoying if you were moving around a lot in the dress, but it didn't bother me.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/canyon-cotton-dress?color=000","JenC","Pretty pattern, terrible fit.","This dress is very pretty and actually fit me ok because I sized down and paid attention to the review that said it was enormous. I got a medium and it fit me ok. I actually did not have the same issue with it that the other ladies on here report with shapelessness. It was form fitting on me, but then again I am pretty curvy. The problem for me was in the sleeves. They looked absolutely ridiculous on me and my petite 5'4"" frame and with the thick fabric they definitely gave a really bad Elizabethan look. They were impossible to hide under any blazer or sweater and thus, I could not wear this.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/canyon-cotton-dress?color=000","Arren","Shakespearean and shapeless","I really like how this dress fits the model but did not realize that it’s not the same shape in person because the model is holding up corners of the dress or it’s pinned in the back in the sample photos. In person, it’s very large and not form-fitting, and the sleeves look Shakespearean. It could look okay under a large coat that covers most of it because it has a cute pattern, but I’m disappointed in the general formlessness of it.","4-Oct-2019"

They are comfortable and hold a nice shape. I am 5'5"" so these were okay for me to wear with flats based on where the bottom of the jean hit my leg, but looked a little odd with heeled shoes and booties.

I rented these for 2 months in a row because I enjoyed them so much the first time and ended up buying them this time around since I knew I'd just continue renting them every month otherwise!

It is SUPER soft and comfy to wear. I think if I were a thinner, less curvy person, I would have worn it as is. However, with my curves it looked a bit too potato sacky on me. I threw a vintage belt on it with black tights and booties, and it was a cute option for client meetings. I was trying to decide between a large and medium - glad I went with the large as I think the medium would have been too snug on my hips (fits like a shift dress - straight up and down).","11-Mar-2020"

Thankfully Nuuly quickly found the missing sash and delivered it to my home in time for the event. This was such a figure flattering dress, I'd wear it a million times. I am sure this looks great on all sizes, but as someone with curves it was a hit. I will say that I got the zipper up with NO room to spare and I'm probably a C-cup.","11-Nov-2019"

If you have less of a booty, this will probably fit you just fine and be of a more appropriate length.

My only two issues I had was 1.) this designers items always run small so I sized up to bridal sizes (2 sizes bigger than my normal size) so my item would fit which it did. 2.) The section around the belly is a little baggy and pleated - I wasn't a big fan of how it laid on me which is one of the reasons I didn't wear it. So forewarning if you have a bit of a belly and you don't want it accentuated.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

If I had received a larger size, it would have been way too big up top. If your bottom has any curve to it, I recommend going up a size. The colors are fabulous though.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/new-york-minute-mini?color=080","M0n","Unreasonably cool","I wore this to a holiday party and got a lot of compliments. It fit almost like a glove and was really cute! I have narrow shoulders, and I would absolutely not recommend this for a person with wider shoulders. This is made of nonstretch fabrics; I really had to shimmy into it. The only slight fit issue, also visible in the retail photo, is that the front bodice is a little too wide above the bust, even though I was filling out the bust and shoulders. Its fully lined and quite beautifully constructed. The large keyhole demands some kind of convertible bra. I love the color story and wacky fabric combo. I’d be so thrilled to see more Kim Shui & similar indie designers available on Nuuly.","26-Nov-2019"

The zipper only opens a couple of inches at the bottom and then it is just a zipper over the regular jeans ... so you do not run the risk of performing some sort of Magic Mike routine by accidentally unzipping. The frayed hem is subtle enough to still be work appropriate. They are great jeans and I can definitely recommend them to anyone with a more hourglass figure.","6-Dec-2019"

I adored it and considered buying it - might still at a later date. With that said, I do have some disclaimers. The fabric is silk which makes it flutter beautifully but ended up also being basically see through even with nude underwear. Definitely needs ot be worn with a slip. It's also VERY long. I wore my highest platforms and it still drug a tad. I also recommend sizing down. I should've gone for a size 0 and I'm a solid athletic 135. One last note on the fabric, it wrinkles.

I should have just stuck with a small, because the size I got made it look a little too baggy on me. I still was able to wear it, especially tucked into dress pants and jeans, but it made me look larger than I am.

I have short arms and the sleeves were a little too long, but passable. Overall I was able to wear it just fine by tucking it into pants in order to cinch the waist.

I definitely should have gone with my top size. The medium was much looser on top for me than on the model and I wished it was tighter.

However, I sized down as other reviewers said, and the blazer was way too small in the shoulders, and looked ridiculously small if i actually tried to close the button, not oversized like it does on the model. I am a 4/S on top, and the S in this was too small. I don't have a large bust and don't consider myself broad, but in this case I really wouldn't size down unless you have very narrow shoulders.

I knew of this brand before order and honestly can't afford to buy their pieces outright, but now that I've worn one of them for a day I can see why their stuff merits the price because every little details feels super luxe and lovingly imagined. would wear this again in a heartbeat -- in fact, I'm actually kind of kicking myself for not adding this item to my December nuuly because it would be such a great foundation for a glorious holiday party outfit!","25-Nov-2019"

The other time, I wore it with a black dress and strappy heels and that was definitely my favorite way to rock it! Sizing - I was initially worried because I usually like my blazers over-sized a bit, and it was only available in an XS ( I would have ordered a small/medium if possible ). I was actually surprised that it fit me perfectly and even had a little bit of room. This leads me to believe that it could be just a little bit larger per size, which is perfect.","30-Oct-2019"

I am 5'10"" and ordered the small and I could barely get the sleeves up and over my shoulders- the length of the torso was so short.

The belt is definitely at the right place to make it look flattering. It goes a little tight for me vertically but it’s understandable because I have a longer than average waist. It goes on a little tight when you try it on but it loosens up really quickly. Only downside is that the fabric is a little rough and itches me, not the most comfortable to wear.","13-Sep-2019"

I rented it as an easy piece to take to my sister's bach party in Fort Lauderdale, but I ended up being able to wear it much more than I expected throughout the month! One thing to note - it is definitely a more green-based cheetah print than a brown-based cheetah print like it appears in the photos. It's sort of an iridescent fabric, so I'm sure the lights from the studio pick up more of the brown. Even the pictures I tried to take of it appearing green looked more brown!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruffled-mansard-blouse?color=069","Kindel","Bright and fun","A fun top to wear to work or out for the evening, loved the bright colors and ruffles.

The shirt is super soft, has the right amount of stretch. It IS short though and unless you want skin showing, must be worn with high waisted jeans. I ordered a M (I'm usually a S or M) and it fits well but not curve hugging. For a sexier look I would try sizing down.","5-Mar-2020"

My only hesitation was the fabric; it was printed on a white stretch/jersey fabric (so white on the inside), and because of this you could see white underneath in some areas slightly. It also has sort of a brushed/pilled appearance that isn't really pilling, probably from washing. I'm not sure how it's laundered in between wears at Nuuly, but just something to be aware of.

It's a thin cotton material so it was perfect for fall layering. I loved mixing other prints with this top as well. The petite small fit really well but if I wasn't wearing something high-waisted the shirt wouldn't stay tucked in so consider that when picking out your size.","23-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=070","Halester80","Fun, easy to wear top","I like this top a lot. It’s slightly boxy, so you have to size up because it’s short in the torso. I think if it was a couple inches longer I might have worn my normal medium, as the armpits and sleeves were looser than I like. Due to this it’s not great for layering with fitted pieces, but works good alone or with looser outer layers.","20-Oct-2019"

The shirt is super soft, has the right amount of stretch. It IS short though and unless you want skin showing, must be worn with high waisted jeans. I ordered a M (I'm usually a S or M) and it fits well but not curve hugging. For a sexier look I would try sizing down.","5-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=009","LindseyD","Cute print, weird fit","Loved the print and colors, but the fit was really off. The busy and shoulders were pretty large and the middle was more fitted true to size, so it kept bunching up at the neck and shoulders. Hard to explain but the fit was just really poor.","29-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=009","MJ","Adds a little whimsy","I’m usually an XS P but this was only available in XXS P. I wanted a more fitted look than shown on the model so it worked out well. This shirt is like a grown up version of something my toddler has—which is amazing because I am always jealous of her clothes and wished they came in my size!","27-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=009","afexlorbes","The Print is Everything","I wore this so much, I decided I needed to keep it. My only hesitation was the fabric; it was printed on a white stretch/jersey fabric (so white on the inside), and because of this you could see white underneath in some areas slightly. It also has sort of a brushed/pilled appearance that isn't really pilling, probably from washing. I'm not sure how it's laundered in between wears at Nuuly, but just something to be aware of. I'll be hand washing mine just in case!","26-Nov-2019"

It's a bit shorter than I expected (I have a long torso) but even with the slightest of crops it's super cute. Really like the mockneck length because a full turtle irritates my neck. This one is staying in my closet :)","22-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=009","katybuckster","too short","I have a standard sized torso and this is short on me, therefore not very flattering as that is where I carry my extra lbs.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=009","Hanna","Cute for work","I ordered a size up because I don't like turtlenecks that are too tight at the neck/boobs (also my normal size wasn't available, lol) and the top worked in a looser fit. It was a good top for work because it's a comfortable cotton and a fun pattern.","12-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=009","Tigertail25","Adore this Top","I received so many compliments every time I wore this top.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=009","Bryal","Nice & fun","I did like this turtleneck, though the one I received seemed like it’d been borrowed a few too many times—was a bit faded and not as sharp as I imagine it once was. I sized up as some suggested the top ran small, and while the large fit in a flattering way, I think I could have sized down to a small or medium and it would’ve been fine.","5-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=009","itsmecaseymc","Love Love Love This Shirt","Honestly I thought this might be too twee because of the print, but it really works. The mock neck style elevates it, and the fit is super comfy. It's also long enough to wear tucked or untucked which was a delightful surprise! I got so many compliments on this shirt I almost kept it.","24-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=009","Deeps","Cute for layering!","I loved this top. I saw it in store and was surprised it was available to rent so I jumped on it to see if it was something I would wear often. I became obsessed with this top. It's a thin cotton material so it was perfect for fall layering. I loved mixing other prints with this top as well. The petite small fit really well but if I wasn't wearing something high-waisted the shirt wouldn't stay tucked in so consider that when picking out your size.","23-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/printed-knit-turtleneck?color=009","Halester80","Fun, easy to wear top","I like this top a lot. It’s slightly boxy, so you have to size up because it’s short in the torso. I think if it was a couple inches longer I might have worn my normal medium, as the armpits and sleeves were looser than I like. Due to this it’s not great for layering with fitted pieces, but works good alone or with looser outer layers.","20-Oct-2019"
