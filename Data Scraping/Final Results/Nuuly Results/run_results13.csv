"https://www.nuuly.com/products/plaid-pullover?color=000","Marlee","Cozy and Fun","This was super fun and cozy. I was able to style it for a casual day at work, a dinner out, and just lounging. My only issue is this: it sheds sweater fibers, as it's a fairly loose knit. Keep in mind when you're wearing with dark fabrics.","28-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/plaid-pullover?color=000","Sarch","Cozy, oversized sweater","I loved this sweater! It has an oversized look which was perfect for lounging in but also wanting to look cute. I normally wear a small in a sweater so the XS/S was the perfect size. The only issue is the threads in the sweater shed and I ended up finding colorful strings in random places. 100% would recommend!","17-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/plaid-pullover?color=000","J-Ham","Absolutely love it","Great sweater (and perfect to rent considering the price tag). It's interesting, but not so ""interesting"" that it became difficult to wear. It was a very flattering fit, but might run a bit large. I'm typically a medium and went with the xs/s and was happy with that choice.","23-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/plaid-pullover?color=000","IslandDweller","So many compliments! Amazing fabric.","This sweater is amazing. It was a bit oversized, but I believe that is the style and I like it like that. Length of sleeves were perfect. I wore it to work with a collared shirt underneath. The layered look was super cute, similar to the model. Looks great as a casual sweater with jeans too.","30-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","Kmiller","Cute but a bit short","I loved the idea of this top but it fall a bit short... the top is a little too short to tuck into jeans without it coming untucked when you move, and then a bit boxy when it’s not tucked in. I still wore it though and liked it but not enough to keep.","20-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","HRae","Strange heavy fabric","I really love the colors and pattern of this shirt and wanted to style it like the model but the fabric is super dense and does not bend or fold into jeans well at all. It reminded me of curtain fabric or what you would upholster a sofa. It was also way too long for me to wear it untucked since I’m short (5’3”).","11-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","mrscorytee","Awful fabric","The colors and print are really cute, but this top arrived so wrinkled that it is completely unwearable.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","MarieCampbell","Cute with a front tuck","I was able to wear this a few times throughout the month - out to dinner and to work.

Between the fabric, stripes, and collar, I could have ran the bowling alley. Lol. I still enjoyed this top, however I wouldn't recommend it if you are over 5' 7"" and plan to tuck it into your jeans... it was sooo hard to keep tucked into my high waisted jeans all day! It's super wide and very short, but not a flattering enough shape that you can just leaving it hanging untucked. Looks great with SUPER high waisted black skinnies. Would be great for petite girls!","10-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","japrilcohen","Good in theory.","This was one of those items I wanted to love. I thought it would look great exactly as pictured (tucked into high wasted black jeans). But, the tuck in was challenging because it is kind of cropped & boxy. The half exposed pockets when tucked in felt odd. I didn't like how it fit when not tucked in. Tricky to wear!","5-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","annuu","Cute but not quite for me","I thought I would like this but just couldn't wear it. it seemed like a light flowy shirt but it was pretty heavy and somewhat structured. wasn't very comfortable and im all about cozy comfort in the winters","4-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","Emmylou","Love!!","This top was so cute! It is a boxy oversized fit— just like in the photos. I would size down if you are between sizes (I’m between a L and XL and the L fit just as shown). It also felt super well made, the fabric is thick and sturdy.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","Kimiko","LOVED it - perfect boxy cut","Wanted a boxy and oversized look, which often doesn’t work for me since I’m a bit shorter and have a bigger chest. However this shirt nailed it, draped in the right places, and was the perfect length for jeans. Definitely SIZE DOWN - I got a XS and it was perfect.","29-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","alexac28","Cute boxy top!","I really liked this top!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","breanna","Cute!","This top was fun and unusual! Love the colors in person. Unfortunately I never had the right occasion to wear it; with the low cut top and cropped fit I only would have wanted to wear it out on the town. The fabric was nice and thick, which felt high quality, but there is intricate pleating on the sleeves that kind of looked messy without being ironed perfectly.","12-Feb-2020"

It fits slightly oversized and hits right below the top of high rise denim. Paired with a casual black strappy sandal. My only complaint is that it got SUPER wrinkled in my luggage and sadly I didn't pack a steamer which would have solved my problem.","12-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","kmsimmo","Thick Fabric","I thought this shirt was going to be more of a thin silk-like fabric but its actually closer to a canvas which prevented the shirt from really having any movement like I thought it would.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vara-striped-boyfriend-shirt?color=067","rose_e","The material feels very good!","I ordered a medium, which I did due to being in between a small/medium and not wanting my items to be too small!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/isolda-blouse?color=011","KarenB","Nice Blouse","As other's have said, the fabric is heavy.

I’m seriously debating buying it, I love it so much, but it’s a little pricier than I would normally like for a top. However, the quality is impeccable. The fabric is substantial, yet still has a beautiful drape and a soft hand. The v-neck cut is perfect. The shade of green is a beautiful sage that goes well with light or dark denim. I’ve worn this multiple times with high-waisted jeans and gotten so many complements.","4-Mar-2020"

While fairly thick, I don't feel like it's too bulky. The colors are very pretty, the print not too loud - and this from someone who usually wears neutrals! I am usually between a L and XL on top, and this was a little oversized on me, just how I like my hoodies.

There is no way it would breathe at all in hot weather. I also found it all around too short for me—which isn't surprising since I'm 5'9"". The sleeves were 3/4 on me (which is usually fine, except these have elastic cuffs, and that looked a bit weird) and the length hit at a strange place on my shins.

I loved the front of this but didn’t realize the back was like a sweatshirt, which made it comfy but definitely less business casual. I wore it paired with a skirt but felt too casual with just jeans. Very comfy. Size down, I’m typically an XL, but the L fit me more than we’ll, back has a lot of stretch.","19-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/milanio-top?color=009","kricket","Funner in Theory","The pattern is fantastic and the material feels high quality. The back is a thin sweater and the front is a thicker satin. The difference in material means the back is heavier than the front, so I felt like it was always pulling the shirt backwards and against my neck. The front unfortunately wrinkles almost immediately upon putting it on. I did wear it several times though because its such a fun print.","12-Feb-2020"

I am typically between M and L and went with M, which fit fine but was the slightest bit snug in the shoulders.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/greta-tiered-maxi-skirt?color=009","cdillydally","Really pretty and versatile... with a few caveats","This skirt is SO pretty! I got compliments all day when I wore it to work. The fabric is super lightweight so it can be worn in any season - I wore it over leggings to work to stay warm in the winter. There are metallic threads throughout that dress the skirt up. I could definitely imagine wearing it to a wedding or event with a silky cami and heels. Caveat #1: the metallic threads have a tendency to shed... like EVERYWHERE. I left a trail of gold dust behind me everywhere I went. Caveat #2: I am usually between a 4 and 6 so I took a chance on this one and ordered a 4. The waist is elastic all the way around but it's not very strong elastic so it easily slips down to your hips. I recommend sizing down for a snug fit that's actually at your waist. Or you can belt it (that's what I did) to keep it in place!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The flowers on the side look like a lace and said and I got quite a few compliments to one time I wore it. I typically love high waisted jeans, but this one was really odd. It hit above my belly button but it was so high waisted and long in the rise, that I had to constantly pull it up or the crotch was hanging down between my legs lol. Odd. Otherwise it fit true to size and if the rise from your crotch to the waist band would be slightly lower, it would be perfect.","7-Feb-2020"

The green jacket is like a twill, so it doesn’t necessarily look like a winter jacket, but that fur entirely lines the inside, so it was extremely warm for February in Illinois. The fur is removable, tho I didn’t try that (since it wasn’t necessary) and it has black stars in the dark red fur, which I couldn’t tell from the picture. I am short and the sleeves were the right length on me, so I could see that being a problem for a taller person, and the waist clinchers weren’t very easy to use since one would have to knot the string (there was no adjustable piece).","10-Mar-2020"

The fur is soft, the fur lining comes down to mid-hip and has cute black stars on it. I’m definitely pear shaped and the cut of the coat is pretty straight, so I preferred it unzipped. The fur zips out, so the green layer can be worn alone, but the fur layer didn’t seem to be made to be worn alone. Also beware of tricky buttons if you do separate them!","2-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/furry-hood-parka?color=031","lolauren","A nice change of pace","This coat is cute and about a 7/10 for warmth. I live in Minnesota and it has been frigid lately, so take that into consideration. I would probably recommend this coat for temps around 30/40, because it honestly looks best when left open. The faux fur is inside and the hood lays best when unzipped. So its cute and fun to mix things up, but I would choose it for days where you're running around with it open, as it looks best that way.","21-Feb-2020"

Once when we were leaving to go out my boyfriend even joked, “Time to find out how much everyone loves your coat.” Seriously never wore it out of the house without people complimenting me or asking about it. The fit was perfect and on our coldest days it was easy to fit sweaters underneath without feeling overly bulky. Such a great style!","19-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/furry-hood-parka?color=031","KCS","Best Rental Yet","This is my favorite piece I've rented yet. I needed a coat for unpredictable weather as I was about to take a trip abroad, and boy am I glad I tossed this into my Nuuly at the last minute. When I was expecting rain, we got snow and hail - and this kept me warm throughout! I was worried about it not being waterproof, but it was plenty proof enough for my needs. The pockets were deep, too, so I could keep everything I needed in them (gloves, a camera, and phone!) without it distorting the fit. The snaps were perfectly placed so that I could just snap, rather than zipping, the coat, and the top one snaps in just the right spot that the faux fur is cozy against the neck, in case you forget your scarf. I love that the faux fur lining zips out if needed, though I kept it in the whole time, and the hood is so large that it doubled as a pillow on the plane for sleeping! I have very short arms, and the sleeves on this were perfect as well. I might just have to buy this one!","18-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/hoxton-twisted-seam-slim-straight-jeans?color=093","Kaylarfrank","Liked Not Loved (But Worth It Anyway)","I ordered a 31 in these jeans (I usually wear a 29 or 30), thinking that I’d rather them be too large than too small. When they arrived, while a little too big (especially since they stretch throughout the day, I should have went with a 29), I still fell in love with them. They were so soft and comfortable, as I have found to be the case with all Paige denim. For the most part I like to rent more trendy pieces of denim rather than purchase them, especially since it’s difficult for me to find really well-fitting, trendy jeans. I liked the color (although lighter than pictures) and the twisted/cut detail on the hem. However, these jeans were quite cropped on me (I’m 5’11 for reference), but I imagine they’d be perfect on normal-height people. Despite being imperfect for me, I still wore these jeans plenty of times throughout the month I had them and received plenty of compliments. I’d definitely recommend renting these jeans if you’re looking for a simple way to spice up your everyday uniform, just order them at your standard size 😊","16-Apr-2020"

Disappointing because overall they were great. Paige jeans are always comfy, they fit my waist and thighs well, and are structured but still soft. Usually I can get away with ordering regular length jeans and rolling them, so I figured this ankle style but be slightly too long-- I was wrong. They split just over my feet and the hem touches the floor when I have them on. The twisted hem and slit make it so that you can't really cuff them.

It has some very light seafoam green accents which you could bring out by pairing with brighter blues or greens. I ended up buying it.","5-Mar-2020"

I wore it on a trip in Africa and a cruise when I felt like being put together for dinner but without having to put much thought into my outfit. Looks better with heels/wedges but I wore it with sandals most times. Midi dresses and high-neck are not my go-to styles so this was basically outside my comfort zone.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fiona-knit-mock-neck-tunic?color=026","BellaVen","Great cut but unforgiving fabric","I really liked this dress and it would be an excellent easy outfit for work, but the length was a very awkward in-between.....too long to be mid-calf but too short to be full length, so it looked very ill-fitting for my height (5'3"".) The fabric is also clingy so this is not very forgiving around curves. Will look great on straight body types.","13-Nov-2019"

I should have known to wait for it, but it was my first rental and I was impatient. That being said, I was drowning in this dress. I could have definitely gone down a couple of sizes. The length was also off compared to the model and where I wanted it to land. I’m not terribly short, but I think if I wanted it to land at more of the midi length, I would need a petite. All in all, I wanted to love this dress, but couldn’t. I will have to try again with a different size.","11-Nov-2019"

The bottom hem really wanted to flip up, I ironed lightly but it did not want to stay! If it were warmed and I didn't need a jacket/cardigan, I think I may have worn more.","3-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fiona-knit-mock-neck-tunic?color=001","SaraMat","Versatile, Flattering, Comfortable","This is super comfortable, easy to dress up or down, and can easily be worn multiple times throughout your rental! I wore it on a trip in Africa and a cruise when I felt like being put together for dinner but without having to put much thought into my outfit. Looks better with heels/wedges but I wore it with sandals most times. Midi dresses and high-neck are not my go-to styles so this was basically outside my comfort zone. Had this been shorter or a full maxi I might have kept it but the midi is just not my favorite look. Best of all, the neck is not too tight and sometimes necks like this can drive me crazy!","27-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fiona-knit-mock-neck-tunic?color=001","BellaVen","Great cut but unforgiving fabric","I really liked this dress and it would be an excellent easy outfit for work, but the length was a very awkward in-between.....too long to be mid-calf but too short to be full length, so it looked very ill-fitting for my height (5'3"".) The fabric is also clingy so this is not very forgiving around curves. Will look great on straight body types.","13-Nov-2019"

I should have known to wait for it, but it was my first rental and I was impatient. That being said, I was drowning in this dress. I could have definitely gone down a couple of sizes. The length was also off compared to the model and where I wanted it to land. I’m not terribly short, but I think if I wanted it to land at more of the midi length, I would need a petite. All in all, I wanted to love this dress, but couldn’t. I will have to try again with a different size.","11-Nov-2019"

It looked awkward with a layer on top of it, but it was too cold to wear it without one. The fabric is heavier,, so when it was warmer, it felt too heavy to wear. Would be a good fall transition piece. So flattering. I loved it, but the weather wasn't right.","25-Oct-2019"

Was versatile enough to take me from business trip go-to to comfy, cozy 9-hour plane ride sweater. It is very oversized, even after sizing down to the XS but not in an unflattering way. I wore the heck out of this for over a month and it looked as good at the end as the day I got it. Fabric was very thick and not super breathable, so definitely a winter sweater, too thick for a transitional piece in my opinion.","9-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/easy-street-tunic?color=060","gertiegamer","I wore it, I like it, but you should know what you're getting","I wore this twice, but this sweater was not as expected. It is very large, I mean I love oversized sweaters they are sort of my fav, but this thing was next level big. The color was exciting, especially during the darkness of winter, but that is where the excitement sort of ends and the confusion begins. The ratio of fabric at the top of the sweater to that at the bottom is just a riddle. I think maybe if I was taller this might be a wee bit better...hrm...maybe paired with some black faux leather leggings and a high-boot...I don't know, I don't want to totally give up on this sweater, maybe you will come up with some cooler ideas of how to wear this. I mean, the color makes it worth a try. Please share any style wins as I'd be down to try this one again with some advice. So basically, worth a try just know what you're getting.","30-Dec-2019"

Compared to my coworker’s size XS sweater in the same style but different color they appeared to be the same size. There’s also the possibility it was mislabeled during manufacturing, which is rare but is something I have seen occur with URBN brand items occasionally. So basically, the medium I ordered ended up fitting smaller than expected but I still wear it all the time because it’s one of those perfectly soft and classic pieces that goes with absolutely everything.

It is very large, I mean I love oversized sweaters they are sort of my fav, but this thing was next level big. The color was exciting, especially during the darkness of winter, but that is where the excitement sort of ends and the confusion begins. The ratio of fabric at the top of the sweater to that at the bottom is just a riddle. I think maybe if I was taller this might be a wee bit better...hrm...maybe paired with some black faux leather leggings and a high-boot...I don't know, I don't want to totally give up on this sweater, maybe you will come up with some cooler ideas of how to wear this.

Compared to my coworker’s size XS sweater in the same style but different color they appeared to be the same size. There’s also the possibility it was mislabeled during manufacturing, which is rare but is something I have seen occur with URBN brand items occasionally. So basically, the medium I ordered ended up fitting smaller than expected but I still wear it all the time because it’s one of those perfectly soft and classic pieces that goes with absolutely everything. One of my favorite items from this month, will be reordering in a different color next time!","17-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/easy-street-tunic?color=016","Patrizia1441","Nice Summer Sweater","This was the last of my six items I picked and the color is what sold me because it is so fun, especially this time of year with a tan. I ordered it a size bigger because I wanted it to fit oversize, and the material is perfect for warm weather. I wore this inside the office were the AC is blasting all day and it kept me comfortable and cozy all day. I also got TONS of compliments for the color so it was a win!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
