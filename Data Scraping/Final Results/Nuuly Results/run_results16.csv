"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brinn-textured-sweater?color=053","Abracadabra","Great casual cozy sweater","Loved the color / texture and coziness. Fit was pretty good, not the longest in belly area if pregnant but worked for me at ~20 weeks.","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brinn-textured-sweater?color=053","kacie","HUGE","This sweater was huge and not in a oversized cute way. The neckline was so wide it kept falling off my shoulders, again not in a cute way.","6-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brinn-textured-sweater?color=053","stmd","Great","Loved this sweater! Expect it to be slightly oversized but not too much. I actually wish i sized up because i like my sweaters to have a lot of room, but it still looked great. It also felt great! There is a lot to love with this one.","5-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brinn-textured-sweater?color=053","mvekov","Not as nice as I thought it would be","Overall ok piece. The photo definitely makes it look nicer than it is. More of a casual sweater. I wore it a few times - but was not very impressed.","2-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brinn-textured-sweater?color=053","Finnsmom","Cute Basic Sweater","This sweater was cute. Good color, comfortable and not too heavy. It just wasn't anything special. I wore a medium and it still has the slightly over-sized look.","26-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brinn-textured-sweater?color=053","InAHandbasket","Looked so cute on the model!","I loved this on the model, but I felt frumpy in it. The knit is very thick, and I felt like it is made for a thinner body type than mine. Pity as it was very good quality.","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brinn-textured-sweater?color=053","amy123456","Cute but short","If you are okay with tops on the shorter side, you will like this sweater. Its very cute but showed my stomach often (I am okay with that but most people are not). Wore to dinner with friends","18-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brinn-textured-sweater?color=053","CStgelais","I loveddd it!","I know there were mixed reviews on this sweater but I loved it. It definitely is a little boxy on the hips so you just have to style it right. The large was nice because I wanted it to be oversized. Major points won for comfy level!","13-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brinn-textured-sweater?color=053","Butterfly123","Perfect weekend sweater","The sweater is perfect for pairing with jeans or a nice pair of dress pants. Very neutral to go with any color!","18-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brinn-textured-sweater?color=053","G","Another Winner","I didn't want this sweater to be as oversized as pictured so I sized down and ordered an XXS P instead of XS P and it exactly as I wanted. So happy with this sweater. Neckline is very flattering. By sizing down, the sleeves are 3/4 length on me which is perfect because I don't have to keep pushing them up all the time. Looks great with a skirt or with jeans. I'm loving everything in my order this month. I'm always so excited to zip open my suitcase when it arrives. Thank you, Nuuly.","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-turtleneck-sweater?color=090","LadyPinecone","Dreamy colors","Soft and lovely, but the neck was a bit large. I have a pretty long neck and this was a bit too long of a turtleneck. I wear turtlenecks almost daily and this one was one of the few that ever gave me that choking feeling.","29-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-turtleneck-sweater?color=090","baileyyoung516","Warm and beautiful!","Comfortable, warm, great colors! Unfortunately, I only got one wear out of it on vacation in NYC. I like in Texas, and it just wasn't cold enough to wear again at home. If you live in a cold area, you will enjoy this!! True to size, soft and cozy!","6-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-turtleneck-sweater?color=090","LonghornLady","Super cute sweater!","I liked this a lot. I wore it on a couple of those spring days when it was still cold. I'd like to keep it longer, but spring is short where I live and it's too hot.","6-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-turtleneck-sweater?color=090","BeccaEn","WAY too much neck","When i say this is the turtle neck.... this goes all the way up to your eyes. It was so thick around the neck i looked silly! Only wore once. Great rainbow color though.","28-Feb-2020"

Some how I felt a little silly wearing it. Also I found the neck a bit itchy. On the positive side, it fits nicely on the body. And it is bright and playful.","3-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-turtleneck-sweater?color=090","eao","Love this colorful sweater!","I love this sweater. It’s so bright and fun! It’s chunky/thick so it’s very warm and is also true to size. It is a bit tight around the neck, so if you like a more loose fit there then I would take that into consideration.","3-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","StephD","Cute Jacket","Cute jacket that I would have worn more, but it was too warm outside, and it was too large (didn’t have my normal size medium so I got a large). I would get again in my size and with cooler weather.","6-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","aldiob","Versatile overcoat","Would buy this if cheaper. Great, light coat that goes with a lot and dresses up an outfit a bit.","8-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","PilarAlfaro","Lots of Compliments","I have never worn a long blazer like this, but I love the look! I wore it with a gray hoodie to make it more casual. It was comfy and kept me warm during work and walks.","3-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","SJSNYD","LOVED IT","The perfect spring/fall jacket! Thin enough to wear all the time and be comfortable, but still keeps you warm. Didn't buy this time, but will probably rent again and buy. Immediately regretted sending it back.","23-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","Amancalada","Wore frequently but not perfect","I liked this a lot, but it was also just too big and probably looked a little ridiculous. The material was really nice and warm, and I think it would have been super cute had it been a little more form fitting. I ended up layering over other sweaters.","21-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","Smk23","Thin material","It was a very thin material. The picture makes it seem more structured and sturdy. I also found it difficult to style. A little cheap.","18-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","JLRizzy","Decent sweater blazer","Something about this felt a bit stuffy to me, but I liked the button pockets and how soft it was. Wore a few times, normally a size 8 in dresses and the large fit well with room for a longsleeve top underneath. Like, didn't love.","12-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","loveduff21","Glitter","I wore it to work often - there is a small amount of glitter in the fabric that you can't see from images that makes the product more fem without being overstated. I felt a little frumpy in the garment, though I had lots of compliments on it. I usually wore with jeans and a t-shirt to dress up my look.","3-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","tenillen","pretty cheaply made","Didn't love this jacket. In fact this is one of my least favorite items I've rented. It wasn't lined, was super thin. I did order a large thinking I would layer with sweaters but I wouldn't size up if I had to do it again. Super cute on the model but didn't love.","3-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","lucystrawberry","Sooo cute!","This runs large. On clothing lines that size small I am always a large or an extra large, but this was ALMOST too big on me. I wish I had gotten a size smaller, but I decided to go with it. The line is elegant and chic. I wish there were side slit pockets.","2-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","Martha","Cute, but not what I expected","It was cute when worn with the right outfit. The issue is that it's not really a blazer/coat. It's soft without structure, so it's more like a cardigan.","26-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","emilyz","Office Hours or Happy Hours","Love love love this blazer so much I decided to keep it. I got so many compliments. It runs true to size and can be dressed up or down. Super chic and not too heavy.","26-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","FeliciaR","Comfortable, Versatile","I wore this a lot. It elevates a t-shirt and jeans beautifully, plus it's very comfortable soft fabric. Almost bought it!","26-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","coelaine","Perfect work piece","The fabric is very soft and not super structured. I wasn't expecting that, but ended up really liking it. More of a mix between a cardigan and blazer.","4-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/graham-longline-plaid-blazer?color=005","NurseSteph","Great work to evening item","I always appreciate coats that are flattering on petite frame. Coat is slimming, has cozy, but thin-ish fabric, so not going to be helpful on super cold nights out. Wore this to the office with a cute scarf.","23-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sunshine-hooded-puffer?color=072","ech","Good quality","Unfortunately, this was a little too big for me. This is definitely great for transpositional weather, but since it's just been straight up cold, I found it hard to wear on it's own. Would be better in Spring or Fall.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sunshine-hooded-puffer?color=072","Hales","Super warm but super huge","I got this for a camping trip, and it was indeed quite warm, but it was huge. I usually wear a M/L and the L was way too big. I think the M would have still even been oversized, and the S might have actually ""fit"". The color isn't quite as vibrant as in the pic. Consolation for me was that you can sinch the waist a ton so that helped it not look like it belonged to my husband.","5-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sunshine-hooded-puffer?color=072","keckels","Bright!","I loved this item. It’s bright and warm. Sometimes I wasn’t sure if I should wear it as a jacket outside or a hoodie inside though.","31-Jan-2020"

I loved the warm and cozy corduroy, the vibrant color, and the awesome contrast on the belt. Only downsides to this is that it adds visual weight (very puffy), and the belt also sometimes is a bit awkward to tighten. The jacket is also pretty short, and doesn't look as great if it has a sweater or shirt sticking out of the bottom.","16-Mar-2020"

It went over bulky sweaters (though the cuffs are a little sinched), it was super warm against 30s and wind while still being cute. The color is true to the photo and I wore it with and without the belt, it’s was cute either way. My only initial bad thought was that the collar was too high, but if it’s turned down it looks good still. That being said, I wore a chunky turtle neck under it and the layering of the collars was very cute. Will rent again!","10-Feb-2020"

Slightly awkward length for a petite person, it’s a few inches too long so putting my hands in the pockets to keep warm felt off (kind of like instead of putting your hands on your hips, you put them 3-4 inches lower). Warning to my super hippy or pear shaped ladies- this will accentuate your lower half, especially when you put things in the pockets (i.e. phone, beanie, tissues). I’m pear shaped and definitely felt more bottom heavy but it’s a fun, different style that I love wearing for a month to mix up my winter coat/jacket game.","6-Feb-2020"

I've worn this in 33-ish-degree mixed-precipitation weather and was plenty warm, though I wonder how it will hold up against true near-zero temperatures. It's very stylish and fashion-forward, although the tie at the side is more of an inconvenience than I was anticipating and doesn't cinch quite as tight as I'd like. The green is a deep, rich green, something I love, and the sleeves were the perfect length for my shorter arms. The shape of it wasn't quite spot-on for my pear-shaped body, but I expected that. Nonetheless, although it wasn't quite as flattering on me as it was on the model, I still loved it enough to wear it more than once. Definitely worth renting just to have people ask where I got it!","15-Jan-2020"

Mostly wore it unzipped but buttoned, the ties are long and may drag if not tied. It was really cozy in 20-30 degree winter weather, for that I almost kept it.","5-Mar-2020"

It's SUPER warm, which was a huge plus for a rental coat in the middle of winter in the northeast. The cut is interesting and I felt really cool wearing this coat. My one complaint is that the fabric is very, very shiny, so it's really like wearing an avant-garde trash bag.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kanda-puffer?color=230","FeistyKage","Loved in theory","I was convinced I would buy this before I got it. First I should have sized down at least one size. I loved the details like a shawl collar that wrapped when buttoned and the knit cuffs to keep out wind. But the wear is so cumbersome! It has to be buttoned and tied otherwise the ties drag and it looks weird tied back around your back. Took it on a trip and I finally shoved it in my luggage so I didn’t have to deal with it through the airport. But it is a warm and fashion forward puffer. Would have been cuter in a smaller size on me.","8-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kanda-puffer?color=230","MeeshN","Unique Puffer, Awkward Length","Great puffer! Warm enough for 40 degree weather in NYC. Slightly awkward length for a petite person, it’s a few inches too long so putting my hands in the pockets to keep warm felt off (kind of like instead of putting your hands on your hips, you put them 3-4 inches lower). Warning to my super hippy or pear shaped ladies- this will accentuate your lower half, especially when you put things in the pockets (i.e. phone, beanie, tissues). I’m pear shaped and definitely felt more bottom heavy but it’s a fun, different style that I love wearing for a month to mix up my winter coat/jacket game.","6-Feb-2020"

It runs large and on my 5'4 frame just didn't work. The puffiest part was around my hips making me look like a pear. If you are on the tall, slim side, I think this could work.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kanda-puffer?color=230","DelBud","Odd shape but fun","I thought it looked ridiculous the first time I tried it on, but then it grew on me.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kanda-puffer?color=230","KCS","Fashion & Function!","I really enjoyed this pick, and if it had fit perfectly I would have bought it in a heartbeat as I'm looking for a puffer coat that's stylish but functional. I've worn this in 33-ish-degree mixed-precipitation weather and was plenty warm, though I wonder how it will hold up against true near-zero temperatures. It's very stylish and fashion-forward, although the tie at the side is more of an inconvenience than I was anticipating and doesn't cinch quite as tight as I'd like. The green is a deep, rich green, something I love, and the sleeves were the perfect length for my shorter arms. The shape of it wasn't quite spot-on for my pear-shaped body, but I expected that. Nonetheless, although it wasn't quite as flattering on me as it was on the model, I still loved it enough to wear it more than once. Definitely worth renting just to have people ask where I got it!","15-Jan-2020"

Now that I'm thinking about it - why didn't I put it in my new Nuuly box? Gosh. Anyway, I'm 5' 8"", 150ish lbs (flex between 140-155) and straight shaped with a big chest, but I got the small instead of a medium. LOVE the rust color, and actually this was surprisingly warm? The arms were a LITTLE tight in the small, which made bell-sleeve sweaters kind of tough to put on under this, but it fit more 'tailored' than I assume the medium would and I'd get the small again. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful coat. The only thing I didn't love were that the snaps were silver, and seemed to stand out a little too much.","8-Apr-2020"

The color is amazing, it's so soft and pretty warm - not dead of winter with snow warm, but a nice 40 degree day you'll be set! The only downfall of this jacket is that it has a series of snaps for the closure going down the front of it, that when closed you can't see but when open there's a lot. Due to wearing this while 30-34 weeks pregnant I wasn't able to properly close the jacket so the snaps were always showing. Otherwise, this was a hit! I got a lot of compliments and the huge pockets were a nice bonus. Also, at 5'1"" this came to right above my ankle length wise.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It wa a perfect for winter here in the south but there is no way this would be warm enough to wear in the snow. The material was soft but more like a cardigan.

Also, I'm no princess and the pea, but for those of you who, like me, have human skin: the torso is lined, but the sleeves aren't, so next stop: itchville.

I have a narrow waist and wide hips, though, so maybe on a straighter body it would work better. Kept putting it on and never wore it.","25-Jan-2020"

I stepped out of my comfort zone and rented this and I can honestly say I am still not a fan of cold shoulder shirts. This is a beautiful color of red and the material is really nice. The fit, however, is not for me. I had way too much room in the chest, shoulders and arms. I could go down a size but honestly, the cut outs make the sweater sit weird on my body. For reference, I am a traditional apple shape. Broad shoulders, weight in middle however, my chest is on the smaller side. This did not work for my body type at all.","15-Jan-2020"

I felt like the sweater itself was fine quality and fit too loose around the waist area (you can sorta see the bagginess in the pic of the model). If I left it untucked it was almost sloppy. I tucked it and wore my highest jeans to tighten it and give me more of a figure. I have to give it 4 stars because i got a lot of compliments on it from strangers and friends.

You can dress them down or up - I personally wore them with casual tees and sneakers. The best part of these pants: last month I was in Vegas with my two best friends to see a Shania Twain concert. I was wearing these beauties while day drinking and walked up to a bar to order a drink when this beautiful 40-something-year-old woman tells me how much she loves my pants. We get to talking and next thing you know, she's inviting me and my 2 best friends to sit at her VIP bottle-service-table at the Shania Twain concert that she had reserved for that night (our tickets were for nose bleed seats). It was one of the best nights of my entire life and it's all because of the conversation that was started because of these pants.","23-Apr-2020"

I'm typically a size 4 (Lucky) or 6 (American Eagle) in jeans, so I snagged a 28 - I've heard Levi's run a little small, and these ones def were snug. I loved the rise, but due to my height (5'9) they just weren't quite the right length on me. These hit somewhere between a capri and an ankle jean, which just wasn't quite right. I had fun with them while I had them, though!","9-Feb-2020"

The fit is so amazing and has just the right amount of stretch so they are super comfortable for a whole day in them if needed!! I usually paired them with a black or white cami, and then a black jean jacket on top. One time I paired them with an olive green turtle neck, plus some black booties and big hoops.

When I got the 26 I had to do some shimmying and a big suck in to get them on the first time. There is 1% elastin so they keep their shape and don't stretch out, but they did give a little, making them perfect after a few wears. Got lots of compliments, definitely purchasing.","30-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ribcage-ankle-straight-jeans?color=220","kmhberlin","I think they're trendy?","Maybe I'm too old to wear this kind of jean. I love it in the pictures, I love it when I see people on the street, but when I put them on, they reminded me of the Saturday Night Live mom jean skit. Where did we go wrong here? Well, first I'm pretty short, so I think these jeans would look really nice on a taller woman. Still, there were quite a few petite woman in the reviews raving about these. The second thing: although I'm small, I'm kind of curvy. I think this shape would better flatter somebody with a more straight figure and not such a big waist/hip ratio. I think it was the combination of short and hippy that made these not work for me. Otherwise, I liked the wash, and I think somebody else could really rock these.","23-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ribcage-ankle-straight-jeans?color=220","Amison","Way too long","I love the idea of this style, but the pants fit way different than the model in the picture.

I'm 5'1, 110 pounds and normally, flare jeans, in particular, run too large. While they do hit just slightly below my ankle (where they probably weren't made to hit) they still look fabulous. These jeans are incredible but do not have much stretch whatsoever. I have gotten other pants from Nuuly made of jeans or corduroy that I now know must've had a bit of stretch or give to them so keep this in mind if you aren't sure of your exact measurements. I put them on first out of the bag and immediately purchased them. These will be a staple!","9-Jan-2020"

The only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because the flap that covers the buttons down the center puffs out a bit which made me look slightly bloated. I ultimately didn't mind but the pants would be better off without that flap and have the buttons exposed.

We get to talking and next thing you know, she's inviting me and my 2 best friends to sit at her VIP bottle-service-table at the Shania Twain concert that she had reserved for that night (our tickets were for nose bleed seats).

When I got the 26 I had to do some shimmying and a big suck in to get them on the first time. There is 1% elastin so they keep their shape and don't stretch out, but they did give a little, making them perfect after a few wears. Got lots of compliments, definitely purchasing.","30-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ribcage-ankle-straight-jeans?color=093","kmhberlin","I think they're trendy?","Maybe I'm too old to wear this kind of jean. I love it in the pictures, I love it when I see people on the street, but when I put them on, they reminded me of the Saturday Night Live mom jean skit. Where did we go wrong here? Well, first I'm pretty short, so I think these jeans would look really nice on a taller woman. Still, there were quite a few petite woman in the reviews raving about these. The second thing: although I'm small, I'm kind of curvy. I think this shape would better flatter somebody with a more straight figure and not such a big waist/hip ratio. I think it was the combination of short and hippy that made these not work for me. Otherwise, I liked the wash, and I think somebody else could really rock these.","23-Jan-2020"

I'm 5'1, 110 pounds and normally, flare jeans, in particular, run too large. While they do hit just slightly below my ankle (where they probably weren't made to hit) they still look fabulous. These jeans are incredible but do not have much stretch whatsoever. I have gotten other pants from Nuuly made of jeans or corduroy that I now know must've had a bit of stretch or give to them so keep this in mind if you aren't sure of your exact measurements.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ribcage-ankle-straight-jeans?color=093","maria13","Loved the look and fit!","These pants are so cool. I loved them! They fit perfectly and somehow made me feel taller. The only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because the flap that covers the buttons down the center puffs out a bit which made me look slightly bloated. I ultimately didn't mind but the pants would be better off without that flap and have the buttons exposed. I still absolutely loved wearing these --- and as a plus, I wore these to a Jonas Brothers concert and randomly met them! So these pants were seen and touched by the JoBros!","12-Oct-2019"

I am a 28 in madewell jeans for reference but sometimes a 29 in other brands. I ordered a 29 in these, so if between sizes, I would recommend going w the larger, particularly if you have thick thighs.","28-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/coco-strappy-midi-dress?color=066","yomajessty","Beautiful comfy dress","I absolutely loved this dress and had it not been so expensive, I would’ve bought it. I got it as a last minute piece I needed to fill my nuuly, and didn’t think much of it at first. Once I put it on though, I fell in love. It was not only extremely comfortable, but also the pink looked so great with my red hair and skin tone. I wore this at least 7-8 times the month I had it (during quarantine) because it was so comfortable for running to the grocery store and also lounging around at home.","7-May-2020"

I ordered an XS and it fit just fine, small might've been a tad bit too big.

It’s such great quality and so cute but runs really big. I ordered a small instead of my usual XS as I’m almost 6 months pregnant but shouldn’t have. It was more flowy than I’d hoped but it worked and I likely would have worn it again except it’s February and still too cold. Worked with a jean jacket over for my event!","9-Feb-2020"
