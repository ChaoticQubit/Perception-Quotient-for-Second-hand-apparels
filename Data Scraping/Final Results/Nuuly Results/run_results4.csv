It's a bit oversized but it's so comfy and perfect for around the house, but also pretty enough to wear out. I love the back! I'm only 4'11"" and the length was perfect on me, not too long. My only issue is the front is a bit too low/wide, otherwise would purchase. You can adjust the straps in the back but it didn't seem to solve the issue in the front.","19-May-2020"

It's sooo fun for the right occasion and I might order it again in the future. The only funky things to note are the sleeve length (The seem to ride up to become more 80's style than the fun balloon look they're giving in the photo) and the cinched waist (it puffs out in a bit of an unflattering way). It's absurdly cute in photos, though. Highly recommend ordering if you're going to have your photo taken :).","19-May-2020"

Once I found that zipper it was a perfect fit! this is a great short fit and flare with amazing colors that is sure to WOW! The sleeves were a bit aggressive, but added to the fun! I am 5'5"" and 155 and it may have been a bit short for bending over - but that didn't stop me from enjoying every second of this dress!","18-May-2020"

I dont know who would actually be able to pull this off thats taller than 5’2. I love showing off my legs but its inappropriate for someone who is 25 to wear something that short. It also looks odd considering how much volume is on the top with the sleeves. If it were two inches longer then i would consider wearing it out.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sunset-striped-sweater?color=062","MegMeg","LOVE this sweater!","I absolutely love this sweater. The colors are just a vibrant and gorgeous in person, and I adore the material it’s made of - it doesn’t feel thick or bulky at all. It feels super flowy, comfortable, and lightweight. This definitely wouldn’t be the piece to go for if you’re looking for a super warm sweater, but it would be a great item to wear during a chilly evening or during the spring. This ended up being my favorite piece that I got in my Nuuly for the month, and I’m very tempted to buy. I would definitely recommend sizing down - I typically go for a women’s large because I prefer a looser fit, and I’m so glad I went with a medium for this piece! Even the medium felt a bit loose, and I think a small may have fit me better, but I didn’t mind the loose, flowy fit.","13-Mar-2020"

High quality, thick fabric and nice embroidery. That said, I could definitely have gone down a size - quite large in the waist, and very generous in the bust, even as a DD -- excepting the fact that this really puts the ""mini"" in mini dress. If you're an hourglass shape I'd caution you if you don't like super short dresses. Definitely not as long as it appears on the fit model.","13-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/maldives-wrap-top?color=011","Autumatopoeia","Sexy Tablecloth","""It looks like you're wearing a really sexy tablecloth. In a good way."" - BF I'm on the fence about purchasing this top for keeps. The fabric is PERFECT -- it's light, delicately patterned, and not-too-sheer. The fit is 75% there -- The tie-waist is flattering. However, the neckline is looooow AF. It's light enough to wear a cami under, but the sleeves. The sleeves are SUPER POOF. I tried rolling them up, but the wrist is unusually tight, and could only get in 2 turns. It's definitely a fun summer top, but being busty, I don't need a ton of extra upper-body volume and would consider keeping only with a trip too the tailor to trim those pirate poofs down.","13-Apr-2020"

It's a little sheer, but not bad especially if you're working from home and not moving around very much! I wore it with pants or longer shorts because if you don't you look exactly like the model and look like you're not wearing anything underneath. But hey if you're working from home then that doesn't even matter! Lastly, it's suuper flowy, which is fun and comfortable, but not actually that flattering. While I enjoyed wearing it I also couldn't decide if I looked like I was wearing a maternity shirt. That being said, pregnant peeps might love this top for all the extra room.","13-May-2020"

The waist was also loose, which is saying a lot since I am a new mom still loosing her baby belly. Woah Nelly!

I'm not sure if the quarantine-15 have completely focused on my thighs, but there was no way I could wear this for more than just a try-on session. I'm fairly petite (5'1) and normally a XSP so I really didn't expect this to be so tight. It also ran a lot shorter than on the model.

If you have teeny tiny thighs and a very thin neck, this will probably look great on you! If you have average thigh and neck proportions, do not rent this! I should have listened to other reviewers. The thighs are so tight, and if I lean forward in this jumpsuit at all, the neck strap chokes me. It's just not comfortable at all.","10-Apr-2020"

Soft, cozy, felt like wearing a favorite sweatshirt, but so much more stylish. The colors, weight and style would be good in any season but summer. I wore it a LOT and found it went with quite a few things I already own. I am considering buying it.","28-Mar-2020"

But I couldn't get the dress to sit evenly, it was always so much shorter in the back. Material was nice for the summer, thin but thats what I like and the color was interesting but flattering.","29-Apr-2020"

I thought it was an appropriate length on me (5' 8"") and the straps are adjustable which is a major plus. Not sure how easily I could wear a bra with it, but I am looking forward to putting this with some sneakers or casual shoes and a denim jacket.","17-Mar-2020"

But on me, it looks like the “pirate shirt” from Seinfeld. I’m too big-boned for the flowy design. I have big shoulders, and the puffy sleeves made them look even bigger. Not for me but on someone petite, it could be lovely.","19-Mar-2020"

My only complaint is the shoulders are a ~little~ more aggressive than the look on the model (like puffier). But once summer comes around I think I will def be renting again to wear with sandals and a straw hat","22-Apr-2020"
