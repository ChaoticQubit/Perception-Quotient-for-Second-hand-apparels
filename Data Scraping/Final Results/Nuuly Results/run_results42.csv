"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Ninja","Cute, very wearable","The XS was the slightest bit short in the crotch but still fully wearable. I'm glad I got this size ultimately because one up would have been too much. Loved the color, material, and the look was great. Less ""cropped"" for a petite but not too long. I would have worn it again if I wasn't working from home every day now!","18-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Ericalr42484","Weird fit","Maybe because I‚Äôm short and round - but did not fit me well! I liked the material though, cool concept .","4-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","rbfly","Classy jumpsuit! Not 100% comfy though.","My fianc√© said of all the jumpsuits I rented, this was his favorite- and I loved it too but since the shelter at home order never found it quite comfortable enough to wear while working from home. Fabric is just not quite cozy or forgiving enough to feel luxurious sitting in a chair on video calls all day. But would try it again once we are able to be out and about.","3-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","VeryVA","Simply GORGEOUS","I wore this to a dinner party and to an awards dinner. It says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm classy‚Äù without trying too hard. Good for long torsos and athletic builds.","3-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","MDB","Elegant and comfortable","I was ready to take it off by the end of the evening but it was a nice jumpsuit, well made and beautiful. I did not think it was extremely flattering on me.","2-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Trieustory","Not the right fit for my body type","This was a cute jumpsuit but it didn‚Äôt look good on me because I‚Äôm pretty petite. It was too long and loose so it looked like I was swallowed by the fabric. I think it would look good on someone who was taller!","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","RachDip","So soft and comfortable","This was so cute and VERY flattering. I wore it about 3 times during the month and absolutely loved it.","7-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Lmarievp","Fun piece for work","This jumpsuit was super cute and comfy. I‚Äôm a curvier girl, so the medium was a tiny bit too tight around the bottom, but not enough to make it unwearable. Fit great everywhere else. It looked great from the outside, but I was anxious all day that I‚Äôd rip the seam if I bent over too fast üò¨ I‚Äôd be interested to see it on me in a large.","4-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","SaraDSF222","Wore it all the time / dress up and dress down","A super cute, comfortable jumpsuit that can be dressed up or down depending on shoes and accessories! I got the XS (I'm 5'3"" / 116lbs and on the curvy side) and it felt a tad loose. But definitely still fitting enough to wear. I got lots of compliments and ended up buying it!","18-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","rachelrachel","Great material!","I was very surprised by this piece and how well it fit. The color and material are gorgeous. Definitely thicker fabric. The quality was great. I wore it with ankle boots to a holiday party. I loved that it has pockets!","16-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","ccccc","So flattering!","It was a little short on me, so it might not fit great if you're tall, but I loved wearing it and got so many compliments.","15-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","eyelinerdiner","Love the fit, not for shorter people","I absolutely love this jumpsuit, and I rarely wear jumpsuit. It's both cute and sophisticated. In terms of waist, it fits true to size, but if you're short like me, you'll need to wear heels for it to not look sloppy.","15-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","HomeStylist","Perfect Texas holiday outfit","I felt like a million bucks in this! Perfect for Christmas Eve and New Years in warmer Texas weather. The velvet cord was soft and yummy. Almost bought. Perfect for flats or heals. I‚Äôm very petite and it fit like a glove but that probably means it runs a tiny bit small.","9-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","CaitlinP","Perfect for NYE","Wore with black heels for New Year‚Äôs Eve! Fit perfect. Not too long like most rompers!","5-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Haleybreed","Amazing","I never wale a jumpsuit before and this made me feel so confident! I wore this to a New Year‚Äôs Eve 20‚Äôs murder mystery party where I played the cop. I never wanted to take it off, it‚Äôs so adorable! Fit like a glove.","5-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","sarahsd","Trendy Jumpsuit","Fit perfectly even though my torso is a little shorter. Such a pretty/soft material. Had to double tape / semi hem the bottom for length but otherwise perfect with heels!","31-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","queen_b","Not for petite women","This was a cute jumpsuit, but it was too long for me. It fit when I folded it from the bottom a few times, but the neckline was too low so I couldn‚Äôt ever wear it out.","28-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","tohman","Elegant","I received several compliments each time I wore this jumpsuit. It fit great and felt great. High quality and comfortable. I usually wear a small, but the XSmall fit perfect.","23-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","LLoveLy","I was too tall","This jumpsuit is gorgeous. I was so bummed that it was too short in the torso for me to wear. It doesn't have any stretch. Sadly, I won't be able to wear it. Size up, and if you're 5'8""+ you might want to move on to something else.","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","bkborn","great piece","I wore this a ton. Great piece. Fit great, looked amazing on my body. A little bit hard to get in and out of, but totally worth it.","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Missouri","Really cute, but need to have right body-type","It was a risk ordering this jumpsuit for an event with no backup, and fortunately it worked! The material is a fine corduroy that feels more like velvet. I loved the structured shoulders. I paired it with some black, high block heels and fun earrings for a Christmas party. I tied the tie like a sash instead of a bow and it was much more flattering. I felt like I was pushing it in the small and could have used a medium. I'm 5'8"", 135lb, with a healthy booty and hips. Looks great if you've got long legs. Very happy with this rental!","19-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","mirandamn","So cute","Really cute and perfect fabric for winter. I found this jumpsuit super comfortable as well. I'm 5'8"" and the crop in the pants part is really short. I still think it looked fine, but would keep in mind if you're a little on the taller side","16-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","InsincerelyJules","Ton of compliments","I loved wearing this jumpsuit. It fit well, was very flattering, an I always got a ton of compliments. The material was also thick enough that it kept me warm in chilly weather.","16-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","ericab","Comfy cute!`","This jumper was so cute and comfortable. It was a little baggy in the belly/crotch area which can be a little awkward but I tied the belt to hang down in front and thought it worked. Definitely came across more casual than I expected.","3-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Mosh","Casual comfort, elegant look.","I am a medium but I ordered a large because nothing worse than a tight jumpsuit. I only wished I had more places to wear it.","3-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","MarissaA","Comfortable and warm!","I wanted a jumpsuit I could either dress up or down, and this is the perfect fit! I wore out for a casual date night and was incredibly comfortable the whole evening. As a shorter person, I'm always worried about the torso and length, but this was absolutely perfect.","1-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","FoodLover615","Perfect for Work Holiday Party!","Loved this. So comfy and gone tons of compliments. It's not too low cut for a work night party, but still fun and sassy. I normally wear a size 4-6/Small or Medium, and the M worked here.","24-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","ProfessorofFashion","So comfortable","I loved this jumpsuit and wore it several times. It is very comfortable and easy to wear, but I will say that I didn't get any compliments on it. Where I work, we complement and comment on each other's outfits a lot so it says something that no one said anything.","21-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Glorbo","Surprisingly comfortable!","Let me start by saying I'm petite and have NEVER found a jumpsuit that works on me and isn't weird & baggy in the crotch, until now. This fit well and accentuated my curves. The only sizing issue is that the legs were slightly long on me, so I had to wear it with heels (and not heeled boots, cause it would hit at a weird place on the boots). If I owned this I would have gotten the bottoms hemmed. That being said, I got a lot of compliments wearing it, and it is SO comfortable. It legit feels like pajamas. It's a LOOK, but a subtle one. I felt really cool in this.","20-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","stephsmith","Classy and versatile","Great fit, great look! Usually jumpsuits are a bit harder for me since i have a small chest but thicker thighs (and short legs lol) but a S was the perfect fit for me! Super comfy and classy","19-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","vigmia","Gateway drug to jumpers","I'm usually a fashion coward, but this jumper was a great intro to a world where you can get away with wearing a pajama in a professional work setting and still look professional AF. I dressed it up with a necklace and received countless compliments.","11-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Julia","Amazing jumpsuit!","This is my favorite thing I‚Äôve rented so far. So beautiful and the fabric is amazing. Received several compliments and found it to be really flattering. Considering purchasing!","10-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","cait","The Velvet Fog","If it were socially acceptable, I would drape myself in velvet. Wore this to Seinfeld trivia night and a few holiday parties. The jumpsuit arrived without the belt, but a quick chat to Nuuly customer service and they quickly sent it to me. Thanks, Nuuly!","5-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Nicoles412","Favorite Jumpsuit","Love the luxe feel and comfort of this jumpsuit. I was afraid of getting the small after reading other reviews so I sized up to the medium and it fit perfectly. I'm short and have a short torso and had no issues.","28-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Blake","Cute","It's definitely cute - the belt is nice if you've got an hourglass figure and want to give the piece more shape. And it's got pockets! Although the pockets did sit at a bit of an awkward place - once I put the belt on to sinch the waist they kinda stuck out and made my hips look bigger. I'd say overall it was cute but didn't have the 'wow' factor to it.","26-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","Yello","Cute but nothing special","It was a fun one piece, very comfortable. The belt loop broke off right away, but I was still able to tie the belt. It was cute but probably wouldn‚Äôt rent it again.","24-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","rhiannevengel","Slimming Jumpsuit","This belted jumpsuit hits all the right spots on me and was very flattering. I wore it to a concert with booties and hoop earrings. It was so comfortable and soft and I loved wearing it.","16-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","GerriAnn","Great Fall Transition Piece","Fit like a glove. The corduroy is very soft and looks like velvet. Liked this one so much I purchased it.","15-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","CR","Great jumpsuit","A great piece, comfortable and easy to wear. It does run a bit small so if you a long torso I‚Äôd size up. The XS fit snug but not too tight.","14-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/elton-corded-jumpsuit?color=041","JodyP","Perfect Fit, luxurious feel, Favorite Nuuly Yet!","This jumpsuit ticks all the fit boxes for me. It accentuates my narrow waist and doesn't ride up into my large bottom at all. It feels good and looks beautiful. I got A LOT of compliments from men and women. My favorite from a male coworker saying, ""Is that a velvet jumpsuit?! Ballin!"" I went to an event with a lot of hugging and people kept on commenting on how nice it felt.","1-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/georgette-plaid-handkerchief-skirt?color=050","catcity","Cute and easy","I like this skirt a lot. The length is perfect and the pattern is fun! I wore it a few times with docs. My only complaint is that it was super pilled and the material just felt a bit ragged for something so expensive. I would consider renting it again because of the style and fit but idk if I would purchase longterm because of the fabric. </3","14-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/georgette-plaid-handkerchief-skirt?color=050","Adrianne","Yes! Yes! Yes!","Loved this skirt. I mostly wore it casually with sandals and a t shirts ice i was on vacation but the fabric is silk shiny so it would look great with boots and a leather jacket.","8-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/topanga-trousers?color=001","turnn2paige","Cute, but Stretched out","I wore it with a shirt loose over the top of them because they honestly didn't stay up too well...the legs fit nicely, and I know that we are in the rental space, so maybe the elastic got stretched out on the pair I received overtime, but they gave me more of a diaper butt look more than anything else. Otherwise loved the silky material and that they could be dressed up or down.","28-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/topanga-trousers?color=001","vscrimer","Pajama-like pants","These looked oddly pajama like in person and I had a hard time dressing them up enough to not look like I was wearing pajamas. That might've been because they wrinkle easily and run large--I was swimming in a small.","14-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/topanga-trousers?color=001","Quinn","Looks cute in photos - different in-home","These looked like substantial, matte black pants in the photos, but they were very thin and shiny when they arrived at my house - so unfortunately, given the temperature and what I had chosen them for (work) -they didn't work out.","14-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/topanga-trousers?color=001","BabrahamLincoln","Waistband loose","Wish the waistband was tighter!! Love how comfy they are and the fabric. I got a Small, and the band was too loose leading the pants to sag throughout the day. It made it very difficult to wear with a tucked in top, which stinks but isn't the end of the world.","11-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/topanga-trousers?color=001","mariaho19","Really cute - weird material","I really wanted to love these pants. I got compliments on them the two times I wore them to work BUT they are not wrinkle friendly. Sitting in them all day at work caused pretty noticeable wrinkles in the knees and hips. I had to steam them to wear them a second time and that still didn't quite do the trick. They are super comfy and fun work pants!","10-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/topanga-trousers?color=001","Alysiamarie","Not for leggy girls","These were a bit too short for my 5'10"" figure with extra long legs, though I did end up wearing once with black tights underneath to distract where the pant actually ended. Also I have wider hips, so I do wish I sized up to a large to get more of a looser look.","10-Feb-2020"

Think they would be cute on someone taller, but wouldn't recommend them for shorter petite frames.

They are comfy thin-wale corduroy. They are the perfect length for me, and the fit has ease but has a flattering shape, too. I love the higher-rise waist. The only problem I had with them - and this is a consistent issue for me when looking for jeans and corduroy pants - is that the waistband was too loose. I have junk in the trunk and wide hips, but then go in at the waist, making it difficult to find pants. So, in conclusion: these are great pants. If you have the same issue I do, body-shape-wise, make sure you have a belt handy to keep these guys from falling down.","15-Nov-2019"

They are comfy thin-wale corduroy. They are the perfect length for me, and the fit has ease but has a flattering shape, too. I love the higher-rise waist. The only problem I had with them - and this is a consistent issue for me when looking for jeans and corduroy pants - is that the waistband was too loose. I have junk in the trunk and wide hips, but then go in at the waist, making it difficult to find pants. So, in conclusion: these are great pants. If you have the same issue I do, body-shape-wise, make sure you have a belt handy to keep these guys from falling down.","15-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/high-rise-skinny-corduroy-jeans2?color=068","LADYDJ","A winner despite being loose in the waist - needed to wear a belt.","These cords are almost perfect. They are comfy thin-wale corduroy. They are the perfect length for me, and the fit has ease but has a flattering shape, too. I love the higher-rise waist. The only problem I had with them - and this is a consistent issue for me when looking for jeans and corduroy pants - is that the waistband was too loose. I have junk in the trunk and wide hips, but then go in at the waist, making it difficult to find pants. So, in conclusion: these are great pants. If you have the same issue I do, body-shape-wise, make sure you have a belt handy to keep these guys from falling down.","15-Nov-2019"

The butt was very 'Mom jeans' on me, and even the legs were a tiny bit baggier than I like in skinny jeans. The fabric was very soft, they were extremely comfortable, and I received a lot of compliments. I have to say, the print looks more bright and red on the Nuuly website than in real life.

They are comfy thin-wale corduroy. They are the perfect length for me, and the fit has ease but has a flattering shape, too. I love the higher-rise waist. The only problem I had with them - and this is a consistent issue for me when looking for jeans and corduroy pants - is that the waistband was too loose. I have junk in the trunk and wide hips, but then go in at the waist, making it difficult to find pants. So, in conclusion: these are great pants. If you have the same issue I do, body-shape-wise, make sure you have a belt handy to keep these guys from falling down.","15-Nov-2019"

The butt was very 'Mom jeans' on me, and even the legs were a tiny bit baggier than I like in skinny jeans. The fabric was very soft, they were extremely comfortable, and I received a lot of compliments. I have to say, the print looks more bright and red on the Nuuly website than in real life.

It's definitely on the fancy side and I couldn't figure out how to dress it down. It also wasn't the most flattering style. You likely have to be on the slimmer side to pull it off and it didn't hug my curves in the right places.","9-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lady-in-red-mini?color=060","Kylie","Much more formal than appears!","Maybe it was just me but when I looked at the pictures I thought it was a lace summer dress. I got it with the intention of dressing it down with a jean jacket and the option to dress it up if wanted but this piece is firmly in the cocktail category. It looks cute with the jacket but I felt way too formal to wear it to work. It's very high quality material and super structured, the bottom fabric is sewn separately so it's always flowing outward which gives it an extra formal dress feel. I only wore it out to a nice cocktail bar but it would have fit great at a wedding or other event. My only complaint is it was a tad tight on the hips but nothing uncomfortable.","15-Nov-2019"

The top sags enough (bc it‚Äôs too long) that it actually alleviates the tightness on the shoulders and back unless I need to stretch to reach something. Can‚Äôt slump or it feels tight.

I wore it for a formal dinner with a small gold necklace and sparkly earrings and black strappy heels. I wish I had a more sparkly necklace to really dress it up more. Jewelry is essential to complete this dress because without it, it felt a like Judge Judy/ the Grim Reaper at the Ball. I‚Äôm short and it felt a little long and was a big awkward in getting the overlay to sit right. I got a S and I think I should have gotten an XS. I may order and XS and try it. I think a more cinched empire waist, but still loose and flowy would make it more flattering and less Graduation Day, but I don‚Äôt even care. I love this dress. I will say the tiny loops in the shoulders of the overlay drove me INSANE and were the major downside to the dress, and it being a rental, I couldn‚Äôt cut them out. They do not stay tucked in and even if they did, you see them through the overlay and it messes up the beautiful seam and neck/shoulder area. It was a constant frustration through dinner. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre necessary for hanging so I would just cut them off if it were my dress to keep. Super annoying. Otherwise, AMAZING DRESS.","27-Jan-2020"

I was feeling puffy & bloated from the holidays - so I appreciated the forgiving nature of all of the fabric. :) The dress is a ‚Äúlook‚Äù - but I liked it!","4-Jan-2020"

The dress is in two pieces - the top layer and slip. The top layer was way too over-sized and the v-neck was a weird length and cut that competed with the slip (just didn't fall right). Was also way too long and lost it's shape with all the excess fabric.","2-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/spell-casting-midi?color=001","malorimaeva","Stevie Nicks Vibes","This dress was really fun, roomy as hell, and a liiiitttttle bit sexy. I wouldn't wear it to an event with a lot of photo-ops because it's really unflattering in pictures. I kept joking to my boyfriend that I felt like I was in the church choir or was walking the stage at graduation. Having said that, I loved the oversize sheer overlay with the sexy little slip underneath. It was perfect for a dinner date - I ate an obscene amount of food and never felt uncomfortable or restricted at all. It's not something I'd want in my closet full time but honestly, that's the whole reason I signed up for Nuuly. It was super fun for a night out and I can't wait to swap it for something crazy next month! Fit notes: -the overlay is BIG. If you're really petite, this might not be the best look for you. -the straps on the slip are adjustable which is important because the boobs fit a little funky. I was able to compensate for that odd fit by adjusting the straps and it was no problem after that!","9-Dec-2019"

This dress is two separate parts - the sheer flowing part and a black slip. The slip is DEF true to size. So while the sheer dress is more like a tent, if the slip is too small, you have to improvise. I wore this will a little black tank dress underneath. The sheer dress has those little snappy things that help hold your bra/dress straps in place btw. I like that feature. I wore this as part of a costume, because I'm not quite THAT fashion forward, but it was still very cool!","25-Oct-2019"

It fit well in the shoulder area, but ended up being so cropped that I never felt comfortable wearing it out. Even with high-waisted pants, I still had a couple inches more of bare skin until the bottom of the shirt. Also, because it was a medium, there was some gaping in the back at the bottom, so overall I felt pretty exposed. It's such a cute top though, and super soft! Wish I felt comfortable enough to rock it.","10-Dec-2019"

It's definitely cute but the fit wasn't perfect - I would have preferred it to be a bit more fitted around the torso. I also didn't have the right high waisted bottom item to pair with it - it needs something quite high waisted unless you want to show midriff. I tried to make it work with a skirt and just didn't love my look but I think it could look great with high waisted wide leg jeans, similar to what the model is wearing!","6-Dec-2019"

I did feel like I could look a bit lumpy on top if I were wearing it with a crop top, so I styled it with tunics to glide over that. I know many people said these pants ran big, but I'm typically between a 29/30 and I thought they were on the tighter side through the leg. I think that's because while they stretch in the top (not too much), the seams prevent them from stretching through the knee.","10-Dec-2019"

I usually wear a 25 or 26 waist and ordered the 26. I wish I went with the 25 because these jeans do run large. I am able to wear the jeans with a belt and get away with the larger size. But I would size down next time I order them. The side paneling is super cute and goes with everything!","11-Oct-2019"

They're so soft, they have just enough give, and the boyfriend fit is so flattering. I love the side stripe detail too - it adds some visual interest but is still neutral enough to wear with a ton of stuff. I wore these a bunch of times and really like them. My only critique is they run kind of big, I'm normally a 26-27 and I ordered a 27 and they're HUGE. I think they work because they're already a loose fit, but I probably also could have gotten a 25 and still fit in them well. LOVE these though!","10-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/pilcro-mid-rise-slim-boyfriend-jeans29?color=093","Cam","Great jeans but stretch with wear","When I first put these on I was sure I was going to wear them everyday for the entire month, they're some of the comfiest jeans I've ever worn! But alas, after only a few wears they stretched out so much and look so baggy on me that I had to give up that dream. This may be my fault. I got a size that is on the upper edge of my jean-size-spectrum and could have probably afforded myself more self confidence and gone for a smaller size. Let my error become your lesson and believe that these run true to size, if not a little larger, and are very stretchy and forgiving!","7-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/see-the-rainbow-sweater?color=061","LadyGodiva","Cute, unique retro sweater","This sweater was cute but I think it looks significantly different in person than it does on the model. I am guessing they have it clipped in several places on her. The sleeves are odd and actually start kind of wide at the top and taper as they get to your wrists. The neckline also goes almost all the way off your shoulders so hiding a bra strap is a little difficult but not impossible. The sleeves were long in my usual size which is pretty normal for FP; I just fold them back. I was most surprised by how boxy my sweater was - I could tuck it in the front but would not be able to pull off what the model has styled. I still wore it and thought it was cute and different, but not what I expected. Also, this sweater is thin and not very warm, would be good for spring.","22-Apr-2020"

I'm pretty tall/curvy with 38DD, so I ordered an XL, but dang, you could probably wrap this around the Titanic and still have some left over for the iceberg. On the bright side -- the rainbow design is so, so cute (I loved it so much I ended up belting the sweater so I could wear it at least once). Just size down and you'll be golden!","17-Feb-2020"

I got so many compliments on the color and how soft it looked (and trust me, it was soft).

I wasn't obsessed with how tight the arms were in comparison with the billowy sweater. Big sleeves are everything and this doesn't have those. Sheds little gray floofies everywhere. The neckline was super awkward IMO. I hate that ribbon/string thing that some sweaters come with that keep the neck from stretching out (?). Normally I cut that dang thing off all my sweaters but obvi I wasn't going to deface this nuuly piece. It would be cuter if the neckline was fully open, or just a straight up crew. This was in between and weird. I wore this around my apartment mostly, felt too frumpy wearing it to work.","22-Oct-2019"

It was great to throw on with jeans and I got lots of complements, just make sure you aren‚Äôt expecting it to be fitted.","22-Oct-2019"

The sleeves were super long and the shape kind of baggy. I'd consider sizing down next time. I also found the material to be scratchy and not super comfortable to wear all day.","22-Oct-2019"

I wore it on a trip to Colorado- was SUPER warm, neutral because of the grey, but fun because the rainbow! I sized down to a small because I know free people runs large. Highly recommend!! Was cropped/hip length- I wore it with high waisted jeans and did a front tuck!","11-Oct-2019"

I love the colours! I thought it would be itchy to wear but because it's lightweight it was fine. I like the sweater tucked in or out. The only thing is that I'm petite so the sleeves are a tad long on me. When it cools down I will probably buy it because it's so pretty.","28-Sep-2019"

But when I put it on and tucked a little in right in the front.. it transformed. Really fun sweater for the transitioning weather- I wore it with jean shorts and jeans.","24-Sep-2019"
