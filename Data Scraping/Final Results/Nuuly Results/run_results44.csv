"https://www.nuuly.com/products/robin-embroidered-maxi?color=015","ShenAnniegans","Versatile dress","I really enjoyed wearing this dress. I actually wore it around while engaging in my daily activities--and it didn't feel too fancy. Although it could definitely be worn out as well. The material is really pretty, although the fabric is a bit heavier on bottom than I would have expected, which worked well for the 80 degree weather, but may have been a bit too heavy in the 90+ degree weather that is on its way.","11-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/robin-embroidered-maxi?color=015","BrittC","Beautiful, but size up for bust","This dress was gorgeous. It is delicate - it has some metallic thread embellishments - and those were pulled all over the dress when I received it. Nuuly was great and helped me given that I couldn't wear it out (the pull was dead center!) -- but would have loved to wear on vacation. It is fully lined, so it is definitely a bit heavier than a sundress style. I am a 16 in dresses normally, but this was VERY tight in the bust, especially if I wanted to wear a bra. I would size up if you are busty!","18-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/robin-embroidered-maxi?color=015","Lwyett1985","Looks better on the model","I loved this dress from afar even when it was sold on Anthro website. So when I saw it on nuuly in my size I snatched it up. Such a disappointment :-( the straps are so thin and the dress is a heavier knit. It just kind of hung and not in a flattering way. The stitching wasn’t lined up well so the design looked cheap. I just hated it. I think it’s something I’ll admire on others and have to concede it isn’t for me. Saddddd","7-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/robin-embroidered-maxi?color=015","bemybadger","Just not well fitting","The silhouette of this dress encourages either no bra or a strapless bra. I found the bust too loose without a bra and too tight with one. Alternatively either too dowdy or too risque, it just clearly wasn't the right dress for me. Also it was much too long for me but I'm not the tallest so I wasn't taken too aback by that. The color, fabric and embroidery were lovely, I'm sure it'd look great on someone taller or with a different bust line.","5-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/robin-embroidered-maxi?color=015","ALS949","Cute dress, just not for me","Too much material and too tight around chest. Would be cute if bigger size. This would be good for a very skinny person","22-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/robin-embroidered-maxi?color=015","CaitlynAdele","Beautiful Dress","I wore in on a vacation to Thailand and it was absolutely perfect. It fit so well and the length wasn't too long for a petite lady like me. The fabric is a bit heavier than expected, but not too heavy to wear in steamy Bangkok in the evening.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/robin-embroidered-maxi?color=015","Shelly","Easy Year-Round Dress","Loved this dress! It transitioned well from Summer to Fall, and I could see myself wearing this with a leather jacket in the winter. The bust was just a bit too tight, but the lining prevented anything from actually looking awkward. Would probably size up for that in the future, but it was otherwise wonderful.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/robin-embroidered-maxi?color=015","Qwertyuiop","Probably more like 3.5 stars","This dress was just okay. Got compliments but just wasn't my favorite. The fit was fine but overall I was just kind of underwhelmed I guess. Wore it twice, once to work and once to the beach, both times with a light wash denim jacket tied bolero style. 6'0, length was fine. As a caveat, choosing clothing rentals in early September in New York City is a bit of a crapshoot. You never know how the weather is going to break.","5-Oct-2019"

The only sizes available were 12 and 16W. Based on reviews saying the dress ran small up top, I gave the 16W a try. It was several inches too large in the chest and waist. Disappointing since it’s a beautiful dress.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It fit like a glove (though I did wear a black cami underneath as it was very low cut on me). Very pretty detailing and colors.

Received lots of compliments. I'm not tall but the petite size was the perfect length. I am busty, though, and this runs a little small in the bust.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruffled-polka-dot-midi?color=001","Soextra","Surprisingly flattering","Awesome dress, looking at the pics I thought it would be more loose/hippie style, but it actually cinches your waist quite nicely. My waist at the smallest point is 24.5"" (closer to 25"" than 24"") and it fit like it was tailored for me. The black on the sleeves make it look more avant-garde and less Little House on the Prairie. Not sure if the pics show this, but it has a slit on one side not too high as to be racy, just enough flattering. Another piece I'd have kept if I hadn't gone over budget this month.","19-Dec-2019"

The sleeves are adjustable (there is a button and hidden tab if you prefer a shorter sleeve). I did not notice this until the fourth time I wore it! For warmer weather, I styled with a platform sandal and huge hat (like the photo). For cooler weather, I layered with tights and Doc Martens. I think I could also wear a sheer mockneck or turtleneck underneath for even colder weather. Can you tell I am obsessed?","22-Oct-2019"

It took 3 people to zip up the dress as the zipper sticks at the waist.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/guest-of-honor-dress?color=000","rev1ewer","awkward dress","The colors and print are very pretty. The shape of the dress works conceptually. The delicate lacy details at the sleeves don't really work with the bold print, color, and fabric. The hips fit great, same with shoulder width and the length was perfect. However, there is a lot of extra room in the waist and the chest appears so skewed that one breast is appropriately ensconced and one is barely covered. It wasn't just lowcut, the sides didn't mirror each other. Because of the fit issues, the dress looks a little sloppy on. Perhaps this would hang more nicely on a straighter figure.","12-Dec-2019"

I'm a true hourglass shape, so it was pretty surprising that something so tight in the hips was so loose in the chest. While I could have worn it out (technically), any movement would have put me at risk for splitting the back. I would say it's this particularly piece that has sizing issues, as I got another dress from the same brand in the same size in my box, and that fit perfectly.","22-Nov-2019"

However, the lining inside did not match the cut of the dress. This kept me from fitting into my typical size. The lining is cut like a sheath (straight line).","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/guest-of-honor-dress?color=000","BrennaM","Cute but sizing is weird","I loved the material, pattern, and colors of this dress and it’s really well made. The sizing is VERY odd though. I’m usually a medium and got a large based on other reviews - it was still tight in my hips but still worked. The top was huge and it took a lot of work to make it look okay but it did. Wore it to a wedding and got a ton of compliments, was just real nerv about my chest popping out the whole time!","14-Nov-2019"

The belt seemed awkwardly too thin and the length too long. I gave it another try and wore it to work with a navy crop blazer. Given the season I needed tights and then had trouble figuring out which shoes to pair with it, again because of where it hit on my shins. I really think with a few tweaks to the belt and length this dress would be perfect. I loved the print and material. Maybe for a taller gal...","9-Jan-2020"

Just a warning that the back is fully sheer—which is cute and sexy—just in case you were hoping to be able to wear this to work.

I'm usually a size 10 and ordered the large in this top because I didn't want it to be too fitted - it was a perfect fit.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kiri-sweater?color=009","MelBert","Cute but Super Boxy Sweater","I wanted to love this sweater sooo badly. In the picture it looked soft and relaxed but in person it was really stiff and the arms were almost 3/4 sleeves (which in my opinion, you don't see in the picture!). I'd definitely go a size up if you're looking to achieve the same look as the model in the pictures! It's also a lot more boxy in the shoulders. I'm 5'7, 140 with a somewhat athletic build so maybe that's why I didn't look like the model? (LOL).","30-Jan-2020"

My first problem was that it was way more cropped than it looks in the pics. I wore high waisted jeans to solve that issue but it still was too short for my liking. My second problem was that the stitching all over it pulls very easy. I have a baby and a toddler so I literally wore it for a couple hours and it had at least 10 small pulls in it. I enjoyed wearing it but wouldn’t purchase it.","19-Jan-2020"

I got tons of compliments and it's so unique and fun. And maybe it's just me, but when I think of sweaters, I want them to be cozy in addition to being cute. This was unfortunately, pretty damn uncomfortable. The material is scratchy and stiff and overall just kind of hard to wear. I am usually a Medium in sweaters because I like them to be a little baggy, but I ordered an L/XL since the reviews said it ran small and it fit perfectly. Definitely a more boxy look though. If you have a comfortable turtle neck to layer under this you could probably get around the uncomfortable material.","15-Oct-2019"

I wore it to a casual dinner while on vacation in Hawaii so it was breezy but kept me warm when the sun went down. I thought the material wouldn't be as casual as it actually is (it's a soft cotton material) so I didn't feel like I could dress it up really, but it is perfect when you want to be lax but feel like you need give your outfit a little something. I paired it with a distressed-ankle, medium wash, straight leg jean and sandals so it went well with my minimal effort look.","13-Nov-2019"

The shoulder is too severe, making it unflattering and not very romantic. I also should have trusted another reviewer who mentioned they wished the sweater was either longer or shorter.

I loved the colors, however the fit was a little bigger/more casual than I would've liked. I also think it has been well loved/worn and has seen better days- the material was much thinner than I had anticipated, so it felt more like a long sleeve shirt, than sweatshirt in terms of warmth. When I did wear it, I got tons of compliments on it. I guess I was just looking for a slightly dressier version of this- would be perfect for a beach vacation or more spring/summer time weather.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tavia-mixed-plaid-cardigan?color=090","mo_on_the_go","Great Color","I love the colors. But the weight of this sweater is best for outdoor wear. Which means not great for a Minnesota winter. Probably would have been great on a cold fall afternoon. As others have said -- it's itchy and you will want long sleeps and a collar with coverage underneath.","10-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tavia-mixed-plaid-cardigan?color=090","Margo","Cute but itchy. Size down.","It took me all month to figure out how to wear this. I wanted it to look slouchy like it does on the model, but the fabric is kind of stiff- I think it would have been better to size down and have it be more fitted. It's also SUPER itchy. Don't fool yourself, the only way you will be able to wear this is with a long sleeve shirt underneath. It's warm, so better make it a thin long sleeve shirt and make sure you're not going anywhere that's warm. However, at the end of the month, I finally wore it out and I wish I had done so sooner. I ended up with a fun, granola/cat lady chic look. Also the pockets are great, my coworkers and I stuffed them with candy and snacks to get us through a long, boring meeting and no one noticed.","30-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/high-vista-cardigan?color=000","Joe","Just ok.","The fit it a little large, especially the sleeves. I wore it around the house as a robe to cozy up in. It fits a bit like a bathrobe, due to the sleeves being so wide. The material is super soft and I loved the colors!","4-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/high-vista-cardigan?color=000","Hannah_Livs","Good quality but too over-sized for me","This sweater is a really nice quality with beautiful chunky stitches and I love the color combo, but it was just a little too slouchy for me. I love over-sized clothing, I basically live in giant potato sack sweaters from October through March, but I just couldn't figure out how to style this without looking like I was wrapped in a giant blanket. Maybe sizing down would help. Luckily, I work from home, so it was perfect for me on weekdays with leggings when I don't really leave the house! A comfy cozy piece, but not a real style piece for me.","18-Dec-2019"
