"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alex-mini-dress?color=240","CMC90","Love!","I really liked this dress! I can between a 2-4 in some free people dress sizes and since this was the type that I could tell would be more form fitting in the stomach section, I went with a 4. It was slightly large in the top section but gave me the room in the bottom half that I wanted. I wore it to my birthday party and got many compliments! Definitely would recommend.","28-Feb-2020"

While I really wanted it to work, this pair of coveralls just didn't fit me the way I hoped it would. I have a long torso and short legs, and this wound up feeling really snug in the groin area and super long, even with the cropped length. The quality was really good, and I would have been happy with the style if it had fit correctly. One thing I do want to call out for my other utilitarian ladies – this pair of coveralls is button-front. It is SUPER cute, but having to undo and redo 10 buttons every time I had to use the bathroom the day I wore this pretty much convinced me not to wear it again.","23-Mar-2020"

I wore it with black tights and boots. The matching fabric belt really makes this skirt. The material is nice and heavy, so I was able to wear this out & about in the Minnesota winter. I sized down to a M to make sure the skirt sat how I wanted, high on my waist. The color is a little different than the photos, perhaps more of a grey-brown than grey, making it a bit difficult for me to put together a whole outfit. But overall, I loved having this skirt!","13-Feb-2020"

The jeans are super trendy and comfy (REALLY soft for jeans) but too big. I have a hard time with jeans because my waist is a lot smaller than my butt/thighs so I would size down. I am usually a 26 in Levis for reference but went for the 27 here because I didn't know how they would run. I will definitely opt for the 26 next time. They weren't too tight on the thighs and butt so I think a smaller size would've helped give them more shape on my body. These are the perfect item to rent from nuuly. Trendy and fun but maybe not a piece you would invest in.","24-Apr-2020"

Material was nice but seemed thinner/less expensive than what I'd expect for what this goes for in retail in terms of price. Also, while it did fit, it was a bit weird. I got a small (my normal size) and the sleeves were really long and the hem was really short in the front. I'm 5'2"" so the shortness wasn't that bad but anybody taller than me, it would fit more like a long crop.","14-Jan-2020"

Oh, and the straps are a great option if you don’t want to wear it as a tube top but make it harder to get on and off and they sometimes become loose and you have to maneuver your body to get them back on.

The straps fell out of the hooks ALL THE TIME, and it was so long on me I tripped at least 4 times a day when I wore it out with shoes (I'm 5'3). Definitely would take a sewing machine to it if I bought it. The material is really super sheer, which would make it perfect for hot days. I really dig this and am going to keep my eyes out for a sale. I don't think it's worth the money considering the strap situation.","3-Mar-2020"

The top fit fine so I think it was more about the cut and my body shape rather than the dress being too small. I was also not a fan of the polyester like fabric and there seemed to be a lot of it. I am 5'9 and the dress hit my ankles which was a perfect maxi length. I think if you have a flat stomach and are less curvy; more on the skinny side you would really like this.","18-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tailyn-crop-flare-jeans?color=092","erikajo","Sooo fun! But low waisted","These jeans are really cute! I got lots of compliments, but I am tall and want my belly button covered by the waist and these did not do that. They also run a bit big in size and stretch a lot. Overall, would recommend- especially if you like a lower rise.","17-Mar-2020"

That said, I'm usually an 8 in jeans, 29 as well. And this pair of 29s fit too loose.","24-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tailyn-crop-flare-jeans?color=092","EnBee","Odd fit","So cute on the model, but they hit at the most awkward point. Not quite ankle, but not quite full length either. I usually like mine ankle length or a bit shorter to show off booties or mules, but these were just off. Also, lower rise than I like, stiffer denim...just something off about them. Tried on, but never wore. Ordered up to 31 (usually 29) which was the right call. These are more rigid, v little stretch.","1-Feb-2020"

They run a bit large so I wasn't able to wear them more than a few times once they started to stretch out just a bit. If you're on the shorter side, like me, they don't fit quite like the photos, they ended up looking more like a regular flare jean that was just a bit shorter than floor length, still really cute though.","30-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/tailyn-crop-flare-jeans?color=092","lilpow","Super comfy jeans!!","I really loved the way these jeans felt. The material was super soft (for jeans) and I wore them on a 5 hour flight and was very comfortable! They were stretchy but definitely true to size. I washed them a few times and they got a little tight but because of the stretchy material they always fit. My legs are pretty small but they were def tight around my legs on the top not really like they are pictured on the model. Since they were a bit more fitted, the flare is a bit wider than pictured, nothing crazy. I would 100% rent these again and recommend them!","29-Jan-2020"

If you have a C or bigger chest and want to wear this jacket closed, you may want to find another jacket to rent. If the siZe was larger or they offered a size larger than a Large I would seriously have considered buying this item. I will wear it open and pretend that this is how it was made.

Overall it’s loose, Which I think it has to be because it has no stretch. Outside is soft, obvs, and inside is also soft, lined with jersey. I wore it casual, with jeans, but it could be dressed up. I think it would be hard to wear with a sweater, because it’s bulky, but was fine indoors in colder weather.","1-Apr-2020"

My complaints were with the fit. It was a little tight through the arms which kept it from being quite as comfortable as I wanted. The yoke also cuts across a larger bust in such a way that I felt a little pregnant. Glad I rented this one, but not one I would keep.","17-May-2020"

The pattern is cute and kinda folksy, and for me I like a loose a-line cut, but I think there’s just wayyy too much fabric at the bottom, it feels a little like a tent. If it was a little bit more fitted I’d consider buying, because I think the top collar is really flattering and I like the way the sleeves are folded up a lot! Overall a great lounging about piece but not sure it looks good enough to wear out, ha.","10-May-2020"

I rented the 6P on Nuuly but bought the regular size 4. I am 5’4” And preferred the length of the regular fit on me. Usually I like the petite fit; however, with this dress the arms and length felt too short in the petite. This is a dress I can see myself wearing many times dressed up or down. It makes me feel beautiful. I think it would look nice on any figure. I haven't worn it yet but have two upcoming events I plan on wearing it too. Can’t wait!","26-Feb-2020"

However, unless I received a really bizarre cut of this dress, the area from the waist to the horizontal stripe below the hips is significantly more fitted than the pictures make it out to be & it clings to my hips & booty in the most unflattering way. My fit issues with Maeve are normally bust related, so I’d argue that this one runs larger in the bust, smaller in the hips.

It's a perfect example of a dress that takes two seconds to throw on, but looks like you put a lot more thought into your outfit. All I added was a minimal gold necklace that looked pretty with the open neckline. I wore it as a daytime look, but with the right accessories, it could be night time appropriate! This dress showed a subtle hint of cleavage on me (bra size 36B), which was kind of a nice surprise, because at first glance it seems little conservative. My advice: Pair with a chunky-heeled pair of booties, and soft beach waves in your hair.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It's super comfortable and because it's so basic it's very easy to switch up its look. I wore it three different ways and it was incredible each time! I would have purchased but mine had a little stain on it. The only thing that could make this dress any better would be pockets!","26-Jan-2020"

Love how the one shoulder and cheetah pattern make it unique. The only problem is that this is very cropped, but based on the picture I did not think it was. The top is loose and short and does not look good untucked, but consequently since it is cropped, it does not stay tucked in very well.

I had to place the fabric off the shoulder - which was OK but then made it very difficult to move through the day! Obviously, this is a sacrifice we all make for off the shoulder garments... worth it though!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I ordered a Small and it seemed a bit too large/blousy for me, even tucked into high-waisted jeans. I could see this being great for taller, fuller women. The material is nice and the print is great.

Love how the one shoulder and cheetah pattern make it unique. The only problem is that this is very cropped, but based on the picture I did not think it was. The top is loose and short and does not look good untucked, but consequently since it is cropped, it does not stay tucked in very well. That is my only complaint otherwise its a really fun piece!","7-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/one-shoulder-leopard-blouse?color=015","BMJ12","Cute but not functional!","I thought this top was cute, but not super functional - in the picture, it shows the one shoulder on top of the model's actual shoulder, but I found that doing that made the garment look completely lopsided. I had to place the fabric off the shoulder - which was OK but then made it very difficult to move through the day! Obviously, this is a sacrifice we all make for off the shoulder garments... worth it though!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/one-shoulder-leopard-blouse?color=015","andria123","Too short","As some other reviews noted, this top is oddly short. Even with 9"" high rise jeans, it is too short so would untuck anytime I moved. Really liked it but unfortunately unable to wear.","4-Nov-2019"

As others have noted, the pockets are strangely placed and the inside of the pocket sometimes sticks out (this is hard to explain; trust me, it's problematic).

The tiny flecks of color are playful and the quality of the knit was good. However, I couldn't get past the unusual pockets - they started unnecessarily far back on the sweater and were made of an odd mesh that was visible either underneath or inside at all times. I have fairly broad shoulders so it also didn't quite fit like it appears on the model in the photo (another reason why I didn't wear it). Super bummed!","13-Mar-2020"

Looks cute with leggings, sweats and jeans. Colors are great, fabric comfortable and it has pockets. It does tend to fall off one of my shoulders, probably due to the weight of the sleeves, which is fine. The pocket liners showed at times which I didn't love.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ines-midi-dress?color=010","shopgirlpnw","more buttonholes please!","This dress is so cute! I love the print and open back. I knew I would be between sizes, (I'm Small on top & Med. on bottom) so I went with a Medium, hoping for a more roomy look. But, I found it to be a little too roomy in the chest; it gapped at the side boob too much (I'm a 34C). In messing around with it, it seemed like if I could have shortened the straps, to bring it up a little, it would have been workable. So, note to the designers: add additional buttonholes to the straps so they are adjustable next time, please :)","1-Mar-2020"

I find their sizing to be on the smaller side so I went with the L and it was super awesome in the stomach area but a little too loose on the sleeves so they kept falling down but I still loved it! I threw on an olive cropped jacket and red Puma's for work and felt amazing! It really slims you!","30-Jan-2020"

I wore the sleeves off the shoulder and folded the dress under to make it shorter and it looked so cute like that!","27-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/monet-midi-dress?color=060","acg117","Super flattering - so many compliments!","This dress is form fitting in the most flattering & comfortable way! The ruching allows for flexibility in the fabric and if you're smaller/larger in places it all blends well, thanks to the natural bunching that's deliberate in the style! I am a 24 waist and 26 hip/thigh so dresses and bottoms can be tough to wear off the hanger. While the S fit perfectly in the hip, it was a little big in the waist - but thanks to the ruching it still looked amazing. You can remove the puff sleeve layer from the shoulders but I thought the sleeves looked saggy without that extra lift. Overall the dress was so comfortable and perfect for a cocktail-attire event.","21-Jan-2020"

I'm all for a short skirt even a VERY short skirt but as a dress even the slightest movement made this dang near inappropriate. I ended up pairing it with a longer cardigan and moto boots to give the illusion of a little more length. I LOVE all the pieces from this line and just wish I could still get away with its exaggerated hemlines but at a leggy 5'8"" this pretty piece just showed too much of the cookie jar.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The color is just as vibrant in person. I wore this with jeans and matching lipstick. The fit is a bit off, and is my only complaint.

Just something sort of uniform-y about it? I think it's the subtle check pattern in the fabric, which isn't super visible online.

I read some reviews saying it doesn’t look flattering on short girls so thought I’d throw that out there","3-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/campfire-cozy-cardigan?color=012","mad","Cozy!!! a little high maintenance","This is a fuzzy warm hug, or a bathrobe you can wear outside the house. It adds a cozy, luxurious feeling to any outfit. It looks low-key fabulous. It also sheds quite a bit, pills quickly, and is hard to keep pristine white. So I love it and wear it a lot, but wouldn't buy it.","17-Mar-2020"

It was the softest material I've ever had for a cardigan. The over-sized amount was just right.","27-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/campfire-cozy-cardigan?color=012","inthenow","Almost too cozy","I loved putting this super soft caridgan on, but it felt a little too much like loungewear for me. I wore it around the house, but it never made the cut to wear out in the world.","24-Feb-2020"

The puff sleeves were really cute and not too puffy at all. The colors are really vibrant and the weight of the material is thick enough so that nothing shows through!","27-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/montreal-tee?color=018","caryn_e","A keeper","I actually bought this shirt; it was so comfy. I rated it true to size--although it's a little bit over-sized, I think that it's supposed to fit that way. At least I prefer it that way. If you wanted to go with a really tight look for whatever reason, I'd size down. It's vintage-y looking.","12-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/montreal-tee?color=018","Lalalauren","Lurveee this Shirt","Super comfy. I wore this constantly. The material is thin but super soft. You definitely cannot wear a dark bra underneath. Not totally form fitted. A slightly loose baseball style tee.","3-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/montreal-tee?color=018","foxfire","Softest Tee Ever","This is the softest thing I have ever touched in my life. I would marry this shirt if I could. I would turn every pillowcase into whatever material this shirt is made out of and then every sheet. I wish my couch was made out of this t-shirt. I wish my own skin was actually just this t-shirt. Writing this I started thinking about this shirt and was like, why am I not wearing it right now? It's so soft!","27-Feb-2020"

It was fine, but definitely not me - but if you like the one shoulder look, give it a try! True to size, I wouldn't recommend sizing down.","30-Mar-2020"

I would LOVE this in black - I got it as a going out top but never wore!","30-Jan-2020"
