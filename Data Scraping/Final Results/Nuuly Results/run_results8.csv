"https://www.nuuly.com/products/farm-rio-bosque-pleated-midi-skirt?color=038","grannysmith","Great Transition Skirt","I ordered this even though it seemed a bit Springy. I was the first person to wear it because it still had the tags on when I received. The print was so fun and I received many compliments. Even though I'm 5 ft. I liked the length on me. I however find the XS to fit looser through the waist. I think the thing I loved most was the jersey knit lining the skirt had. It made it so cozy and gave it a heavier weight making it a great transitional skirt.","21-Mar-2020"

They were great pants, but I decided not to compromise and just stuck with business on top, yoga on the bottom.","16-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/courtney-ponte-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=001","Em","Comfortable but not for me","I was hoping these would hold me in and highlight my small waist but it gave me more of an apple shape. Sad. They are super comfortable but definitely not cropped on my frame. I will say the fit smoothly and don't show every bump. I do think they would bag out after a couple wears. Seem great but just not right for my body or style.","16-Apr-2020"

They were flattering, but not too revealing. They were not super stylish or anything, something about them wasn’t that cool, but for work, they didn’t need to be. They were comfy.","30-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/courtney-ponte-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=001","emilymccutie","Not for my curves","I have curvy legs, and as soon as I tried these pants on I knew they weren't for me. The fabric is extremely stretchy and comfortable, however for my body shape this just made them form to my thighs which are extra thicc. I felt like the result was an unflattering silhouette so they never made it out of the house. I would recommend for athletic/slim builds!","16-Mar-2020"

I wore them constantly. They were comfortable with stretch but still had the structure needed for the high waist to look good with cropped shirts. Definitely adding this one to my wardrobe!","10-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/courtney-ponte-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=001","janakhoffman","Like Yoga Pants, But Better","I think these are now the comfiest pants that I own (yes, I bought them). They're super flatting, stretchy and way more appropriate to wear into work than athleisurewear. Anthropologie typically runs a bit large in sizing for me, so I chose the 00 and they fit well (I usually wear a 24).","7-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/courtney-ponte-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=001","yep","followed reviews but too tight.","Loved the feeling. Awesome stretch ponte, like a think ""bounce back"" exercise pant. Tried to use the reviews to get the right size but, sadly, these were too tight in the belly/waist. Don't know if another size would have fit better.","7-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/courtney-ponte-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=001","Hanniekins","Such great pants!","I loved these. I ordered a 14 but was delivered a 16 and I’m kind of glad. I have big thighs and since these are supposed to be wide legs, the 16 allowed them to skim my legs better than a 14 would have to get the look I wanted. I marked them as running a big small because of the thighs. The material is awesome - thick and stretchy, almost like a workout pants. I wore them with tucked in graphic tees and vans or dr martens. But they would easily be dressed up. First Nuuly rental I would consider buying","1-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/courtney-ponte-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=001","lauracaro","Easy and comfortable","I really like these- definitely considering buying them because they were so easy to pair with almost anything. They can be dressed up for work with a nice collared shirt or a sweater, but they also look cute with a graphic tee and a denim jacket. I'm tall and have a long torso and these came up nice and high rise on me, and were also a great length. They feel like yoga pants (but even more comfy because they aren't too tight!) - try them!","14-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/courtney-ponte-cropped-wide-leg-pants?color=001","alms633","So comfortable!","These pants were super comfortable and seemed like great quality but they ran big for me and the result was they were not flattering. They were also a bit too long for my taste—I’m 5’4” so right on the cusp of petite sizing, and wished I had ordered a petite in these.","14-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/balloon-sleeve-corduroy-belted-shirtdress?color=016","bananarama","Sized down and it was still huge","It was soft, but not soft enough that belting it made it any more cute. It was just huge all over. The only place it fit was the sleeve length. It was too long, there was just too much fabric, even the collar/neck was huge. I can see the potential for it to be cute, and the fabric is so soft & looks expensive! You need to be really tall and size it way way down, at least two sizes.","15-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/balloon-sleeve-corduroy-belted-shirtdress?color=016","shanferg","So big","Shoulders were a big problem with this for me. I just didn’t find it flattering. Maybe would be good with a different belt, I just didn’t have anything that would work and there was too much fabric for me to belt with the one provided with the dress .","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/balloon-sleeve-corduroy-belted-shirtdress?color=016","witheredandboney","So Special","I LOVED this dress! It was so soft, lightweight and comfortable I never wanted to take it off. I received so many compliments when wearing it, and came so close to buying it! Unfortunately the belt is the same velvety/corduroy fabric as the dress, and it wouldn’t stay fastened/tight against my body. When it loosened it looked unflattering, and I found myself constantly fixing it. I definitely see myself renting again though!","20-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/balloon-sleeve-corduroy-belted-shirtdress?color=016","BettyG","Very oversized","SIZE DOWN! However if you're smaller than a size 4 then it just won't look right.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/balloon-sleeve-corduroy-belted-shirtdress?color=016","JuliaUD","Odd fit","SO baggy, I really wanted this dress to work, but it looked like a potato sack on me. The slits on the side also would have made it too short to wear to work.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/balloon-sleeve-corduroy-belted-shirtdress?color=016","js7477","Huge!","I sized down from my normal size based on reviews, and the dress was still HUGE.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/balloon-sleeve-corduroy-belted-shirtdress?color=016","Natskiss","Cute in many different ways","Super soft and versatile. Definitely a bit oversized.

Makes the puff sleeves stand up great! But I found the top to be gaping on me (I'm a 27 waist + a 34C) & the vee neck to be too deep for work.

Wore it with a comfy sports bra (my go-to bra in quarantine!) and my 32D/34C boobs barely fit, so if you are busty, I really recommend sizing up. My partner said it was one of the most modern and well-tailored A-line dresses they'd ever seen, which was nice to hear because I was a little afraid of this cut and associate it with being a little girl a bit. Wore it with suede booties and a denim jacket to make it a bit more casual. 10/10 would order it again.","11-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flutter-sleeve-embroidered-mini-dress?color=009","sarah945","Gorgeous mini dress - if you're plus size up!!","Holy cow, was this the perfect day-to-night work dress. With black tights, it wasn't so short as to be unprofessional, and the floral embroidery garnered constant compliments. That said, I know how the high-fashion game goes, so I took an educated guess and sized up from my usual size 14W/16(straight sizing) to a 20W -- perfect choice! If you have a broad back, larger bust, or are curvier in general, size up, and then once more for good measure. This is stiff, unforgiving fabric put in a silhouette clearly designed with an athletic figure in mind. In spite of the design, it was incredibly flattering, something I find to be true with most ML pieces. Going up 2 sizes made it fitted in the bust and booty, but still gave a comfortable amount of wiggle room. Ignore the number on the tag and go for a fantastic look!","14-Apr-2020"

Cons: The button fly does nothing for a stomach that isn't flat, it's not as high of a rise as I would have liked (fit more like a mid rise on me, which caused a muffin top since it wasn't at my waist), very tight the first few wears, legs looked more like skinny jeans on me, which I don't wear.","26-Nov-2019"

I'm a size 29 in all Levi's jeans (which I wear regularly) so they fit as I guessed. They don't stretch too much, but after wearing a few times loosen out in the legs nicely. Length was a little off (since I have shorter legs) but I just cuffed them a few times to make them fit more appropriately and to add some flair. Wore them with sweaters and sneakers.","25-Nov-2019"

They fit perfectly, if not a bit snug. I might try the 25 in another wash just to compare. Regardless, these jeans are perf and I might just have to buy them.

These were very stiff with no give. Combined with buttons instead of zipper, they were just a little too tight on me. Otherwise, they are pretty nice. I thought the Wedgie fit would really accentuate my booty, but they weren't as good as similar jeans I own that have a little more stretch. I'll probably rent these again in another color, but I think I'll have to size up. Although larger size might be too loose on my thighs and butt :(","22-Feb-2020"

They’re great for a casual office or you can dress them up with a nice blouse (the denim treatment is dark, but nicely worn in certain places - none of that terrible “whiskering” which can still be part of some denim designs).

They’re great for a casual office or you can dress them up with a nice blouse (the denim treatment is dark, but nicely worn in certain places - none of that terrible “whiskering” which can still be part of some denim designs).

They fit perfectly, if not a bit snug. I might try the 25 in another wash just to compare. Regardless, these jeans are perf and I might just have to buy them.

I loved that they didn't go all the way up my mid-section, but sat at my natural waist. The denim fabric is less stretchy than many brands of jeans - which was uncomfortable at first, but I greatly appreciated the resiliency (kept it's fit rather than bag out after wearing for a few hours).

The 26 is too large in the waist, I can put my hand in the shape of a first in the back above my butt there's so much room. I want to buy these, so I'm hoping to get the 25 next month.","21-Mar-2020"

I am normally a solida 27"", but ordered a 28"". These fit my waist perfectly, and my thighs weren't trying to bust out. I paired with heeled booties, strappy heels, and some adidas sneaker and ball cap for a laid back look. Loved them. Bought a pair from Levis when they were on sale for the holidays.

They fit perfectly, if not a bit snug. I might try the 25 in another wash just to compare. Regardless, these jeans are perf and I might just have to buy them.

I got my usual 27 and they were tight, like “out of the dryer” feeling, but they became more comfortable after a few wears. The color is a brighter version of blue.

They were the perfect amount of baggy in my legs but the waist is what noticeably stretch out. I'd be interested to go down a size to see how they fit, but nervous about my legs.

I thought the Wedgie fit would really accentuate my booty, but they weren't as good as similar jeans I own that have a little more stretch. I'll probably rent these again in another color, but I think I'll have to size up. Although larger size might be too loose on my thighs and butt :(","22-Feb-2020"

I'm a size 29 in all Levi's jeans (which I wear regularly) so they fit as I guessed. They don't stretch too much, but after wearing a few times loosen out in the legs nicely. Length was a little off (since I have shorter legs) but I just cuffed them a few times to make them fit more appropriately and to add some flair. Wore them with sweaters and sneakers.","25-Nov-2019"

These jeans, though, have completely swayed me to go back. This style hugs all the right curves and fits in all the right places. I usually wear a 24 or 25 and opted for a 24 in the Wedgie. They fit perfectly, if not a bit snug. I might try the 25 in another wash just to compare. Regardless, these jeans are perf and I might just have to buy them. They're great with tees, sweaters, block heels and slip-on Vans. You can literally wear them with anything.","22-Oct-2019"

They're perfect for weekend wear (paired with t-shirts, etc). or casual work wear (paired with a button up & heels). They are like 3/4 length, but are great for spring, summer or fall in Colorado (where I live). I can't say enough good things about them.","28-Apr-2020"

I also have a long torso and this did not give a wedgie. The rope belt is already looking a bit worn/frayed/pilling unfortunately, but it is removable. The straps are snap closure at the shoulders with two different lengths available and there are also buttons on the left side that open like pants.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/carter-utility-overalls?color=030","KCS","Really Cute, But Not Petite on Top!","Ah, I so wish this had fit properly! This is really cute, and surprisingly comfortable for a denim without much stretch. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get it on, but it has side buttons to help with the hip area, which I appreciate as someone who's more of a 14W on the bottom. This was my wild card piece in my Nuuly, and I gambled on the petite because I'm petite on top - short-waisted, short arms and narrow shoulders. Unfortunately, this seems to only be petite in the rise and legs. I would have needed it at least three inches shorter in the straps, and they only adjust by about a half-inch with a snap in the front, unfortunately. If this had had an adjustable buckle strap, I could have made it work, but it wouldn't have sat right through the waist and hips. It's a super cute piece, I think it's just meant to be worn on a normal- or long-waisted body.","10-Mar-2020"

They fit me a little more fitted than some might wear them, but loose baggy overalls look terrible on me so the fit works great for me. If I could change anything, I'd add another snap option for the shoulder straps, as they were a little long on chest/shoulders. Petite might work, but sometimes that gets tight in the crotch area.","28-Feb-2020"

Thought I was going to love this dress but it ended up being weirdly baggy in all the wrong places. The bust was huge, almost stretched out, the sleeves were very long, and the waist tie wasn't super helpful in actually cinching in the waist. The overall effect of all these fit issues was that I kind of just looked like I was wearing a bathrobe around in public. Not a super great look.","14-Apr-2020"

When I wore it with a bigger sweater I just scrunched it down and I think this worked best. The pattern and material are really nice and I felt fashionable wearing it.

They are so flattering on my shape (hourglass-ish, smaller waist, bigger hips), but I'm having a hard time with the amount of fade in the thigh/butt area. It's pretty intense and more pronounced than I'm comfortable with, so these are not keepers for me. Fit-wise, I took my typical denim 31 in these -- they are rigid, but if your weight is more distributed in your hips/butt versus waist, you could likely stick with sizing up 1 size vs. 2.

For how expensive of a piece this is, the coat is THIN. I was surprised at how it felt like a simple layer, and not an actual substantial coat. Given the boxy and frumpy fit (looked like I borrowed an old coat of my dad's), I expected it to be thicker and actually substantial warmth-wise. Instead I was just all around disappointed because the fit doesn't make up for the lack of function. If you can find a way to style it like the model then go for it, but definitely size down and don't expect it to be tapered and feminine at all!","1-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/veronica-oversized-boyfriend-coat?color=008","KarenB","LOVED this coat","I really loved this coat. I was surprised it wasn't lined and expected it to be softer, given the cashmere content, but that said, I really loved wearing this coat. The over-sized style accommodated sweaters easily. It also had an interesting shape that added some style. It was a lot warmer than I thought it would be - but not hard-winter warm. On colder days I wore a vest underneath, as the coat does not button to the neck (they stop at chest level.) It went with everything and easily dressed up or down. It's more understated than some of the other ""wow"" coats on Nuuly, and if I could afford it, I would have bought it.","28-Mar-2020"
