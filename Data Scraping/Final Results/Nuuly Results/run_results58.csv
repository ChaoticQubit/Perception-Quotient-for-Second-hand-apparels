"https://www.nuuly.com/products/moving-mountains-pullover?color=072","lpet","A bit bulky","Unfortunately this shirt was oddly too bulky on, even though I love an oversized look. I think it's just that it made me feel disproportionate, with the weight of the fabric, and how it sits on the shoulders.

Looked great with jeans and I wore it over a black knit dress once (when I didn't want the bare shoulders for work).

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cold-ocean-sweater?color=011","kgrady","Cute","Loved this sweater, will probably rent it again in the spring. It definitely is large and grows alot when you wear so I did wash it after wearing to shrink it up so I could wear again.

I love how it's oversized (I am between a M and L and sized down to M, and there's still plenty of room, but liked the oversized look at that size) and so comfy! I typically wore with light wash jeans and sneakers or threw it over a top paired with leggings. I kept debating whether to purchase or not, but got nervous that my kids would get something on it since it's a light color. I will most likely rent this again because i love it!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I wore it WAY more than I thought I would. Ski lodge, couch, all-day leadership conference (casual dress obviously). The giant pockets were great and I loved the long zipper for “climate control”. I would keep it... but it’s white... and I’ll definitely ruin it. So I’ll let nuuly handle that :)","20-Jan-2020"

He ordered me several oversized pieces, including this one. The XS was so oversized, it made me look massive and wasn't the least bit flattering. I'm all for an oversized look, but this was a bit much. The sweater also looks like it's been worn/washed many times. For reference, I'm 5'7"" and currently 138 lbs.","2-Jan-2020"

It runs large, but that's what I was hoping for. I'm 5'11"" and I have long arms, and the arms on these were just perfect at a size M -- I might even rent again in a size L just to compare between the 2, because I honestly want to buy this and wore it almost every day!","13-Dec-2019"

I ordered a large because I assumed the oversized nature would be proportionate, but it resembles a small tent or poncho in size.

I was so excited I sprang for this in 90 degree July weather so I only got to wear it indoors once, but will definitely be renting this one again! Super soft material is a plus.

It's a great length and really comfortable, but also very cute. Really great summer dress and you can wear it to the beach, school, work or just around the city. Definitely recommend.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The material is lightweight, but there is a LOT of fabric in the skirt. It didn't hang on me the same way as the model, definitely more full and maxi-like (it came exactly to my ankles). The bias cut made it a little tricky to get the top situated, but once I tied the straps tighter it fit better.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sunrise-wanderer-mini-dress?color=011","RJ","Comfy and versatile","So I like how this dress could be an easy summer dress or fall layering piece. I thought the embroidery was festive so I chose this to layer with a dark red cardigan, ivory tights & knee boots for a more Christmassy look. The thing I didn't enjoy about this piece is that it has pockets. Usually, that's a plus. In this case, though, the lining of the dress ran sort of short and the dress fit my hips less loosely than a model. Couple these issues with bunchy pockets and I just didn't love the silhouette on me. I'm not sure anyone else could tell it padded my hips, but I didn't feel as confident as I could have without bunchy pockets.","14-Dec-2019"

The bottom half has a slip underneath which I'm thankful for because the bust area is 100% see through. You can see my back tattoo across the room its so thin. Also, the bottom is slightly fitted.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sunrise-wanderer-mini-dress?color=011","GG","Perfect summer dress!","Everything about this dress is near perfect. The embroidery and open back are beautiful, fun details, and the ruffle hem adds some nice movement when you walk. The bottom half of the dress is lined so you don't have to worry about any see-through issues, and because the back is pretty open I wore a simple nude bralette and felt like it didn't take away from the dress at all. I'm a little shorter and the dress hit right above my knees, and I liked not having to worry about the dress riding too high. It definitely runs a little big, but because it's shapeless and breezy you can totally get away with it fitting a little larger without losing the style or overall vibe. If that is something you're concerned about, though, definitely size down. This dress is for sure one of my favorites!","4-Aug-2019"

It’s not too short, but be aware you can’t really wear a regular bra with it because of the open back.

They are a very dark black and very comfy due to all the stretch in the material. The fit was larger than I expected and so I only wore them a few times because I was constantly pulling them up. But as I said, they were so comfortable and the stretch meant they mostly fit through my legs, so I wore them more than I thought I would after first trying them on. The dark black worked well for wearing them to work because they look more like pants than jeans (though I do have a casual workplace).","17-Dec-2019"

They're very versatile and incredibly well made. They have some sort of built in shape wear. Because of this, I could have sized down. They're a really rich black and went a little past my ankle, which is great in the colder weather. I highly recommend them, but consider sizing down.","16-Nov-2019"

Very low cut so I was definitely going to have to use fashion tape to keep things from getting too risqué (34DD for reference).

When it came in, due to my height(5'2) it fit more like a dress. I was actually pleasantly surprised! I wore this to run errands on one of the hottest days of the year and felt very put together but cool and comfortable while doing so. If you are expecting this to be a tunic and you are under 5'3' I would maybe not choose this item.

Everything about it was perfect other than the fit running a little small. The fabric is great quality, love all the detail.","24-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dominique-midi-dress?color=041","dturkeyyy","Gorgeous Cut & Fabric!","I wore this to a late August wedding in Connecticut. The dress is STUNNING on. The cut and elevated cotton-lace fabric was the right mix of sexy and classic. I am more of a size 4 on top, but on bottom can fit into anything from a 6 to an 8 - therefore decided to try the Medium which was perfect, just had to shimmy my hips into it a bit!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/skinny-mini-cardigan?color=031","Charlotte","Gorgeous color, nice slit detail","I was surprised by the sweater! In person it is much more Rich olive green than brown. I usually am between a small or medium depending how I was things to fit/hang. I wish I got this in a smaller size because it stretched out a bit as I wore it and it’s pretty long so a tighter fit would look better.

The wrists were much bigger than even the shoulder area. It was difficult to style/ not my style. The item I received also smelled strongly of someone else's perfume, maybe it was just too strong to come off in the wash, but that was disorienting and off-putting. It was my first time experiencing that with Nuuly, a possible doubt that an item wasn't fully clean. I wore this item a few times with leggings, on top of sports bras. It was fine for early spring weather in Texas. It was cute in selfies that didn't show the sleeves.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sundays-best-sweatshirt?color=014","CMC90","Love this, but sizing is odd","So I honestly LOVE this sweatshirt and if it weren’t so expensive I would buy it. However, it was pure luck that I ended up getting a size that fits me and I think the fit may be off for some people. I am short with a short torso and only wear high waisted jeans so this crop worked well for me. I would never normally get an XXS because that is in no way my size, but I had my eye on this one forever and it was the only size available so I thought I’d give it a try. It’s only slightly tight in the arms. But it’s cropped and the boxy fit worked because it was smaller than my normal size so it ended up fitting me closer to the body, which I liked. I might rent the XS next to see how that fits. (Normally I’m between a XS and small in free people and a small or medium in urban outfitters for reference)","22-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sundays-best-sweatshirt?color=014","SP","I’m a fan but be cautious of the fit","I didn’t have a issues with the shortness/crop of this sweater like the some of the other reviews stated. I always high-waist bottoms and I’m average height so it wasn’t an issue. The shoulders were a little too wide for my liking. FYI~The sweater slipped off my shoulders while I wore it. Be prepared for that wear a tank top under it, strapless bra, or bette yet order a size down. Overall, I’m happy with this sweater and got a lot of compliments.","13-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/yara-pocket-midi-dress?color=001","Heatha","Cute dress","This dress looks cute on but I did find that the fabric was different than I anticipated. It was sort of stiff and not soft t-shirt jersey fabric. The pockets were also in an awkward spot-much higher on my torso. This made them sort of unusable as they were basically right under my boobs. (I am also not tall so imagine the placement would be odder on someone who was taller than me.) Overall, it was a cute and flattering dress and people complimented me when I wore it.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

Dress Up or Down.","I really liked this style, so much so that I would consider renting it again in either white or black! It's a really good basic with a twist due to the ribbing detail in the fabric and the small ruffle detail at the sleeve. You can also dress it up or dress it down. I paired it with a flat sandal for work and white vans for the weekend. It does hug your curves, so I layered it with a seamless slip for work to feel a bit more comfortable.

Runs a little bit big - I typically wear a 10 and fit into a M comfortably. The only issue I had with this dress was that it’s very thin. You can see any underwear that you wear, but if you wear a thong the fabric will fall into your butt. So it was a little difficult to style for work.","26-Aug-2019"

I wore it for a day of wine tasting and was comfortable all day. However, you may need to wear spanx or other compression shorts underneath, like I did. The fabric wanted to cling to my tummy in a less than flattering way, so I wore shorts underneath which solved the static problem. Very cute, just be aware if you feel insecure about your midsection.","2-Dec-2019"

The body and sleeves of the dress fit well, I will say if you have a larger bust the flaps for the 'faux' wrap do not lay flat, they are shorter so the extra layer hits the bottom of your boobs and pops out.

I normally wear a 4 but the top didn’t come down all the way to my waist. And even the neck area with the buttons was kind of tight getting in.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/pocket-tunic?color=011","trangxnguyen11","Beautiful, Architectural/Artistic Feel","I absolutely LOVED this tunic and wore it so many times during the rental month. It was such a modern style, and I felt so fashion-forward every time I wore it. The only reason I gave it less than 5 stars is because I felt the tie made the shirt a bit awkward - in order to tighten it enough to cinch the waist a bit, it ended up pulling at the sides a little bit. I felt like the shirt may lose some of its structure after a couple more washes/weeks of wear.","13-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/pocket-tunic?color=011","Bee","Hard to wear with curves","The concept of this shirt is beautiful, but in reality I have trouble making it work. The fabric is luxe, thick, and soft with a combo of structure and stretch. I have a smaller waist and bigger hips, and the cut provided too much extra fabric for my shape when wrapped. If you look at the model pics, notice how the pockets kind of stick out below the belt. When you add hips under there it's very ""extra""! I also need a total of 3 shirts to make this appropriate work (cami under, cardi over). Would recommend for straighter-framed people to wear somewhere where you won't need any extra layers.","10-Nov-2019"

As with many of my nuuly picks, strangers commented on how cute the dress was. I wore this one to work, but could have dressed it down with some white sneakers for the weekend. Size wise, I went down one, so that it would not be too billowy. The tie in the back made the smaller size a perfect fit!","25-Sep-2019"

I think on the weekend it would be okay but not work appropriate. It has a nice shape with the dolman like sleeves and you can tie the waist to your liking. I bought an xs (usually a 4/6 in dresses) and I had more than enough room. Little too much room in the bust but it was manageable.","15-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/les-papillons-dress?color=049","Kezzerj","Comfortable and Easy","This is a pretty dress that is an easy 'throw on and go' piece that can be dressed up or down depending on your accessories. I also paired the orange Charlie Holiday blazer (included in my Nuuly box) with this dress to wear to work. I had read that the dress runs large, but I'm typically a size 10 and the M fit fine. It has a waist sash that can be tied in the front or the back, so that helps to adjust for sizing. It's a lightweight fabric, and was a little low cut for my preference so I wore a cami underneath.","26-Aug-2019"

I ordered a size down after reading reviews on the Anthro website, but even with that, the neckline was still far too low. I didn't want to not wear it, so I ended up wearing a tank top under it which was ok but I much would have preferred not to have to do that. If you have a smaller chest this might fit better, but I would definitely recommend sizing down.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It is a little low cut, but balanced by the sleeve so I thought it was perfect. The fabric is a perfect weight for summer, so comfortable, not too hot, not clingy.

Wore once but by the end of the day I couldn’t wait to take off! Smocking so itchy and I never get itchy from clothes","12-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/smocked-yoke-tank-top?color=060","Alli","Itchy around the neck","This style is pretty and the color is a very vibrant red. The material is very lightweight, so this is a good summer piece. The shirt is very flowy and forgiving. My only issue is that the high-neck was itchy and uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend this for a full work day and rather a few hours of wear.","25-Sep-2019"

The style is fun but the material gets wrinkled really easily (was very wrinkled when it arrived) and the material on the chest/neck was a bit itchy on me. Great color though","14-Sep-2019"

If your skin is sensitive, it may irritate your neck a bit, but I was able to get used to it enough to wear for a full work day, and I would wear again.","29-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/smocked-yoke-tank-top?color=060","Kerri","Amazing top","Color is beautiful, cut is flattering. Wore it with work pants and with cut off jeans. Super versatile. The neck line it a little irritating but easily ignored for how fab it made me feel.","9-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/smocked-yoke-tank-top?color=060","Kelley","Summer Turtle Neck","This top was so cute! My only qualm with it is that the ruching at the neck is extremely itchy. If you have any sensitivity on your neck, this may not be the shirt for you. Besides that, the fit is comfortable and goes great with a pair of jeans!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
