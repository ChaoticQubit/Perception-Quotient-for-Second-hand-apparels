"https://www.nuuly.com/products/shades-of-blue-midi?color=092","cgallagher716","So close...","I was so on the fence with this one - ended up only trying it on/not wearing it out. Love the denim/patchwork, but the shape was just not working on this pear body. Tried it with a tee under, a jacket over, belted, etc, but couldn't find the sweet spot. Mostly just looked like a sack. A cute sack though...","20-Feb-2020"

The billowy sleeves were a little overwhelming because I’m petite but the sleeves were cute rolled up higher on my arm. I sized up a size because I’m 6 months pregnant but I had more than enough room. I may order my true size next month and purchase it!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","strum","Maybe my mistake?","I wanted to like this, but there were two problems. The fabric, as others have mentioned, was low quality and very much meant for summer. Should have listened. Also, and this was 100% my fault, I got the petite thinking the length wouldn't matter too much, but it threw all the dimensions off. So word of caution, don't get the petite if you are not petite (duh).","17-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","dresses2spinin","So flattering","The silhouette of this dress is so flattering and also comfortable. I would have loved to buy it but would never spend that much (even the discounted price) on a casual cotton dress. Good choice to rent, though.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","Kat3","unfortunately waist issues","The fabric is a lovely lightweight wrinkled voile and the print is cute. On, me however, the waist was just too high. The belt accompanying the dress was not of the same quality and sat akimbo.","7-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","Lexid","Odd fit","This dress is not made for curvy girls-The buttons pulled at my bust and right at the crotch. I also have a rather small waist but could not even get the belt on on the biggest loop. Just overall not great for me.","26-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","Jewlz","Cute but wrinkly!","I feel like this dress was just fine? Fits well, just like the picture. I wore it to work a few times, but not out because it just didn't feel special enough, I think it's cause the fabric is a bit boring? It also wrinkles like crazy. It arrived wrinkled, and it had to iron it before every use because it somehow wrinkled up while just hanging in my closet.","8-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","stephlee11","Comfortable & easy","Really like this for everyday wear. Works with tall boots and a sweater/cardigan in colder weather also. A button fell off the first time I wore it, so that was a shame.","4-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","MSS","Okay","This dress was sent as an alternative in my box. The material was light and breezy, and definitely good for a summer dress. However, I live up north and couldn't find an occasion to wear it in November. The dress fit well, but I thought the belt was very small. It was uncomfortable to buckle.","9-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","Becster","Great Fall Transition- Belt is small","Great dress and I felt great in it, but the belt's smallest notch was just a bit too tight for comfort so I felt I was holding it all in all day long.","8-Oct-2019"

I wore this to work (twice), to dinner, to book club. I always felt very pulled together when wearing it. The sizing is a little weird. The top is pretty voluminous and the elastic waist seemed TTS (maybe a little generous), but the belt was tight.","26-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","Raykaygabe","Beautiful, Light-weight Dress","I loved this dress! It comes with a belt and small loops for them it to go through, as well as a lining that goes down to the knees. I have a smaller chest so was a little worried about a prior reviewers comment about it being big on top but had no issues and was able to just pull the extra down a bit.","11-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","Pamela","Easy breezy","This dress is made out of a lightweight fabric that makes it really fresh and easy to wear during hot days.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","Kim","Cute and comfortable","I loved this dress. It fit very well for me though the top could be a little large if you have a smaller chest. Usually I have the opposite problem so it was nice to find a button down style that fit so well. (Note: I also rented the Steele short version of this dress in red and found that one to run smaller than this one.)","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","silato","Beautiful but be sure you have a slip to wear!","The cut of this dress is beautiful. It’s hard to see in the pic, but it has a low drop ruffle well below the hip line. The fabric is incredibly lightweight/sheer and the lining is super short. I had to wear an additional slip to feel comfortable.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lidy-midi-dress?color=049","Charparty","Great dress!","I loved this dress! I got 2 compliments within 15 minutes of wearing it! My only wish is that it had pockets. But it’s a great dress and super wearable.","10-Aug-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","Margo","Too short to be practical","I reeeeeally wanted to like this dress. I had so many plans for it. Work, weddings, dates... I never wore it out of my house. It was already a bit too tight in the waist, and the sleeves were also way too long, so there were fit issues to begin with. But the length was so short it reminded me of things I haven't worn since middle school. I'm 5'2 so I'm not used to having this problem. I kept seeing the gorgeous color and fabric and trying to put it on- I tried tights, i tried tall boots, it was just to short to even leave the house in.","30-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","maia_v","Cute dress!","This dress was very fun and comfortable! I wore it two days in a row at Disney World. I said that it runs small because I am usually an XS in women's dresses and the S fit me perfectly. It is a little short, but I am tall and with tights it was fine. I chose to wear it without the attached sash. Cute dress! Recommended!","15-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","Snt13","Cute, but short and lots of fabric","Cute dress! Loved the color and the pattern on the fabric, but there was a lot of fabric. It kind of all flows together up top and can be bulky.","29-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","Jillybeaner1","Cute but....","Probably mostly my fault I didn’t get use or like this. Ran too short and too ruffle feeling to me. The reviews said short and I just missed it. However, this dress isn’t as ‘drapey’ as I thought...very cottony without knit or something that would allow the frills to hang as they should.","27-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","cameheretoball","I promise I'm not pregnant","This dress made me look 6 months pregnant. I'm fairly skinny/lean so this was unfortunate. Nice color to it but it just looked awfully frumpy and made me feel chubby.","24-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","leajay","Too big for petites","This dress fit me OK, but it was slightly too baggy and long. I felt like I looked a little too ""little house on the prairie"". If you're on the taller side this is probably a great pick for you though, as the material and details are really nice.","16-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","Judy","Beautiful color, too many ruffles","This dress was my take a risk item and unfortunately didn't work for me. It was mostly due to the dress not fitting than to any problem with the dress itself. I typically wear petite sizes and since this dress looked to be pretty short, thought I would give it a go. Unfortunately it just had too many ruffles for me and it overwhelmed my frame. The sleeves were way too long, although they are easy to adjust with the elastic band at the wrist. However, the ruffles at the shoulders stuck out too far past my shoulders and were just overall too much for me.","8-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","parisrose","Fit Not Quite Right","This dress is super cute and the color is amazing. Petite women may find the ruffles and looser top to be overwhelming, but I didn't mind the volume because the waist is cinched and the skirt doesn't flare out too much! The only thing I didn't love was the fit of the waist - it seems like it's cut a bit too short waisted (coming from someone short) and tends to ride up when you move your arms. The belt around the waist is also very loose, so it tends to line up unevenly with the elastic waist seam.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","cait","Very fun and very short","This is such a fun dress--I loved the sleeves, and how the ruffles carry over the back. It would be perfect for holiday parties. Now, when Nuuly says it's a MINI DRESS they are not exaggerating. Only took a star off because it's a little too short to wear to work. It if had been longer, I would have worn it more.","1-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","mrosecollins","Cute but Not the Best Quality","This was very cute, but the material was not great. It ran small, I am usually an XS, but small would have been better. Very short. Great color though!","1-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","Kylie","So SHORT","Loved this dress but like everyone is saying it runs so short! I'm 5'6 and only felt comfortable wearing it with tights. Even then, doing any movement other than light walking is not recommended as you will definitely flash someone. Besides that, the material is thick and a great transition piece for fall to winter as you can layer up or down. My favorte part of the whole dress was the sleeves! I also preferred wearing the tie in a knot at the side rather than a bow if you're looking for other ways to style it.","15-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","kelsey_chabot","Very short","This dress is cute but really short - to the point that I wasn’t even comfortable wearing it with tights.

I wore this to work with black leggings underneath and got lots of compliments. I will say that if you are flat chested like me, the waistband will tend to rise up because your boobs don’t fill up the top of the dress.","9-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","TifNork","SHORT dress","I love this dress. I wore it to my BIL's rehearsal dinner and got many compliments. I am only 5'3"" and this dress is short but not too short. I was going to order the xs but saw other comments that is short and the S was perfect. I also wore it to work one day and again, lots of compliments.","30-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","safire","Modern Renaissance","Just like the eyeshadow palette, this dress is classy, eye-catching, and memorable. I'm a huge fan of long-sleeved short dresses right now and this one is my favorite one I've worn by far. The fabric was a little thinner than I expected, but still very comfortable and high-quality. The ribbon around the waist was kept in place by two loops on either side of the waist of the dress that looked a little unseemly, but I didn't really care too much. I got tons of compliments on this dress and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to wear something unique but classic.","30-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","tiffanynapper","Such a pretty color!","Even though this dress has more ruffles than I usually wear (I'm petite so I have to be careful with too much of anything), I got SO many compliments on this dress!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","KindOfAPotato","Cute, but not for me.","I wanted to like this dress, but the top (where ruffles are on the shoulders) took so much adjusting to make it look OK. Then the back stuck out like wings. I have a pretty short torso, so that may have been a big part of the fit for me.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I have curves and a booty and this dress wasn’t made for that. If I really wanted to wear this dress out, it would have to be with dark tights or leggings underneath, but I still wouldn’t feel comfortable. If I lifted up my arms or bent over ever so slightly, you could see my butt. For non-curvy girls or petite ladies, this would look super cute and flattering on you. Not sure if sizing up would help my case.","27-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/alexandria-mini-dress?color=032","cljohnsonx","Beautiful Color and Detail","I looooove this dress, but based on prior reviews decided to go with a M when I'm typically between a M-L. I unfortunately wish I would have gotten a L. The dress fits, but as someone with a larger bottom area, it was too short to wear without tights comfortably. It's still pretty warm, so it won't work out for me this month. I definitely would order again in the future and size up to a L.","16-Sep-2019"

I tried wearing it as a dress once, but there isn't a fastener below the belt and I am more pear-shaped, so leggings were a must as it gaped in the front.

First of all, I should have sized down at least one size. This vest didn’t lay on me properly because I was swimming in it. Second, for it being so large, I was surprised at how short the belt was - it should have been at least 4” longer. Finally, the quality wasn’t worth the price tag. I wore this once and lost one of the buttons on it (and was not doing much physical activity). Wouldn’t closet again.","14-Nov-2019"

Instead, this is pure stretch fabric, like a body-con dress. The waist fit perfectly, but the belt seemed at least 2 sizes too small.

It wasn't tight enough to prevent me from wearing it, but I probably would have liked it more if I went up a size. One thing I really really love is the material.

I had a meatball sandwich for lunch and didn't like my profile afterward haha. It was big on top for me, and tight around the tummy (after lunch). But very festive for October!

I prefer the 14. Where I could wear the sleeves up on my shoulders or off my shoulders. Size 16 I could only wear off my shoulders. Hope to be able to purchase a size 14 eventually.

A little too wide, though, which caused it to gape out on the sides above the self-tie string belt. No worries, though, because that was covered by my black leather moto jacket. Tried this with ankle boots, but I wasn't feeling the contrast against my ghost-white legs so I switched to 2.5"" black cone-heel pumps.

My normal BDG size is 30, but I ordered these in a 31. At first they were so small on me. I could zip and button them but they were super tight and uncomfortable. However, I tried to purposely stretch them by pulling very hard on the waisband and hip area while having them on. I have to say, they stretched a lot, to the point where they are now completely comfortable when standing up. Sitting down is still a bit uncomfortable, but not terrible. So moral of the story is that these do stretch a lot with wear, but I think most people writing the reviews did not get a chance to wear them because they were too small. Frankly I just think it's very hard to get the fit right with 100% cotton rigid jeans, which is what these are.","29-Oct-2019"

Think more of a light gray & darker gray (rather than black & light gray.) This was a little dissapointing because I wanted them to be more of a stand out piece.

I listened to the reviews saying these were really tight. I tried the 33 (tag says W33?) and they were MASSIVE. Way way to big.. not sure what the W stands for either. I will maybe downsize but it seems like everyone is having difficulty with these pants that it would kind of be a waste of an item IMO. Either way the two toned is nice. I can’t really say much else because they were just to giant to even picture what they’d look like.","12-Sep-2019"

I have had good luck with BDG in the past, but these are super thick and stiff, absolutely ZERO stretch, extremely tiny around the waist, which I could barely button, and then super loose thighs. They looked extremely dorky on me. Bummed!","9-Sep-2019"

So asked for a 33 and it was far too big. The label said W33. I’m not sure if that means wide?? I know it does in shoes. Or Women’s size. I can’t remember if the 30 had a W in the size name. Maybe third try will be a charm? These are soo cute. I wish I could get one that fits.","6-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/two-tone-high-rise-slim-straight-jeans?color=009","Sara","Weird sizing","I like these jeans a lot but they're a strange cut. Usually jeans fit me tightly in the hip and thigh and are too loose in the waist - I had the opposite problem with these. The waist was so tiny I needed to use pliers to zip up the jeans, but they were roomy everywhere else. They also felt a little...crooked? Maybe it's because of the two tone construction but the zipper placket pulled to the right and didn't line up straight on my body. The rigid denim gave some over a few hours wearing them but the waist was still so tight and uncomfortable I didn't wear them again. Too bad because otherwise they're cute as hell.","24-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/two-tone-high-rise-slim-straight-jeans?color=009","Teslacoil","Too Small Going to Try Again!","The duo-tone on this is rad. I was unsure as to my jean sizing for this and it’s generally inconsistent across brands, so I don’t fault Nuuly. Some trial and error is going to happen. I’m going to try getting it again bigger and hope I get a size that fits. For reference I got the size 30 and I usually wear a US 8 in pants. It was tight in the waist and thighs, by butt fit just fine, everything around it was too tight though.","9-Aug-2019"

I have about 4 or so other BDG high-rise jeans in the same size that fit perfectly, but for some reason these ones were so SO tight in the waist that I could barely get the button closed. They still fit normally in the calves and thighs though.","8-Aug-2019"

I paired this with high-waisted skinny jeans- both black and blue, but also with shorts (during summer) as well. The sleeves do not work the best under a jacket, but do fit if you need another layer. This top is super versatile and I wore it comfortably in August summer humid heat, as well as during the cold winter.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The closure doesn't stay closed, so you'll definitely have to wear something underneath; not only because of risk of wardrobe malfunction, but also because IT'S SO ITCHY. The embroidery is not covered inside the blouse, so all that stitching is all up on your skin.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I have thin arms and found the elastic cuffs to be oddly tight. The v-neck has a hook enclosure but it always slipped undone, so I always had to layer it with a cami.

I paired it with a chambray shirt tied at the waist and light brown booties, but could do anything from a basic tee to a heavy sweater and tights.

Be aware when you rent that if you want it to fit ""tightly"" like the model photo, you may want to size down. I liked it a bit loose, though. I'm attaching a photo of the back of the top because I think this is the hardest part about it, albeit fine if you have a bandeau or a skin-toned tank to wear under. There is a lot of potential exposure on the back side. I loved it and wore it with a skirt as well as over jeans.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

Not my style, but if you're into it, this is exactly the shirt you think it is!","16-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","mageberk","Versatile Top","I'm not sure if this is black or dark navy, but I managed to wear it as both a number of times. Mostly with blue and black denim skinny jeans. I usually don't wear much color, but this was a nice little pop against basics/neutrals.","4-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","LM27","Fun and Versatile Casual Top","This shirt is super easy to throw on with jeans and sneakers for a cute weekend look. It definitely runs large, so size down if you are concerned, but I think it gives a comfy relaxed look! I love the pattern and this shirt was great for the vacation I wore it on.","7-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","cofrags","Fun, flowy floral","The fit/style of this top is sort of... trapese? I think that's what they call it. So it's big and roomy. I wore it mostly with faux suede, high waisted leggings, but also with some black crepe flared cropped pants. It's super cute. I got the Small since I knew it would be on the bigger side / plenty roomy. I'm 5'9"" and weigh 148lbs. I wouldn't call it cropped, but it's on the shorter side, hence probably best with mid to high waisted pants.","28-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","katie44","super comfortable and a great print!","I wore it to work a few times. Definitely a loose fit, but also makes it easy for days when you might be bloating. Super lightweight, great for work!","15-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","amelia","Loose but Cute","This top was very cute and appropriate for work. However, it is pretty loose and wide through the torso, so I didn't find the shape to be particularly flattering. Nice quality material and cute pattern though.","15-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","Maggie","So so cute! Just size down!","I get they're going for the oversized look here--but I'd size down 1-2 sizes. Got my true size (an XL) and ended up swapping for a medium which I love. I get so many compliments on this top!","9-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","Erinpsf","Little House on the Prairie - but not in a good way!","This top was super cute when I got it in the mail. The second I tried it on I couldn't help but laugh. It was huge and looked like a bad reject from Little House on the Prairie. I think the fit was just off. Love the idea and if it would have fit better it would have been super cute.","9-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","Kris","Love in butterflies","Wore it to the zoo with high waisted jeans and sandals. Sooo cute and comfy! I did have to wear a tank underneath bc the arm holes are really large; when I lifted my arms you could see all the goodies.","8-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","lilybillgoat","Adjustable","This was a surprise hit - it worked throwing it over a swimsuit with jean shorts and with dress pants for work stuff. It was really comfortable to wear and good quality","5-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","Kezzerj","Cute and versatile!","This is a cute top that drapes nicely. It's a little blousey, but that's the style and I wore my usual size medium. I wore it with jeans and a chucky necklace, as well as under a blazer with dress pants for work. It also looks cute with a cropped jacket to let the ruffles peek out in the back. The front is slightly shorter than the back. Easy and versatile! Recommended.","3-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","Alli","Beautiful style. Casual but cute!","This pattern is bright and beautiful and the fit is very comfortable. It was exactly what I expected from the description. I would say the only surprise was that the material was softer than I anticipated.","25-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","cole","Super cute - can wear anywhere","The fit is boxy and large, but somehow it still works. It moved around a bit when I wore it (the shirt kept creeping backwards so the v neck moved towards my chin during the day), but it was easy to readjust as needed. I got multiple compliments on the shirt. I wore it on the weekend with jeans and flats and to work with black pants and heels.","24-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","holliharsh","Weekend to Work and Back","Loved this top! Wore it multiple times and it was a great transition piece between the summer and fall seasons. I paired this top with black jeans with a denim jacket on cold days and my Doc Maarten's. Really easy to layer with this top or just by itself.","23-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mallory-ruffled-blouse?color=009","lizurso","Cute top, but oversized.","I recommend sizing down in this top. I'm busty, so I went with a large (I'm in between a med/large for reference). The large ended up being WAY too big. I easily could have worn a medium, maybe even a small. Very cute print and design, but size down 1 or 2 sizes.","13-Sep-2019"

It’s so flattering! The length is perfect, the sleeves are so comfortable, and I can unbutton the top button and still look professional.","10-Sep-2019"
