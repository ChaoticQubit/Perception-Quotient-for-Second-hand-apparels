I wore it to work with a wine colored vest and received ALOT of compliments. It fits true to size, but girls with larger chests, beware. Its a little tight fitting over the chest area where the lace is. Otherwise, gorgeous top!","15-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brush-strokes-sheer-blouse?color=090","tfmarron","Cute, Sheer, Funky Pattern","Liked this top a lot, wore it to work and got plenty of compliments. But the pattern sometimes caught my eye and I was sure it was a stain or something I had gotten on myself. Never was, but the pattern definitely has the optical illusion of such! Comfy and flowy but for sure pretty sheer. Not see through but very sheer. Also had a little high-low cut. Overall really cute!","7-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brush-strokes-sheer-blouse?color=090","Tippi","Cute Dress But Not For Large Chests","The colors are vibrant and the fabric is soft. It's sheer but not inappropriately so. My problem with it is the white embroidery which seems to restrict the top on someone like me with a large chest. If it wasn't there, or maybe placed a bit lower, it would have been perfect. Instead, it makes the shirt ride up.","7-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brush-strokes-sheer-blouse?color=090","LieselDiesel","Wanted to loved it but looked too peasanty.","The look of this top is cool and I even received a few compliments as it's definitely a piece that's different than what you see every day. What I didn't love about it was the color at the top. If you have fair skin, I would NOT recommend as it really washed me out and was not a flattering color at all. The top is also definitely sheer enough that you need something under it. If you're wearing it out for something like a dinner and you're more adventurous, you could probably get away with just a cute bralette. It's a cool top but wasn't a hit for me.","29-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brush-strokes-sheer-blouse?color=090","jilliang","Wanted to love it","I was so excited for this top, but only wore it once...I have broad shoulders and it fit fine, but the top half really wasn't flattering. And the sleeves were almost too puff for my liking- great material but I couldn't bring myself to wear it again.","28-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brush-strokes-sheer-blouse?color=090","Aimes","Beautiful","This top was beautiful but a little body and flowy for me. Would be great for someone who either filled it out or it draped over.","20-Oct-2019"

Flattering for curves!","I had to force myself to wear this because the weather is still a bit too worm for his piece. So glad I did. Its adorable. Very flattering, body-com fit. I wore a shaper underneath but didn't feel it was necessary if I wore a jacket with it (too hot out for that though!) Great fall piece with a cool 70s vibe.","26-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brush-strokes-sheer-blouse?color=090","Kristen","Really want to buy this shirt!","This was my favorite shirt from this month! I will probably buy it in the future. It says sheer and it was but not so sheer I had to wear anything under it. I loved that the sleeves were a statement without being just huge. Fit perfect.","24-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/brush-strokes-sheer-blouse?color=090","hdaredouglas","Beautiful blouse for any occasion","Perfect blouse for a cooler day.

I wore this with high-waisted denim shorts, white suede vans and giant gold hoops üòç felt so fun in that outfit. The top itself is very lightweight and smooth on your skin and tucks in perfectly to high-waisted bottoms, which I didn‚Äôt know was something I wanted till this shirt came in.

Its a thick material so would be fairly warm if paired with a jacket + tights. The black areas are metallic so it looks fancy. I plan to layer this over a black long sleeve T. Due to reviews that said it was too long, I ordered a petite in a size up and it worked perfect for me at 5'6"". Just above the knee.","10-Nov-2019"

The fabric is thicker than I thought it would be and wasn't as see-through as I had anticipated. Keep in mind that the pink is much brighter than the picture reflects and that the white is more of an ecru, not true white. For someone short, I'm 5"", the dress went to about my knees and the sleeves hit at my wrist.

I wore it to work with a slip underneath because I was worried it might be a little transparent. I got compliments from people I've never spoken to before. It has a very pretty cut to it, very flattering and feminine. It is pretty thick and heavy as well, which was nice as it was sturdy. I can go between an XS, S, or even a M depending on the brand and fit of clothing, and this in an XS fit me well, and not too tight at all.","17-Sep-2019"

Unbuttoned, the collar was so wide that it covered my entire chest and would flap around when walking and it tented a lot in the back. Buttoned up it was better but sat very oddly on my body shape.

I also thought it looked weird without a belt, so all those things considered I put it right back in my nuuly to sit for the month. it was a bummer since I chose it for a specific event, but since I was happy with my 5 other items I was satisfied. this one was just a miss.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I dont like tops where the seams are on the outside aand did not realize this from the model pictures. The neck hole is floppy and the tag is weirdly placed so you don't know which way is right side out. and there's this string on the back of the neck to keep the top on your shoulders but you could see the string while you were wearing it (ugh). this is the most confusing top i've ever worn. would not recommend.","11-May-2020"

In the beginning, I was wary of ordering it because of some of the reviews, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. I do understand where some of the complaints were coming from and I can be fully transparent about the fact that the neck is strange... it's like half a cowl neck and half mock turtle neck? So it falls off your shoulders really easily which can truthfully get annoying. But if you wear a bralette or tank top under and you're okay having that ""shoulder poking out look"" then it's totally fine. Also, the first day I wore it, when I get home I thought maybe I'd worn it inside out, but that's just the stitching. Anyways, I still really like this sweater, especially the length because it fully covers my butt achieving the perfect oversized look.","26-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/main-squeeze-hacci-top?color=040","gabriellaamour","Huge and confusing","This top was extremely confusing. The neckline was difficult to figure out.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/main-squeeze-hacci-top?color=001","padthaiprincess","one star for the color","The bright blue is beautiful but I absolutely despised this top. When I first pulled it out of my nuuly, it was wrong side out. I couldnt figure out which way to wear it (tip: it's with the seams on the outside). I dont like tops where the seams are on the outside aand did not realize this from the model pictures. The neck hole is floppy and the tag is weirdly placed so you don't know which way is right side out. and there's this string on the back of the neck to keep the top on your shoulders but you could see the string while you were wearing it (ugh). this is the most confusing top i've ever worn. would not recommend.","11-May-2020"

It is still a little loose but not overly baggy. Got this as my 6th item to add some color to my everyday. It's very casual and some of the edges are unfinished. I work in a casual office so I wore it to work and it was ok. Not a bad rental, but not a great one. The only issue is that the tag hangs out in the back so I have to wear my hair down to hide it.","9-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/main-squeeze-hacci-top?color=001","mcfoster104","Soo soft and nice oversized look!","This sweater is so soft and I'm gunna buy it rather than returning it! In the beginning, I was wary of ordering it because of some of the reviews, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. I do understand where some of the complaints were coming from and I can be fully transparent about the fact that the neck is strange... it's like half a cowl neck and half mock turtle neck? So it falls off your shoulders really easily which can truthfully get annoying. But if you wear a bralette or tank top under and you're okay having that ""shoulder poking out look"" then it's totally fine. Also, the first day I wore it, when I get home I thought maybe I'd worn it inside out, but that's just the stitching. Anyways, I still really like this sweater, especially the length because it fully covers my butt achieving the perfect oversized look.","26-Dec-2019"

The fabric was too flimsy, it hardly did anything to make me feel warmer, and the fit was too big and long. I know it's supposed to be a baggy fit, but this jacket felt like it wasn't really holding on to any part of my body because it was so wide.

I think the stiffness of the material also contributes to the sweater looking very boxy","12-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/favorite-teddy-pullover?color=066","SlipnSlide","Short Arms","I REALLY wanted to love this (and I was sooo close) but the sleeves were about an inch too short.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/favorite-teddy-pullover?color=066","Maryc","Interesting","I obviously didn‚Äôt read the details to see the lining was a faux suede but I did see a reviewer mention it was not soft inside. I was surprised when I went to try it on and I was nervous it was real leather until I read that it was faux to my relief. I think this just contradicts the whole comfort level of the sweater. It‚Äôs not as comfy cozy as it looks. It feels cold when you put it on and the lining makes it a little stiff. It is DEFINITELY boxy and my friend said I looked like Hans and Franz from SNL though ‚Äúcute‚Äù. I did actually get some compliments! Sleeves were a weird length and ran a little short. This was not a complete loss but just an okay sweatshirt.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/favorite-teddy-pullover?color=066","cassc","Great colorway and fabric, strange sleeve-length.","I didn't wear this because the sleeves were strangely short or stopped at a weird point on my arm e.g. before the wrist, and since they are oversized, looked very strange. Maybe they shrunk up with washing? Needless to say it didn't look like the picture on me, but loved the color and interesting texture.","7-Oct-2019"

If you are bigger in the chest, it will definitely pull if you try and button it. Because of where the belt sits, though, it looks strange unbuttoned, even if you take the belt/ribbon away. The velvet wasn't fantastic quality, and even gently using my steamer, the cuffs and lapels never quite sat right. If you're desperate to try a velvet blazer, it's worth a shot.

So, I really DID just use it as a bathrobe in the mornings. I wore nothing under it except my skin - and it felt wonderful!

I have a flat chest and no matter how tightly I wrapped the dress, the chest was still gaping widely. The waist portion is cut much smaller than the fabric for the chest (I have a tiny waist). Maybe this dress only works for moderate breast sizes, after looking at other reviews. Also at my height the back hem (hi-low) was trailing on the ground by 2 inches, would need heels. It was ok for work from home glamour because of the awesome print, but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this outside.","4-Apr-2020"

I don't know if it's not a great fit for hourglass shapes or what, but my chest was REALLY exposed and it didn't tie or wrap properly.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/moroccan-moment-maxi?color=000","Wendfish","Flattering","I wore it to my office holiday party, though I had the same issues others did - even pinned at the neckline, it gaped open. The folded flap inside the neckline wouldn't stay flat, even with pressing. I wore tights under it to avoid too much leg showing. And I had to have a coworker tie the arm bows into double knots to avoid getting into food (and even then I was super careful). They did come undone otherwise because the material is slippery. It was flattering, but a bit high maintenance to get it to work for me. I did get a lot of compliments on it.","16-Dec-2019"

Only drawback were that eating was a delicate matter with the sleeve bows and it ran a tiny bit small. As it's a true wrap dress with a slit, if you have an hourglass shape, I'd suggest sizing up. I was able to pin the top so it wasn't too low with little problem, and I just had to keep an eye on the slit to make sure I didn't have any wardrobe mishaps, but a size larger would've been more comfortable. Despite that, got so many compliment and the interesting print did a great job distracting from any small fit issues!","6-Nov-2019"

The waistband was loose, so it was sitting much lower on the hips than pictured. (I wear a 23 normally and had the XXS petite.) The fit issue was exacerbated by the fact that the skirt is surprisingly heavy, so the weight of the fabric was pulling it down further. Fit aside, I'm not sure I like the fabric weight, but I gave it three stars because it still has the potential to be a nice, simple skirt if it fit properly.","16-Sep-2019"

The skirt is a knit material, and while it's really thick it doesn't have much structure to it. I have wide hips and it felt like instead of skimming over this part of my body, the skirt held onto every lump and bump. I did wear it once because the color really is lovely and I think the skirt is a lot of fun, but I couldn't get over feeling insecure about how my hips/tummy looked all day.

I did not end up wearing these because the fit is so uncomfortable. The back pockets of the pants are ‚Äúfake‚Äù but they still have a lot of material bunched up where the back pocket seams are. It feels very uncomfortable to wear.","3-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/high-rise-skinny-corduroy-jeans?color=061","living59","Runs pretty big - still cute though","These pants ran really big in the waist/hip. I know other reviewers said the same thing. I wore them a lot even though I had to pull up on them constantly. Pretty comfortable aside from recalled large waist. I usually wear a 27 or 28 and I went with a 27 but I bet I could have done 26 or even 25. I always need Talls in pants, which is why I didn‚Äôt go down to a 26 (the calves are usually tight because they hit in a weird spot). Anyway, whatever size you are usually, go down one and you‚Äôll be much happier.","2-Jan-2020"

Amazing color and the fabric is butter soft, but with tons of stretch. I love how they look fitted but don't feel fitted (tight). They are actually super roomy (which is comfortable) but they don't look roomy/dumpy - they look form fitting and are super flattering. Can't recommend these enough.","22-Nov-2019"

Nice and stretchy to fit my more athletic legs, but I think more appropriate for someone who needs more room in the mid-section.

I usually wear a 27 or 28 and I went with a 27 but I bet I could have done 26 or even 25. I always need Talls in pants, which is why I didn‚Äôt go down to a 26 (the calves are usually tight because they hit in a weird spot).

They didn't fit perfectly, so I probably would have never bought them had I tried them on at a store, but they worked well enough that I wore them weekly while I had them. I tiny bit snug in the leg.

If these were just a tad bit higher waisted I would have bought them in every color they came in. They're 70s vibe, they neeeeeeeeed that high waist.

Also, have a tiny bit of a tummy from my c-section and these pants totally concealed that so I wasn't concerned about it at all--and I tucked my shirt in.

Even though I knew mustard complimented a lot of colors, they've still exceeded my expectations. I can style them to celebrate my inner hippie on the weekends and achieve business casual status during the workweek. They're super comfortable and the flare is wide enough to achieve that 70's feel without being over-the-top. Also, the high-waist is truly high enough and I have a longer torso even though I'm 5'5''.

I just got them a couple days ago and have only worn them once, but wore them to a concert and they were super comfortable to move around and dance in. They are definitely baggy, so if you like tight clothing these aren't the pants for you. I rolled these up a little bit but they technically fit me perfectly lengthwise. I wore a cute crop top with these and they looked great! I will definitely be wearing them a lot this month!","1-Nov-2019"

They were baggy but didn‚Äôt look sloppy. The cinched waist and buttons gave a cute style. Great pants!","21-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/margate-pleated-trousers?color=016","lemon14","comfy & cute","I‚Äôve never worn pants like these before and I really loved them. I wear them high waisted and it‚Äôs a good fit. One day I wore it with a crop top and another day with a big sweater. I felt super comfortable in them. The only thing I wish they had were pockets.","14-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/margate-pleated-trousers?color=016","ethorpe","cute but baggy!","These are classic Free People sizing - true to size in some places but totally far off in others. They fit my hips and waist like I'd expect but had SO much room in the crotch and butt that I found them unflattering and never wore them out. Bummer!","29-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/margate-pleated-trousers?color=016","kurds","Amazing material, causal look, super comfy","I love these! however the only downside is that they run extremely big. I got an xs and could have fit in a xxxs","27-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/margate-pleated-trousers?color=016","CJ","Thick fabric, Runs baggy!","Thicker fabric than appears, which some could like! I found them to be much too baggy to wear in public as a petite wearer!","10-Sep-2019"

Disappointed, since it fit really well everywhere else, but would be impossible to wear with a bra, and pornographic to wear with out a bra. womp womp.","11-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dallas-plunging-v-neck-midi?color=049","kfoydcbmore","Super flattering for small chest","I adore this dress! It's so easy to throw on (stretchy!) but INSTANTLY looks chic, polished, and cool. I'm an A cup and the dress accentuated my chest in ways that most pieces don't. It also has pockets! Hard to part with this one, might be looking to keep it.","4-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dallas-plunging-v-neck-midi?color=049","Californiagorl","Love it!","This is a great dress. Super soft and flowy and very flattering. Highlights my waist while hiding my tummy very well. The only thing is that it's so low cut I could never wear it without a tank top underneath but otherwise it's the perfect dress so I bought it! I am going to get it hemmed though. It's basically a maxi dress on me and I prefer for it to hit mid-calf.","18-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dallas-plunging-v-neck-midi?color=049","JBReis","Perfect Fit, Bought IT!","The deep V is super low so might not work for larger breasts. I am kind of small chested and wore a little Free People bralette under it for a little extra coverage. But LOVE this dress and the pockets are SUPER cute!","17-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dallas-plunging-v-neck-midi?color=049","KHopkins","Adorable summer spring dress","Thin material and a deep v. Super cute for walking around Savannah in the fall. Loved it. Added a jean jacket if Cold","21-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dallas-plunging-v-neck-midi?color=049","Wendfish","Too wide","Another dress that i think is too wide in the skirt due to pockets. If the skirt were just a bit slimmer, it would have looked better, but it made my bottom half look way too big! And the high waist didn't help to narrow it out, in fact it may have made it worse. Frankly, I looked a bit pregnant in it. Sad because I really like the top half","11-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dallas-plunging-v-neck-midi?color=049","tiffanyferg","perfect flowy midi dress!","Really enjoyed this dress! I wore during a weekend trip to New Orleans -- it was perfect for the warmer, humid weather. Great on its own or paired with a jean jacket. I'm 5'3 so it almost reached my ankles but I still loved how it looked.","29-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dallas-plunging-v-neck-midi?color=049","funkybanana","Fun dress - but very low cut","Loved this dress - but had to wear a tank top with it every time. Would have worn it without a tank top on a date night or something, but definitely not during the day / at work. Other than that - it fit great and I loved wearing it!","29-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dallas-plunging-v-neck-midi?color=049","Sara","Cute, comfy, very low cut","When they say PLUNGING v-neck they are not lying. It was a lot lower neckline than I anticipated from the pics but it looked cute with a lacy bralette. The dress is a comfy lightweight cotton with a little bit of stretch and it has POCKETS - it was perfect for a hot summer day in San Francisco. I was concerned the waistline looked a little maternit-esque but everyone who saw me in the dress loved it. If you have ample boobs just keep in mind they will be highlighted in this dress!","3-Oct-2019"
