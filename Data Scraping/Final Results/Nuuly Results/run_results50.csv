"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","mssfromnd","Easy top to dress up or dress down","This was a great top that I could both dress up and dress down which was a nice change of pace for me. I could wear it both at home or going to work.","7-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","LesaleeF","Quality construction","Quality construction and detailing. I like the fit on the top but it does widen a little too much at the bottom, making your midsection look larger than it is. That being said, it is still something I would wear to work in the Spring, under a cardigan.","29-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","ewallace","Loved the color but not the cut","This was really boxy and may have been a size too large for me. I really wanted to wear it and tried to make it work many times but never found something that paired well.","13-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","TXC","Cute top","Cute too and can dress up jeans","14-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","SheyShine","The shirt is very pretty and amazing quality.","The shirt is true to size. I ordered up to a size 3X, due to having a larger chest and this was my first box with Nuuly. Totally order to your size. It wasn't my favorite but only due to my skin tune. Im pretty rosey and this made more so.","7-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","JBig","4 seasons top","Nice weight to the lace. Structured nicely, although difficult to tuck in all around—nicely tucked just to the front. Great for work and layering.","6-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","plantlady221","do not size up","I cross-checked the size guide on this brand's website, and the size chart showed that I should be a large. Normally I go back and forth between medium and large, so I went with the large but it was way too big.","3-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","Arbee","My mom liked it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","Worked well for a Christmas party, but couldn’t get it to work in a more casual, everyday way with jeans like the model.","29-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","Aliciabug","Bell shaped at the bottom","This didn't fit my body well. I am a XS and it was just too big.","17-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","britmlewis","Too boxy and big","I tried this one and attempted to style like the model, but it was just too long and bulky for my 5'2 frame. The material is also pretty thick. It's nice quality but would definitely do better on someone with a larger torso (and I'd also size down).","26-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","Abbey","Boxy","I liked it, but ultimately, it was too boxy for my taste. A bit too stiff to tuck into pants and make it look less boxy.","7-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","melodyoctoghost","Bold lace, not too delicate","Lace can be tricky - sometimes, it's too delicate or fine, but that's not the case with this top. It's a strong, well-made top with a soft breathable lining. Definitely on the more buttoned up professional side. Fit as expected.","2-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","mamatryingtobechic","Runs narrow / more fitted than appears in pics","this is more fitted than it appears in the pics but lace and color are pretty ... just didn't work for me","23-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","Sf","Beautiful Lace","Great top. Wore for work under a blazer but could be dressed up or down. Heavy fabric but was good for fall weather.","18-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","ashday","A bit snug, but fine","I like the pattern, but found the fit to be a bit boxy. It didn't want to be partially tucked into jeans as much as I wanted that for the shirt. I found it to be a tad unflattering on my petite, curvy figure but the fabric and color are lovely.","11-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/lourdes-lace-top?color=060","BrooklynMom","Great quality lace top","I appreciated that this wasn't a cheapy lace top. It's nice, quality material, not sheer at all, in a rich color. Looks dressy with black pants or it can dress up jeans.","28-Aug-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/reed-tie-dyed-sheer-peasant-blouse?color=059","popoki","cute; more sheer than photo","This is a great every day blouse. The top fit well under the arms, but the keyhole on the front was much lower on me than in the photo. The shirt is also very sheer, and has to be worn with a camisole (unlike the photo, where it looks more opaque). Otherwise, a cute blouse!","7-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/reed-tie-dyed-sheer-peasant-blouse?color=059","Kathrine00021","Gorgeous colorful peasant blouse","I fell in love immediately with the gorgeous tie dye colors of this top.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/reed-tie-dyed-sheer-peasant-blouse?color=059","Staco","Gorgeous, sheer","Wore with jeans to a wine night. It kept sliding down when i was sitting on the couch and showing my bra, which was semi-annoying to constantly adjust, but maybe i should have tied the strings. =) Really pretty blouse, not soft but sheer","15-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/reed-tie-dyed-sheer-peasant-blouse?color=059","rebekah","Cute flowy top","Love th fabric and print, but found it a little overwhelming on my frame.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruby-flutter-sleeve-top?color=090","jmb","Not for me","Not right for me, tried it on but never wore it. It was roomy, with the stretch I wish i had sized down so it was more fitted. The sleeve opening wasn’t flattering on my arms.","8-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruby-flutter-sleeve-top?color=090","Marley","Love the pattern. The sleeves are a little awkward though.","Colorful sweater, with nice vintage look. Had to wear it tucked in because otherwise it would have been too loose around the bottom. It looks good tucked in though. The main weakness was that the sleeves aren't really that cute/flattering. I solved this by safety pinning the tops of them together just about two centimeters more than they are, which made them hang a little better.","31-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruby-flutter-sleeve-top?color=090","kg","Heavy sweater material","I loved the pattern and I really wanted this to work but the heavy sweater material was strange in a sleeveless top. And I wasn't able to pair the flutter sleeves with a cardigan or jacket.","16-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruby-flutter-sleeve-top?color=090","bigblueknome","Comfy, cute colors, not totally flattering","I ordered a small and was initially super thrilled when I first put it on, but then I saw photos of myself. Maybe it's just my body, but I didn't feel super flattered in this top. This would probably look super cute on a very thin person with small arms (like me 10 years ago). I did adore the fabric and it was super soft and cozy. It was something about the flutter sleeves that just seemed to add bulk to my frame. I still like it though.","2-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruby-flutter-sleeve-top?color=090","Bemigh","Just pattern","Liked it - but the flutter sleeves made it hard to wear in the cold. They were too bulky to wear a jacket or sweater over.","2-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruby-flutter-sleeve-top?color=090","Frenchfry","Cute, soft","I like the pattern and the feel of the sweater. The only thing that I wasn't sure about were the flutter sleeves. They are not very flattering.","29-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruby-flutter-sleeve-top?color=090","Kmhodom","So fun and great transition to fall","I wore this to work and got many compliments. The material is a light weight sweater but still wasn’t too warm to wear in the Deep South in September/October.","11-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruby-flutter-sleeve-top?color=090","clarekhogan","Versatile, soft top!","This is a great top! Super soft and easy to dress up for work or dress down with some jeans for the weekend. The sleeves are definitely pretty short, more of a sleeveless top than a short-sleeve, but very cute and comfy","6-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruby-flutter-sleeve-top?color=090","WWHeatherWear","Pretty sweater, but limiting","This sweater is super soft and the colors are beautiful. My only issue was that there is a lot of fabric under the arms making it impossible to layer a jacket on top.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/angelica-dip-dye-kimono?color=030","LazyLady","Great as a coverup","Wore this over a swimsuit at a resort and it worked perfectly. Beautiful colors, lightweight fabric. I didn’t wear it as regular clothing (as styled in photos) but I could see it looking super cute with white jeans as well.","5-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-jacket?color=031","PhojoAmy","Rented too early","Will definitely be renting again, maybe purchasing. Rented a bit too early and the weather I live in is still too cold for this jacket. It is a bit also fitted for a heavy sweater so even though I loved did not get to wear. Really cute and special.","21-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-jacket?color=031","PhojoAmy","If you don't like ordinary","Love this jacket. So unique and funky, like a great vintage find. It is the middle of winter where I live so I didn't get to wear it much. It fit but left very little room for a sweater underneath. I may keep to replace my boring jean jacket or try the x-large in my next nuuly.","20-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-jacket?color=031","aelloyd","Too busy","It's a lovely jacket, well-made. But I should've listened to the review that said the collar of the jacket (that you can't see in the pictures) makes it a little too much going on. I really wanted to like it, but just didn't work for me.","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-jacket?color=031","Pretje","Unique and beautiful!","I wore this with a black mini skirt, black tights and boots over the holidays.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-jacket?color=031","Amylovesclothes","Unique coat","I rented this for my daughter. She is a dancer in the nutcracker and I thought it would be fun for her to wear it to and from practices and shows. It's very costumy. I can't think where it could be worn in real life","16-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-jacket?color=031","Jae","Lots of compliments","I loved this piece — beautiful colors and easy to style. One note: I never buttoned it bc it looked awkward. A little too heavy looking over my chest. Otherwise, wonderful. Considered buying, but may just rent again.","23-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-jacket?color=031","GrrrlFriday","A real compliment-generator","I loved wearing this jacket and it made me feel like a badass. I got tons of compliments on it every time I wore it, and it kept me nice and warm in colder temps. It was hard sending this one back!","28-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-jacket?color=031","Cathie","Stone wash is too much","I hadn’t realized quite how strong the stone (or is it acid??) wash effect was. When you combine that with the epaulets and buttons etc it was a bit much for me. Didn’t wear.","27-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/naomi-jacket?color=031","Lastrange","Ill-fitting","The sleeves are weird in relation to the fit in the waist. The trim and neckline looked really worn and kinked up. Made it not lay right. Cool embellishments tho. I left this in the box for the entire month. It’s a hard No for me","14-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","garrett","Cute but Baggy","Very comfortable but extremely baggy top. Falls off the shoulder a bit but great for an oversized casual top.","19-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","Mmcgurk","Great Versatile Top!","Loved this top so much I ended up keeping it! I am normally in between a M and L and went with a M based on other reviews and it fit perfectly. The slit in front is pretty low in front so be prepared to wear a tank under or a cute bralette if you are well endowed. Love that I can dress it up for work or utilize it for a night out.","19-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","ekimkim03","My favorite pick!","I don't know why, but I just adored this top! It was slouchy, and I could wear it with jeans/booties or with athleisure leggings/dad tennis shoes. I typically wear a large, and I sized down based on the reviews. It is a bit on the shorter side, and be careful when bending over... you might give a show to whoever is looking ha! But I really loved it overall!!","12-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","annieo212","Very light, but cute!","I was expecting it to be a little heavier than it was, but still was a nice lounging piece!","21-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","PhojoAmy","So Unique","So interesting and unique. Wore it to a few zoom meetings and for OOTD photos. I ordered a size down as FP stuff is either crazy fitted and slim or completely oversized. Could have worn a small but that would defeat the intended oversized fit. Sill experimenting with styling but will likely keep. Different than anything I own.","5-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","Carotay","Bought it!","LOVE LOVE LOVE.. Such a cute fit. It does run large but I like for my stuff to be slightly baggy. I bought this and can't wait to wear it again.","3-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","kangus","LOVE IT but it runs large!","This was my go-to Friday casual top - got compliments every time i wore it. Would recommend sizing down - I'm a medium in nearly everything but a small would've fit me better.","14-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","MaggieCaroline","Obsessed with this top!","I read the reviews before selecting my size. I love oversized tops, so I went with my typical size choice (M), and was very pleased! Super cute tucked into jeans or even over leggings. Love wearing it off the shoulder.","12-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","rachsham","Wrinkle Haters Beware","This top is SO CUTE. Definitely needed to wear a tank top under it as the neckline would shift around as I wore it, especially while wrangling a child. My only problem was that it wrinkled SO easily. Probably would have bought it otherwise! Styled it with some crop flare jeans and white converse and it looked cool yet effortless!","6-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","Readingirl","Arizona road trip chic","Got it for a road trip in the southwest, and it perfectly fit the occasion. I did have to use some double-sided tape to close the vneck a bit but that worked great. Would have worn more on weekends if it weren’t winter back home. Ultimately it felt too trendy to buy.","2-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beating-hearts-top?color=010","SKDink55","Fun top","I liked this top with a few caveats! The elastic on the wrists is pretty tight if you pull it up onto your forearms. It runs really big, so if you wear it with the tag at your neck, you will be showing your bra and on me, the front slit almost went all the way down to my belly button. But! You can wear it pulled back with the front collar closer to your neck and it's a billowy, off the shoulder type look.

Truthfully I never got to wear it because it's a bit too dressy to style it for the workplace, and although the long sleeves are sheer, they were too much for a night out in the summer. It's a flexible fit, though I'm usually between a S/M and I could've sized all the way down to the XS. I also feel as thought it needs to be styled the way it is on the model - it's a lot of dress without being broken up by a belt. Overall I'm bummed I never got to wear it! I'll probably rent again in the winter for the holidays.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I am short with a short torso and it was fine for me but I can see how if you are taller you might have it ride up a little. I loved how oversized this was. It IS sheer for a small line on each side.

But these fit like a (super comfortable) glove! The jean material is so soft and has some stretch to it. It's not as dark as in the photos, it was more of a true medium wash than a medium-dark wash.

They're an interesting rust color, very close to the picture, so they weren't the easiest to style, but their comfort more than made up for that. I was also a teensy bit short for them, but I'm 5'1. They were true to size, if you like your pants not too tight.","30-Nov-2019"

Unfortunately, I could barely get it buttoned up and worried the buttons would fly open if I tried to sit down in it. Definitely runs small- unless the sizing is in AU since it's an Australian brand? Either way, I recommend sizing up!","26-Nov-2019"

I'm rating these a 5: points for chic style, color, construction and comfort. However, these are a little on the large side of a 24 and there is a fair amount of stretch to the material. They are buttery soft but still feel sturdy.","The high rise made these fit loosely around the waist but otherwise flattering and a great length to wear with flats or heels. I wore them with a gold blouse and cream leather mules. Will wear them again with a leopard print sweater or a brown suede jacket. I love the way the color can read as a neutral.","25-Nov-2019"

I had a hard time finding the right place for them to sit on my hips that didn't create problems in the crotch.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/clean-front-anessa-jeans?color=028","peachyallie","Rather tight for a 30","It's a fine line between enough stretch that pants fit and so much stretch that they sink into every crease your body holds. I had a hard time finding the right place for them to sit on my hips that didn't create problems in the crotch. They are extremely comfortable, however, and the color is flattering, so I would recommend to other hourglass shapes that typically wear under a size 30.","8-Oct-2019"

I live in Georgia so I layered a tank top over it to feel like fall when its still 90 degrees in September. I can't wait to rock it with boots and a chunky sweater. The neckline is rather low, but looks great on a small bust, just not at work. I think it would be a tough style to wear with a large bust. You can see black undergarments thru it, but that is an easy fix as its not meant for any kind of bra. I will be purchasing this. I got two compliments in the first 20 minutes of wearing it. One from boyfriend who follows no trends and the other from a girl half my age with mad style. WIN!","24-Sep-2019"

I was never sure if I could rock the slip dress style but this was loose enough that I felt confident even on my softest days while also hitting in all the right spots so was super flattering. I wore it solo, with one of the vintage camo jackets I rented over it, with a white oversized tee knotted & a denim jacket & sneakers, and also with a black tee over knotted with black boots & rancher hat. It has so many looks in one dress. It also feels like you are wearing nothing at all & is super breezy so had been great for these super hot end of summer days. I am also a stylist & have worn it on shoot days & it is long enough & has enough move around room that I can bend over & squat down when I need to pin. Recommended for every body!","9-Sep-2019"

I am 5’10 and usually wear a 10/12. The length came right to my ankles which I liked. The second time I ordered them I opted for the 32 since the 31 was not in stock.. the 32 still fit but sat lower on my hip and were way more relaxed — I liked this look also. I would say go true to size if you want them to be more fitted like the model or size up for a more relaxed fit.. either way these are super cute with heeled booties and a fitted body suit.","4-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flavie-trouser-jeans?color=092","rileyand","Great fit, a little odd length","I really loved the fit of these jeans. I wear a lot of cropped wide-leg jeans and I've never had a pair make my waist and lower stomach look so good. Normally jeans like this bunch up near the front pockets on me, but these laid completely flat. The denim is sooo soft and extremely comfortable - I could literally sleep in these jeans. Only knocking off one star because they are an odd length. They look like they should be ankle length, but on me they were just shy of a full-length pant. I still made it work by wearing chunkier shoes, but when I tried on my slimmer shoes the length didn't do me any favors. That being said, if you're taller or don't mind a longer crop, they are fine. Once I got used to it, these became a staple! Will definitely re-order again.","24-Oct-2019"

I wore them with a leopard belt as a jumpsuit and also with a striped shirt as overalls. I liked them more with a shirt under them as the neckline kind of sags forward (maybe this wouldn't happen with a larger bust) and they look a little more like overalls. The thick material also gives more of an impression of an overall than a jumpsuit.

I’m a true apple shape with thicker waist larger breasts and skinny legs and bottom. This flatters me well. Loose in the right spots but shows off my neck line and hugs my butt. It’s also super hip.

I had read the review and sized down, thought the medium was still a little big. I wish it would have fit tighter vs. fitting like a shift dress and being more off the body. The neckline is pretty deep, and challenging to wear a bra. The square is cut low, and shows parts of your bra. It also really gapes at the bust. Great wash, and style though.","14-Oct-2019"

I ended up using double-sided tape to have it look as if it was buttoned all the way to the collar. The belt was a little long, so I also used double-sided tape to help it stay close to the dress vs. hanging down. It is a little on the shorter side, so I did feel the need to wear shorted underneath. I'm very happy with this piece though - super fun and perfect for hot day!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I am thick in the butt and thighs, and these were entirely too tight in that area. That said, they are very cute and sturdy and I think I would have worn them frequently if they had fit me. They are traditional style instead of the skimpier, strappier cuts of some modern overalls. I was a 90s grunge grrl in college so I was looking forward to reliving my youth in these - but I would have to get my 90’s body back to wear these in the M.","5-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/parvati-velvet-lace-top?color=011","SofiaM","Pretty, good quality","This is such a cute, feminine top. The fabric was a lot softer than I had expected, which was really nice, and it fit very well. The sleeves are a little ruched, and could make your upper arms look like they are poofing out a little (it does with me, but it's still so cute, so I don't mind). The best part about it is that it's not see-through at all, and you can't see the bra straps as long as you're wearing a nude-colored one. I've worn this out to dinner and to work, so it's very multifunctional depending on what you style it with.","30-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kroes-skirt?color=027","joelledweisser","I don't get it","The color and material are great but I do not recommend this skirt. The fit is bizarre. I sized down based on other reviews but the waist was still too big, and very oddly designed. I could not figure out a way to make it look cute, there is so much material at the waist, maybe a smaller size would fix that but I'm not sure.","17-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/kroes-skirt?color=027","natty","I thought it was way awkward, but everyone else loved it!","Like previous reviews, the waist felt super frumpy and awkward. I have a really long torso and flat tummy, but the waist (though it felt true to size—I ordered a MP) would slowly slip down and leave a wonky looking bulge. This bulge was accentuated by the odd little tassel hanging down in front—that served no functional purpose and only drew further attention to the awkwardness of the waist bulge situation. Maybe, MAAAAAAAYBE, sizing down would have helped, but again, the size felt right. (With that silky, slippery fabric, what the skirt really needs is a drawstring to hold it in place!) Here’s how I made it “work...ish”: I decided to tie the little tassel thing into a loose bow, and I wore the skirt backwards! This helped immensely. I wore it high on my waist with a black, flowy, silk button down, tucked in all the way, with black clogs. The petit length was perfect for my long torso and short legs. And surprisingly, even though I thought the whole get up was pretty “meh,” I received so.many.freaking.compliments. One gorgeous young thing (I’m 38, she was probably 22 or 23)—who clearly has an eye for fashion—literally chased me down the street to catch up with me and tell me how “totally obsessed” she was with my outfit and specifically the skirt. “Like, where did you get that?! I have to have it!” So maybe it feels weirder than it actually looks? Though, I will say, if you’ve got a short torso, I just cannot imagine you being able to make this work well for you. Hope this weird review is at least somewhat helpful. Ha! It’s a tough piece to explain/review!","25-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/boswell-textured-wrap-tunic?color=069","floralfan","Big fan!","In my opinion, this ran TTS. While wrap-styles can be unpredictable, they also can be very flattering. I found this dress to work great for my frame (see details above). The floral is perfect for summer or early fall. The style is great for a backyard event, wedding/event, or casual with a moto jacket into fall. I’m a big fan and will be purchasing!","5-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/boswell-textured-wrap-tunic?color=069","Glittergirl","Great dress, awesome color, size up.","I love this dress. Perfectly my type of everyday dress. I’m a solid 14 and this dress definitely ran snug in bust and sleeves. It also pulled a little bit at the pockets… So the hips were also a little bit small. I’m disappointed as I was hoping to purchase this from my nuuly box. But I will have to wait and purchase it at Anthropologie in the larger size. The color is sensational.","15-Aug-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fleetwood-tunic-dress?color=041","hiandhello","Great in concept, but not that flattering","I loved this dress in theory, but it was definitely large and the length came to my knees which just made it look kind of dowdy.

Nothing against the garment though-this was totally my bad (I was too excited when I got my Nuuly invite!). I tried this on anyways and the fit was perfect. I was a tiny bit afraid this would look like a mumu on me but somehow the ruffles and lace help distract from the shapelessness. I will definitely add this to a future box when Fall arrives!","16-Aug-2019"

The sleeves are ballooned and the smocking ensures a good fit over the shoulders. The buttons are silver snaps which means more boob security. The belt is kind of take it or leave it. I’ve worn it with and without. Versatile piece for transitioning into spring and summer. My husband said “you should keep that one”. :) Can’t argue with that!","26-Mar-2020"
