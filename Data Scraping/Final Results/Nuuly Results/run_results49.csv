"https://www.nuuly.com/products/salt-spray-jacket?color=010","creativejordan","Cute, but rides up","This was cute. The lacey pattern is subtle because it is underneath the outermost layer of the jacket. It didn't rain when I wore it so I can't speak to how waterproof it is, but it was nice for nights when it got chillier on vacation (60 degrees). The waistline rode up and that was kind of annoying. I always wore it with jumpsuits or dresses, but I can imagine it would keep bringing your shirt along with it when it rides up.","15-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/salt-spray-jacket?color=010","McKenzieJ","Cute jacket but waistband isn't great","This jacket is adorable, light, airy, and great for the gym. The only downfall is the waistband rides up with the jacket is zipped. I have a short torso and when the waistband would bunch up, the jacket would billow.","9-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/salt-spray-jacket?color=010","Gigibyte","Unique, light sport jacket","I've been looking for a white jacket to wear to the gym (or put on right after a workout) and this one ticks all the boxes! It's soft, fits true to size, and the lining is a knit pattern that shows through the sheer outer giving it a unique look. I like the long cuffs and waistband too. I might love it too much to return it!","3-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/salt-spray-jacket?color=010","amyelizabeth","My new favorite sweatshirt","This sweatshirt is so comfy! It definitely fits large, so no need to size up if you want an oversized look. Great for heading to yoga or just walking around on a chilly day.","30-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/zoya-one-shoulder-dress?color=001","witheredandboney","Perfect LBD!","I loved this dress - it’s so comfortable, simple and flattering. I was worried that it would hang off of me, but it hugged my curves and showed off my booty. I was hoping to wear this to brunch or on a date, but it didn’t pan out. Will definitely rent again!","20-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/zoya-one-shoulder-dress?color=001","Logan","Way too big, not styleable","While I really wanted to love this as a casual day look, it was huge and By huge I mean I am a very average sized girl with a larger chest and ordered an XS and it still didn’t fit. The photo is deceiving.","4-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/zoya-one-shoulder-dress?color=001","Hanz","A great dress!","I wore this dress to a casual party and it worked perfectly. I paired it with low black boots. If you wore heels or a fancier shoe you could 100% dress it up for any occasion. It was perfectly roomy in the body for me which I loved because it was comfy and worked to be casual. Sleeve length was perfect. The side which doesn’t have a sleeve was a little loose. If my bust was any smaller it would probably slip a little. I ended up buying it because I can imagine a lot of places and occasions where I could wear it!","4-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/zoya-one-shoulder-dress?color=001","ErinAG","large and heavy","I ordered a medium but it was very large, additionally, it was like sweatshirt material and didn't look very nice... or like something I'd want to wear to dinner in a warm place.","21-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/zoya-one-shoulder-dress?color=001","Heatherx21","Elegant and comfortable","I wore this dress to a holiday party and received so many compliments.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/zoya-one-shoulder-dress?color=001","LoverofColors20","Casual yet sexy","I enjoyed wearing this. Though it did expose the chest a bit more than I’d like because the sleeveless part hung a little low for me but I still loved this dress","6-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/zoya-one-shoulder-dress?color=001","haleliz","Adorable but didn't fit","Okay in full disclosure I do have a pretty string-bean like body, but I could not get this dress to stay up. Specifically the side that does not have a sleeve- it gapped near my armpit and made me nervous it would slide down. I think it would be beautiful on someone who maybe filled it out more.","25-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/zoya-one-shoulder-dress?color=001","Musicfan3121","Fun going out piece","I got this to wear ""out"", and it was a great piece for that. I personally wore it with my vegan leather leggings, but it wasn't too short to wear on it's own either.","25-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/zoya-one-shoulder-dress?color=001","Madison13","Too big & boxy","I loved the idea of this dress, but the fit was weird and the pockets made it very boxy on the bottom of the dress.","25-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mindy-rigid-flare-jeans?color=047","KelleyP","Definitely high waisted","The denim of these pants is soft and comfortable. They fit for the most part but were a little more snug in the hips and thighs than I would've liked. They loosened up a little after the first couple times I wore them. Next time I'll just order a size up. These are srsly high waisted! If you are on the fence about whether you like that style or not, try a more subtle high waist first. Also probably not a great pick for women who are petite. I'm 5'8"" and still needed to wear them with a bit of a heel.","19-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mindy-rigid-flare-jeans?color=047","HappyinFL","Way too high waisted","The waist was way too high. It almost reached my bra! I also didn’t like that the jeans did not have front pockets. I wore the jeans with a sweater that covered up the high waist. The wide legs were fine & didn’t drag when the waist & crouch of the jeans were in the proper position. Glad I tried a couple of pairs of high waisted jeans. Did not like.","12-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mindy-rigid-flare-jeans?color=047","LauraLately","The Worst!","Unless you’re built like a supermodel or a giraffe these pants will not fit. The leg length and the “high waist” are ridiculously high and long. For the average size gal, these pants are way too long and the high waist is up to the ribs and literally under the breasts. I couldn’t help but laugh when I attempted to put these on. Honestly, Nuuly should take these pants out of rotation. The cut and size are the worst and are strictly for someone who happens to be 6 feet tall and has the longest torso ever. I feel like I wasted a rental period with these pants.","22-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mindy-rigid-flare-jeans?color=047","dayzed","A VERY high waist","These jeans were super cute, but as a gal with a short torso they were cutting into my ribs.

If I owned them I would have to hem them though, they’re about a 32” length which I didn’t realize when I ordered them. Unfortunately I only have one pair of shoes tall enough to wear them with so they don’t drag and they’re not work or walking-in-new orleans friendly. Very soft denim, very comfortable waist (hit at the bottom of my ribcage), and VERY flattering. Short girls be aware of the length though!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/water-lily-wide-leg-pants?color=014","tapala","Effortlessly chic with legs for days","I'm obsessed with these pants! I wore them at my waist with a bodysuit and heels, as they were super long. I expected them to be long bc of my height, but couldn't wear anything less than a 4-inch heel, which was fine by me because it made my legs look long. Due to the length and flowy-ness I had to be a bit careful not to step on the bottom as I almost tripped at one point while hurrying to catch a train (the pants were maybe a centimeter or two from the ground so not dragging). I wasn't overly cognizant of this while out at dinner and a low-key bar but I definitely wouldn't wear to a super crowded place because people would step on it. The waist fit well - I probably could've sized down and dealt with some waist snugness to lessen the length because they are so flowy all over. For reference my waist is 25-26 inches and hips are 34 inches.","13-Aug-2019"

I wore it to work with a cute turtleneck and tights under it and I also wore it out at night with a leather jacket. The material was super soft and I loved that I was able to wear it without a bra!! My only small complaints would be that because the material was so soft it did look a bit worn in. The straps were also a bit stretchy so even though I wore it without a bra, I felt like I needed to pull it up sometimes. Overall, this dress is supppperr cute and I think if I were to rent again I would probably buy it. Def would recommend.","26-Nov-2019"

The straps have a stretch to them and don’t rub or sit tight on your shoulders which is awesome! I wonder if I could have sized up to a medium. Mostly because of my bust (32D).

Very easily dressed down or up. As other reviewers note, though, this is really only for us small-tiddied women. I'm like, an A cup and I still cut it close.

When I first wore the dress, I didn't realize that the straps tied at the shoulder (lol) -- so I tucked the back straps in and wore it as a halter dress. I finally figured it out and wore as intended in the photo; however, both ways worked and looked cute! The front bottons slightly pulled due to my bust being too wide. I think the size M would fit perfectly on someone who wore a 34; however, even with a 36B it worked well.","19-Aug-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sugar-pie-sweater?color=065","Bee","Cropped and fitted","I wish I hadn't sized down based on other reviews. Usually a S but went with the XS suggestion. It was a little too flattering, if you know what i mean. The cut emphasizes the waist AND the chest, which means if you wear it with skinny jeans you're too boom-boom-boom for work. But since it's cropped I couldn't wear it with my regular-rise pants or jeans without having an awkward waist gap. Since it was too much for work, I tried to wear it to the movies on the weekend --- then the turtleneck felt too stuffy and the puffed sleeves seemed too formal for daytime. Maybe it's just my body type, or maybe a size up (to my normal size) would have fixed all of this. I really wanted to love the sweater...

Also the poufs on the shoulders are more pronounced in person, which made it more of a statement piece than I was expecting. I still wore it a couple times, and it is very warm- I was even too hot trying to wear it in the office for a whole day. It was slightly scratchy to me.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sugar-pie-sweater?color=020","Bee","Cropped and fitted","I wish I hadn't sized down based on other reviews. Usually a S but went with the XS suggestion. It was a little too flattering, if you know what i mean. The cut emphasizes the waist AND the chest, which means if you wear it with skinny jeans you're too boom-boom-boom for work. But since it's cropped I couldn't wear it with my regular-rise pants or jeans without having an awkward waist gap. Since it was too much for work, I tried to wear it to the movies on the weekend --- then the turtleneck felt too stuffy and the puffed sleeves seemed too formal for daytime. Maybe it's just my body type, or maybe a size up (to my normal size) would have fixed all of this. I really wanted to love the sweater... I just couldn't really find the right bottoms to go with it.","20-Dec-2019"

I belted it at the waist to give myself a shape but if you are thin and straight shaped I think you would do just fine.","12-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/farrah-jeans?color=091","Katy","So cool but VERY long","Granted I am short but even with 6"" platforms these were touching the ground. Otherwise though, so cool.

I loved these jeans but they were extremely long to the point where they were basically impossible to wear. I'm 5'5 and it's rare that a pair of pants is noticeably long on me but I paired these with my highest heels & I was still stepping on the ends. They need to be hemmed or the average person could never wear them! Super disappointing.","3-Nov-2019"

I wore them for Halloween and for a college football game and loved the style. I am 5'9 and had to wear pretty tall wedges with them so the jeans didn't hit the floor. worked really well for me, but keep this in mind if you have short legs.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flowers-in-december-blouse?color=060","Lesliederwin","Beautiful color, but weird fit","The color of this top is amazing. But it is very sheer so you have to wear a tank top under it. For me, that is really uncomfortable! Way too much fabric. It just hung awkwardly on me, I am not sure if it is because I needed a petite, or what it was, but it just didn’t quite fit right.","14-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flowers-in-december-blouse?color=060","skreks","Great color! Although see-through.","First off, the color on this top is amazing. So bright and really fun. The material feels high quality and the neckline and buttons are wonderful details. My biggest issue with it is that it's very see through throughout the entire top which is not entirely clear in the product imagery. You will need to wear a camisole or something underneath. Second, I tried tucking this in and decided it looks better out. There is a lot of fabric, and it would bunch up strange and the sides would become untucked since they were shorter. You could probably get away with it with really high-waisted jeans.","15-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flowers-in-december-blouse?color=060","honestvibes","HUGE and see through","I know Free People tends to run large, but this is on a whole new level.

It's also transparent, which again, I'm fine with and have lots of tops that require a cami. But for it to be red and still feel transparent is odd. The fit is what really killed it though, just terrible porportions- sleeve to torso ratio-wise. I did wear it a lot of family functions during the holidays because, well, red.","28-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flowers-in-december-blouse?color=060","Bee","Sweet","This worked well for me, for work. I wore tucked into dark skinny jeans and also with navy dress pants, both times with a cream cardi over it. The print was really sweet, paired with the delicate pintucks and sheer material. On the weekend I wore it untucked with wide-leg chambray jeans and felt more of a boho vibe. Here's the downside - it's all about the tuck and poof situation: I had to always layer over this top because I struggled with the short length. When untucked it looked a bit sloppy. When tucked, it didn't stay tucked right so I constantly had to re-tuck. Kind of made me ready to take it off after work. Even when it was fully tucked, the extra buttons on the side-seam tag increased the poof factor so I had to just cover all of that with the cardi. It might work better for straighter body types. Higher-waisted jeans looked really strange because there was so much poof at the top -- just really was not flattering for my body type.","10-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flowers-in-december-blouse?color=011","skreks","Great color! Although see-through.","First off, the color on this top is amazing. So bright and really fun. The material feels high quality and the neckline and buttons are wonderful details. My biggest issue with it is that it's very see through throughout the entire top which is not entirely clear in the product imagery. You will need to wear a camisole or something underneath. Second, I tried tucking this in and decided it looks better out. There is a lot of fabric, and it would bunch up strange and the sides would become untucked since they were shorter. You could probably get away with it with really high-waisted jeans.","15-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flowers-in-december-blouse?color=011","honestvibes","HUGE and see through","I know Free People tends to run large, but this is on a whole new level. It is HUGE and I can style flowy tops no problem, usually. In fact, I usually get a small and could stand to wear an XS but I like a bit of comfortable roominess. It's also transparent, which again, I'm fine with and have lots of tops that require a cami. But for it to be red and still feel transparent is odd. The fit is what really killed it though, just terrible porportions- sleeve to torso ratio-wise. I did wear it a lot of family functions during the holidays because, well, red.","28-Jan-2020"

The very airy fit (others described it as boxy but it’s not that bad) and material works best when tucked into pants, with the elasticized arms (at the wrists) offering a little more tailoring to the overall look. The color is incredible, though slightly sheer. I wore this 4 or 5 times and received multiple compliments wherever I went. Seriously stunning top.","28-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/flowers-in-december-blouse?color=011","Bee","Sweet","This worked well for me, for work. I wore tucked into dark skinny jeans and also with navy dress pants, both times with a cream cardi over it. The print was really sweet, paired with the delicate pintucks and sheer material. On the weekend I wore it untucked with wide-leg chambray jeans and felt more of a boho vibe. Here's the downside - it's all about the tuck and poof situation: I had to always layer over this top because I struggled with the short length. When untucked it looked a bit sloppy. When tucked, it didn't stay tucked right so I constantly had to re-tuck. Kind of made me ready to take it off after work. Even when it was fully tucked, the extra buttons on the side-seam tag increased the poof factor so I had to just cover all of that with the cardi. It might work better for straighter body types. Higher-waisted jeans looked really strange because there was so much poof at the top -- just really was not flattering for my body type.","10-Nov-2019"

It was sheer but not too sheer, it doesn’t fit skin tight and the neck is not a tight turtle neck. It is a bit more peachy than in the photos but I loved it nonetheless!

They have a good amount of stretch and slim fit from the knee up. The pockets sit lower, and make the booty look great.

I do have thic(cccer) legs than the model, but it was really loose around the waist, but tighter at the thighs & hips area. the pants end up falling a bit, so I had to pull them up a couple times, but I think my body type just doesn't fit the jeans well. I was hoping that the rips would still be left attached, but they were already ripped through by the time I received them. I have other pairs of jeans similar to these, but just wanted to try the brand out. probably wouldn't purchase from the brand again, but I appreciate the opportunity to try the fit out. Usually paired with mules, loafers, & even combat boots when I rolled the pants up. simple t-shirts on top so as not to take away from the jeans.","6-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/parker-jeans?color=001","funkybanana","Best jeans of all time!!","Loved this so much. Fit loose, so they were so comfy and nice to wear. The cuts made them more stylish and fun. The waist was slightly loose but that was the trade-off for how comfy they were. The BEST. Still debating buying them - fav jeans!","29-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/parker-jeans?color=001","nolagal","Great, but check on the fit!","Great jeans and so versatile! I own some other AGOLDE jeans and know that the fit depends on the fabric. In their stretchy skinny jeans I am a 25, like in other brands like Madewell/ J Brand. But for these I was happy that I sized up to a 27. The 27 was a little loose in the waist, but it meant that the jeans were loose the entire length of my legs which is the look I was hoping for. I have pretty muscular legs though, so if I was a little tinier I might have only sized up one. I wore these with both crop tops and t-shirts and loved them both! Trying to decide if I want to keep it :)","14-Oct-2019"

But nevertheless I got 5 compliments the day I wore it so 🤷🏼‍♀️","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It is actually a really thick, gauze-like material, and it has a sort of pirate look to it. That being said, I liked it enough to wear it once, and I did receive a compliment on it. But I don't see revisiting this piece in my wardrobe. The material feels like high quality, and there's some cute metal details on the sleeves. But it's really easy to miss all that detail because this top is SO oversized. I'm a girl who likes comfy and oversized, but this was overdoing it, even for me. The material is so thick that I don't see the top tucking in very well either.","24-Dec-2019"

The material is heavier And the shirt has much more fabric than appears in the photo. I am pregnant so didn’t try to tuck it in, but I think it would be difficult to tuck. The shirt actually snaps to a faux wrap at the bottom which is not seen in the photo. It was still very cute and fit well with my baby bump at 22-26 weeks pregnant. I added the plaid one to my next nuuly box so I can try this style again as it cools down. This is definitely looser fitting than on the model. I ordered an XS which is my pre pregnancy size, and still had room to grow. I’m 5’4 and currently about 130lbs. Pre-pregnancy (108 lbs) the XS would likely be too big for me.","17-Oct-2019"

It is actually a really thick, gauze-like material, and it has a sort of pirate look to it. That being said, I liked it enough to wear it once, and I did receive a compliment on it. But I don't see revisiting this piece in my wardrobe. The material feels like high quality, and there's some cute metal details on the sleeves. But it's really easy to miss all that detail because this top is SO oversized. I'm a girl who likes comfy and oversized, but this was overdoing it, even for me. The material is so thick that I don't see the top tucking in very well either.","24-Dec-2019"

The material is heavier And the shirt has much more fabric than appears in the photo. I am pregnant so didn’t try to tuck it in, but I think it would be difficult to tuck. The shirt actually snaps to a faux wrap at the bottom which is not seen in the photo. It was still very cute and fit well with my baby bump at 22-26 weeks pregnant. I added the plaid one to my next nuuly box so I can try this style again as it cools down. This is definitely looser fitting than on the model. I ordered an XS which is my pre pregnancy size, and still had room to grow. I’m 5’4 and currently about 130lbs. Pre-pregnancy (108 lbs) the XS would likely be too big for me.","17-Oct-2019"

I believe I ordered the correct size, but it was very short in the torso, and the tie (which is fixed in the back so you can't adjust) was in a weird place on me. Also, because of the fit, with just those buttons in front, it was very difficult to get in an out of. I'm 5'9"" but I've got a pretty short torso compared to my long legs. The legs were long enough, the torso definitely too short.","28-Oct-2019"

I like the ruffle at the wrist and the small puff on the shoulders. I usually fit in a size small but got this in a medium because I was afraid a small might be too tight or short. I think I could have gotten away with either size. What I don't love about this item is how loose it is around my waist and therefore hides it giving me a boxier look. I also that's just the cut though and wouldn't be fixed if I got the size small. Also not crazy about the pattern in person. It reminds me of grandma's curtains.

I think I could have gotten away with either size. What I don't love about this item is how loose it is around my waist and therefore hides it giving me a boxier look. I also that's just the cut though and wouldn't be fixed if I got the size small. Also not crazy about the pattern in person. It reminds me of grandma's curtains.

Super comfy soft stretch fabric, with a fitted bodice, ruffled cuffs and skirt that is not too short. Definitely work appropriate for us petite ladies.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","sriog","a little large, a little worn","i like the style of this jumpsuit, i though maybe i could tighten it up given the straps in the back but its barely adjustable, so it was a little baggy on me. it must be a popular item bc the one i received seems to be quite worn / washed many times perhaps?","9-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","trangxnguyen11","LOVED these coveralls!","I wore this on vacation to Portugal (and even while hiking!) and it was comfortable, warm (but not stuffy), and was bright and stand out in pictures! I was worried I'd drown it in, since I'm pretty petite, but it fit perfectly - even length wise. Definitely more of full length pants then the ankle fit that the model has, but it worked well with any shoes I paired with it.","9-Dec-2019"

I didn't expect the fabric to be so thick, like flannel, and though it made it look kind of bulky on me, it made it feel all the more creamy and comfortable. The only thing I didn't love was the buttons. I wish it had been a zipper or had included as sash - just something to make it slightly sleeker. All in all, recommend this piece!","9-Dec-2019"

There's a little stretch to the material so it's very comfortable and not too rigid. The fit was great, it was just baggy enough but not like I was swimming in it. And the fabric is thick enough to keep you warm on a chilly night. A total winner!","6-Dec-2019"

Generally, I have a hard time with them because I have wide hips/ long torso just all around odd for a one piece hahaha - I liked the fact that I could sinch it in with the buttons on the back but the legs were really wide on me and I cuffed them which looked not great in my opinion.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","coldslaw99","Didn't fit me well","I wore this around the house but the fit was too awkward to wear out.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","styleschwartz","LOVE this jumpsuit","This jumpsuit was awesome. I wore it a few times when the weather was on the warmer side, since it's hard to wear a jacket over it. I live in Dallas so we still get warmer weather this time of year.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","lilpow","Super cute but baggy jumpsuit","I absolutely loved this jumpsuit - I wore it at least 3 times. It definitely does run on the baggier side but I think that's the look of it. I wore this to work, out during the day on the weekends and it was super comfortable and also warm. I wore it with just a black turtleneck out during the day and was perfectly warm.","26-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","EB","Favorite Jumpsuit EVER","This jumpsuit has become a new staple in my office - multiple people now own it after renting. It's amazing! So flattering and just the right amount of room where you want it. I am normally a medium across the board, and rented a M originally - it fit, but was a little bit baggy for my taste. Ordered the small in both colors that I now own! Wish I could wear them every day.","26-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","lavitacarlita","Good, basic jumpsuit -- but not perfect","this is totally decent jumpsuit, enough that I wore it twice this month, but it's definitely not perfect due to fit and fabric. a lot of others have noted that the sizing is generous on this, so I'd fully agree with the advice to size down. and yes, there are some little button-closure tabs at the back/sides that allow you to cinch it in a little bit for waist definition, but on my body cinching like that just resulted in a big airy bulge of loose fabric in the upper back that didn't look great (I threw a jacket on top to hide that both times I wore this). my bigger issue with this jumpsuit, sizing aside, is that the fabric doesn't feel very sturdy or flattering. though the garment fit me fine it was prone to some odd and uneven pulling at some of the middle buttons when I moved around, the buttons themselves were really hard to fit into the holes, and the fabric felt stretched out, wrinkly, and worn as the day so I was feeling pretty disheveled in it by 5pm. I'm obsessed with jumpsuits & the REALLY amazing ones I own are made of fabric that sits more smoothly on the body so as not to have this issue even after a full day of wear.","25-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","NvrNuude","Weekend Workhorse","Got tons of wear out of this jumpsuit. I mostly wore it alone, but one cool night I put a turtleneck under it. On someone of my height, it won't come close to covering the ankles, but that wasn't a problem for me. One of my favorite pieces this month.","25-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","Simonewhatever","Cute idea, poorly made","I liked the idea of this a lot. The fit was fine on me but a little short since I am tall. But the material was lacking. You could tell it’s been used a lot with the wear and the color. Don’t regret it but not perfect.","24-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","MaryMargaret","Love","Love this jumpsuit. The fit was good, and I liked that it wasn’t tight at the waist, but you could belt it if you were going for that look.","24-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","geckogirl","Very cute- but a little loose","I loved this and could style it so many ways. Medium was a bit loose, but you can bring in the waste with the buttons in the back and that made it a bit more fitted. But beware, one of the buttons fell off quickly and I had to sew it back on. I'm looking forward to renting the other color of this too. Really well-made besides the button issue.","20-Nov-2019"

I'm 5'5"" and these were a little longer than ideal - kind of a strange not short but not full length - but that didn't keep me from wearing them. If you're choosing between two sizes, size down.","18-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","Bawana","Cool and flattering.","So I rented this for a Halloween costume in a size larger than I would normally rent because I wanted to make sure it was long enough in the torso (5’11) but I think a medium would have been just fine too. I might rent again in my actual size (medium). It has button options to cinch in the waist so that’s nice. I felt like a cool girl in it. Would recommend!","9-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=011","Mschief","i was sort of surprised at how many compliments i got on them every time i wore them","the fabric is pretty thick. when i first put it on, i thought that it was sort of unflattering, like it looked a little boxy and maybe too workman-y. like i was coming over to paint someone's house. but, if you style it accordingly, it looks very stylish to a certain group of people. i wore it once like the model with a blue scarf and grey suede boots (it's a weird length that makes it impossible to stay tucked in). i also wore it with a black turtleneck underneath and black lace-ups. i wore it to two different parties, and received so many compliments from multiple people at both.","1-Nov-2019"

Wore it with and without a wide belt, bandana around the neck like in the photos, and a turtleneck underneath, with chunky sneakers, and high ankle heeled boots.

It was a little long in the torso area and a little tighter than I would usually want in the butt and front areas. Most jumpsuits tend to be like this on me, so I'm not surprised. Regardless, I had so much fun styling. I wore with doc marten chelsea boots and rolled up the legs, once with booties, and it would also be super cute with sneakers. Definitely high quality.","12-Oct-2019"

What I loved about this design is that it can be tightened at the waist and actually gave me some definition instead of it being super baggy! I was really unsure of this but I paired it with some more feminine accessories to make it more my style and it was super comfortable. I wish I could have worn it more but it was unfortunately too hot where I live to be able to wear it again in the same month!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I’m a sucker for oversized coveralls/boilersuits/overalls/whatever. These were perfectly oversized, but the draping had it lay in such a way where you it still looked like I had a waist. The fabric is thick but soft. It’s not see-through, which was a concern of mine when picking it!! I wore this several times with black tights and a black long sleeve, but you’d never know. Most importantly, I got endless compliments wearing it. Just get it! You’re gonna love it!!","10-Mar-2020"

The large size fits more like a 8-10 dress size. As a woman who wears a size 32 jeans and a size 12-14 dress, this was comically small and didn’t go past my hips. So disappointing.","25-Feb-2020"

All the reviews were glowing, there were plenty of pics of women with different body types, I genuinely thought these could be a home run. Wrong. I’m 5’2 and short in every sense of the word. These were extremely unflattering. Odd length in the legs and the sleeves, and the torso was all wrong. To be fair, I’m typically a petite when I go for a romper style, so I’m not surprised they didn’t fit. Great fabric, great color. And to everyone who wore these and they looked great... kudos!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=236","lavitacarlita","Good, basic jumpsuit -- but not perfect","this is totally decent jumpsuit, enough that I wore it twice this month, but it's definitely not perfect due to fit and fabric. a lot of others have noted that the sizing is generous on this, so I'd fully agree with the advice to size down. and yes, there are some little button-closure tabs at the back/sides that allow you to cinch it in a little bit for waist definition, but on my body cinching like that just resulted in a big airy bulge of loose fabric in the upper back that didn't look great (I threw a jacket on top to hide that both times I wore this). my bigger issue with this jumpsuit, sizing aside, is that the fabric doesn't feel very sturdy or flattering. though the garment fit me fine it was prone to some odd and uneven pulling at some of the middle buttons when I moved around, the buttons themselves were really hard to fit into the holes, and the fabric felt stretched out, wrinkly, and worn as the day so I was feeling pretty disheveled in it by 5pm. I'm obsessed with jumpsuits & the REALLY amazing ones I own are made of fabric that sits more smoothly on the body so as not to have this issue even after a full day of wear.","25-Nov-2019"

On someone of my height, it won't come close to covering the ankles, but that wasn't a problem for me. One of my favorite pieces this month.","25-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=236","Simonewhatever","Cute idea, poorly made","I liked the idea of this a lot. The fit was fine on me but a little short since I am tall. But the material was lacking. You could tell it’s been used a lot with the wear and the color. Don’t regret it but not perfect.","24-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=236","geckogirl","Very cute- but a little loose","I loved this and could style it so many ways. Medium was a bit loose, but you can bring in the waste with the buttons in the back and that made it a bit more fitted. But beware, one of the buttons fell off quickly and I had to sew it back on. I'm looking forward to renting the other color of this too. Really well-made besides the button issue.","20-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gia-coverall?color=236","Bawana","Cool and flattering.","So I rented this for a Halloween costume in a size larger than I would normally rent because I wanted to make sure it was long enough in the torso (5’11) but I think a medium would have been just fine too. I might rent again in my actual size (medium). It has button options to cinch in the waist so that’s nice. I felt like a cool girl in it. Would recommend!","9-Nov-2019"

What I loved about this design is that it can be tightened at the waist and actually gave me some definition instead of it being super baggy! I was really unsure of this but I paired it with some more feminine accessories to make it more my style and it was super comfortable. I wish I could have worn it more but it was unfortunately too hot where I live to be able to wear it again in the same month!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","mads4","Great party dress!","This dress was very cute and great to dress up or down. I'm glad I sized up because it was very short, I'm not even that tall and I felt the large was very skimpy on the bottom. The material is also very thin, I was expecting it to be more structured so it is pretty unforgiving. Overall I really liked this dress!","30-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","wildcat","Adorable dress!","This is a great dress. Fits really well with a little stretch so you can move. It's VERY short though - even on me and I'm 5'4"".","12-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","HaylinaMc","Too short, runs extra small","It's too bad the sizing is so off for this cute dress. It runs extremely small, and is very short. If you have a butt, it might not cover it. I am of average height and it felt very short. It hugs very tight around the midsection. Not flattering.","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","julezs","Good Summer Dress","Cute summer dress. Definitely on the shorter side and the material was a lot thinner than I expected. I liked the sleeve detail and the color of the dress though.","11-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","beancall","Awkward","This dress was awkward on me as a short, curvy person. The top was too baggy and the bottom fit, if a little tight. Perhaps this would work best for a tall, slender person.","6-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","cdillydally","Too short for a tall girl","I'm tall (5'11"") so mini dresses are always a risk for me but this one didn't look too short on the model so I thought I'd give it a shot! Unfortunately it was WAY too short on me and was totally unwearable. I ended up lending it to a friend while I had it for the month and she loved it! She's about 5'1"" and it was perfect for her.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","elle214","Pretty, but tight","It was pretty tight and not a lot of give. I would order again, but it a small.","11-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","Chargirl","Cute but dressier","I did not end up wearing it. I planned to wear sneakers with it but I felt the material made it too dressy for casual wear.","11-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","KirstieG","Glad I ordered a size up!","I was pleasantly surprised by this dress. Very good quality and adorable details like the puff sleeves and ruffle hem. The fabric has a slight sheen which makes it a bit fancier. It does show everything so if you carry any weight in your mid section (like me!) you’ll need shape wear. I wore the dress for some family pictures and I’m happy with how they turned out.","9-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","brttny","Body flattering despite thin fabric","The fabric on this is surprisingly thin and feels kind of cheap BUT the dress is a body flattering cut and it’s pretty cute / a nice color.","5-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","Abrowne2983","LOVED this dress!","Great dress if you’re looking to highlight your legs. Wore this for an anniversary dinner with my husband- he was a huge fan. Lol. Dress does run a little small and is short, but the high neckline and sleeves makes sure you’re not showing too much skin. I wore boy shorts underneath to avoid any wardrobe malfunctions.","27-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","LoveJoyPHL","Cute but too short","This dress is super cute but it’s too short to wear most places. I wore it to a concert with shorts underneath. It’s a thinner material than it appears so not good for cold weather. I’m normally an xs or s and went with a s.","25-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","leajay","Almost perfect","I wore this to a wedding welcome dinner and got so many compliments! It was so cute and almost perfect! my only call out is that it was a little loose/big in the waist.","23-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","beccsp","Beautiful pattern, flattering fit","This dress was a perfect length on my 5’4 figure. I think I could have sized down, but it still fit well and I loved the color and patten.","17-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","CR","Cute but short","Great fabric and color! I wanted wear this dress with tights and boots for a fall piece, but it was just a bit too short. I’m 5’5” and curvier on the bottom, it felt well up top but the bottom was too short to pull off.","14-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","rawrracquel","New Favorite!","In love with this dress. It fits true to size (though it does run short), and is a stunner! Received so many compliments each time I wore it, and ultimately decided to keep it.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","styleschwartz","Great for parties or get togethers","This dress is SO cute, and fit my arms, which I always worry about w/ non-stretch fabric since they're very muscular. I am glad I read the reviews and ordered a size medium, because it fit perfectly. I ended up wearing this for Rosh Hashanah with Chanel flats and thought it looked super cute! Would totally rent again.","1-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","tana_lindsay","Favorite Floral Dress","This dress was more than perfect. From the sleeves to the material and print of the dress, it has honestly been my favorite so far <3 It was slightly short for me, but if I went any bigger it wouldn't have fit the same.","25-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","brittanyafielding","CUTE LITTLE DRESS","Loved this cute little dress. I styled it with basic white sneakers and simple jewelry and received so many compliments. The dress ran pretty true to size but please note it is very form fitting and a little short as some of the other reviews state. I was fine with the length but I am 5'5"" Overall, a great dress!","25-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","lizzyliz11","Super comfy for a night out!","I wore this for a bachelorette party out and it was so comfy and cute but looked perfect for the occasion. While it fit super great, it was a medium and I usually wear a small and it was a perfect fit, which is why I think it fits small. I would suggest sizing up!","24-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","Courtchu22","Cute puff sleeves!!","This dress fit me so well! Very flattery shape. My favorite part is the puff sleeve detail! The fabric started to fray at the bottom seam, but I think that’s just the nature of the woven fabric!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","Harper","The reviews steered me wrong - don't size up","This dress is beautiful online and in person. But unfortunately I listened to the reviews that said it runs small, so I sized up and ordered a medium (I am normally a small). Well, I should have just ordered my true size because this is HUGE, and not wearable. Fits fine around the waist but everything above that is way too big. Another waste in my box, so sad :(","21-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","mayw7","Rooftop Party Dress","Adorable dress that you can take from day to night. Business on top, party on the bottom- but not too scandalous since I'm petite. The fabric is also super light, breathable, and perfect for summer.","5-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","Sarah","Cute, but SHORT!","Loved this dress, it fit well but it was incredibly mini. I have a bit of a butt, so probably a contributing factor, but I almost didn't leave the house in it because it was so short on me. I'm 5'7 with a booty, so might work better on shorter gals!","26-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","morgan96","Runs small and short","I ordered this to wear to a wedding. Cute dress, love the fabric, but wish I would have sized up. I usually wear a small but I should have sent for a medium. It was a little tighter than I would have liked, but my main issue was how short it is. I was not very worried about the size because the model in the photo is taller than me, but I wouldn’t dare bend over in this dress. It just barely covered my butt. Holding it up, it looks see-through, but surprisingly not see-through when you have it on.","13-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rooftop-party-dress?color=038","msmegxx","Super cute and lightweight!","I ordered a size up in this dress because I could tell the material would't be too forgiving and I'm really happy I did. It's super lightweight and a bit clingy but so fun and easy for summer. I would suggest sizing up if you don't want it to fit body con style.","9-Aug-2019"
