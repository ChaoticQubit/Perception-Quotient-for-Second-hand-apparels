The color of this cardigan says it's black. When it arrives you will think that you made a mistake and ordered navy instead of black. It has this marbled look about it that is more of a navy/black combo. I like the color combo and will keep the piece as it's a nice staple to add to my wardrobe. However, just keep in mind that it isn't black/black if you need it to match with anything in particular. Wish I had a picture of it on so you can see what I mean. Nice piece though!","12-Nov-2019"

All of my gripes were simply based on style preferences that I could have noticed if I had paid closer attention to the photos before renting. The color definitely looks a tad more speckled with cream than in the photo. The thick knit seams (can see in pic) face out which made it feel much more boho than I wanted (and a few people asked if I was wearing it inside out). Also is constructed so the left and right sides come together at the nape of the neck, sort of like a kimono. If you're more into a free people/boho vibe you'll like this more than me.","21-Nov-2019"

All of my gripes were simply based on style preferences that I could have noticed if I had paid closer attention to the photos before renting. The color definitely looks a tad more speckled with cream than in the photo. The thick knit seams (can see in pic) face out which made it feel much more boho than I wanted (and a few people asked if I was wearing it inside out). Also is constructed so the left and right sides come together at the nape of the neck, sort of like a kimono. If you're more into a free people/boho vibe you'll like this more than me.","21-Nov-2019"

The color of this cardigan says it's black. When it arrives you will think that you made a mistake and ordered navy instead of black. It has this marbled look about it that is more of a navy/black combo. I like the color combo and will keep the piece as it's a nice staple to add to my wardrobe. However, just keep in mind that it isn't black/black if you need it to match with anything in particular. Wish I had a picture of it on so you can see what I mean. Nice piece though!","12-Nov-2019"

Since it was so oversized I was able to wear it with leggings for a cozy look, or tucked in with jeans for work. I am only 5‚Äô0 so this could have easily been worn with tights and boots as a sweater dress , as when it wasn‚Äôt tucked, it went to my mid-thigh - sad I didn‚Äôt get to try that look.

Loved the off the shoulder- no chance of wearing a normal bra but that's assumed. I even wore it to work on casual Friday and it was a hit. A bit too long though and because the fabric is so heavy, it was really difficult to tuck into jeans, even with a french tuck. Color was a little more muted than in the picture but I loved it.","11-Feb-2020"

It's almost a periwinkle blue. It was definitely oversized and I likely could've gotten away going a size down to a small. I did a pseudo-french tuck and slipped the bottom under my bra strap so it wouldn't bunch up tucked into my jeans. Even though there's a cut out in the back of the sweater my bra didn't show, which was great. Overall very cute - lots of compliments!","27-Jan-2020"

I am kicking myself for not buying it - it‚Äôs definitely a closet staple. It was SUPER oversized. The color has a unique worn faded look to it , which I loved. Since it was so oversized I was able to wear it with leggings for a cozy look, or tucked in with jeans for work. I am only 5‚Äô0 so this could have easily been worn with tights and boots as a sweater dress , as when it wasn‚Äôt tucked, it went to my mid-thigh - sad I didn‚Äôt get to try that look.

It seemed to run a little low-cut for me to wear to work -- I have big boobs, and had to wear a tank top under this so my entire torso/titties wouldn't be exposed when I bent over. The arm length was surprisingly adequate for my long-ass arms. I think the fit on this shirt is potentially more flattering on girls with smaller boobs -- I felt like I was wearing a sack with this specific fabric.","13-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/golden-girl-mini?color=070","Janelle","Sexy 80s Glam","This is definitely NOT a subtle dress, but I loved it. I wore it for a white/gold themed NYE cocktail party and got a lot of compliments on the 80s vibes. I wear between a 4 and a 6, and wore a size 4 and I felt this ran a little large. This is a wrap dress, so if you want it to be a little more demure then you should probably size up. If you have a bigger chest (and I do *NOT*) then this dress is a deep, deep plunging V (which I loved!) If you want something closer to the model in the photo, you'd probably want to size up so you can wrap it tighter. I wanted to buy this dress as I loved the style, but don't think the build quality is worth the price but it's amazing to rent.","3-Jan-2020"

On the model, it looks like an A-line skirt, however, on me, it was pretty much bodycon, which is not what I expected. It was a little too tight on me, so I ended up not wearing it, but I'm not sure if sizing up would have done the trick.

I'm talking like: couldn't wear it for a few hours even without it getting ripped up and dirty and tripping over it 15 times or wearing at least 4 inch heels. I'm not averse to heels, but don't want to feel like I have to have them on just to wear a garment comfortable, and I can't imagine how this long length would work for someone shorter than me. the other major fit issue is with the way the two panels of fabric come together at the waist; while the circumference of the skirt fit true to size and seems well-designed, that connection seam between the two halves of the skirt at the front totally pooches out when the skirt is being worn creating a super awkward looking side-view. it's like a funky little kangaroo pouch. not flattering for anyone of any size! when trying the skirt on literally the only solution for wearing this I could find was treating it like a strapless dress, throwing a belt on top of it to cinch in my waist, and styling under a giant sweater. it honestly was kinda cute like this -- but definitely not what I was hoping for or what the item description promises.","11-Mar-2020"

I received many compliments even from random women on the street. The only down side is that it‚Äôs super long in the back. I‚Äôm not short but I still had to wrap it up higher then my natural waist and wear platforms to help it not drag on the ground (or trip over the train). I would say the fit runs a little on the bigger side, there are 3 button loops on the inside that make the size forgiving (I wore it on the tightest button and still had a little room). The small fit me but I think next time I would order an XS to see if the length and waist are better! Other then that this skirt is super comfortable, feminine, and versatile.

The waist and skirt fit perfectly. The straps and the straight neckline did not work in my favor. The straps were several inches too long, and this caused a grossly gaping neckline. I tried covering it with a cardigan, but the button details were covered, too. If you cover the bodice buttons it makes the skirt buttons look like you are wearing your skirt off center.

I've been wanting a denim dress for ages, and this dress's unique neckline and detailing really jumped off the page at me. But I have a pear-shaped figure. Even after sizing up, the dress did not fit great. The fabric is a nice-quality rigid denim with no give, and it showed. It was very loose and boxy on top and super tight on the bottom. For reference, I wear a 4-6 on top and a 6-8 on the bottom, and ordered a medium. If I had sized up again to allow for a longer hem + looser fit in the hips, then I would have been swimming in it. If you have a straight or hourglass figure, I think that this might work for you, but I think it'll be a little trickier for us pear or apple-shaped gals.","17-Apr-2020"

It could use a pair of tights if I want to wear it to work. Overall the fit was OK, not super flattering, but I have a hard time with items that are boxier in shape - I've got an hourglass figure so that silhouette can make me look bigger. It was a little tighter in the hips than I would've liked, so if you've got a booty this probably isn't the right dress for you.","26-Oct-2019"
