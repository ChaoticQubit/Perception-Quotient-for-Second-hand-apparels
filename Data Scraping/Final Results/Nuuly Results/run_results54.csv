"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sweater-knit-polo2?color=001","Averacka","See-Through and thin","This item just wasn't what I was expecting, but that's my fault not the clothing's. It is very see-through and not sweatery like I expected. I couldn't really figure out how to style it.","3-Apr-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sweater-knit-polo2?color=001","Tucked","Too snug and short","I tried this on but never wore it. It was too tight and short. It looks cool on the model in the pictures but just looked kind of cheap and corny on me in real life.","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sweater-knit-polo2?color=001","Cheyeco","Cute Polo Sweater with Retro vibes","This is super cute and versatile. You can layer over it for winter appropriate attire. But I loved this piece it fit well and was true to size. I am 5'4 with a 34DD bust and usually wear about a size M in tops. The knit is a thick knit with natural materials so no polyester feel here! Get it!","4-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sweater-knit-polo2?color=001","leggos","Both Classic & Cool","It has a slightly heavier weight than I expected, sweater knit and not a fine jersey. That didn't bother me a bit because it is very cute, easy to wear with anything and has a very trendy look without actually being trendy. A great summer/fall transition piece.","11-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/goddess-one-shoulder-mini?color=010","emj","SO CUTE","Such a cute dress, highly recommend. It was a little see through (as any white dress is). But totally fine if you wore nude underwear. Love this dress!!!","4-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/goddess-one-shoulder-mini?color=010","TrousseauStyle","Very sheer","Overall this was pretty tight and short (probably should have gotten a larger size), but also was so sheer you could see nude underwear...","30-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/goddess-one-shoulder-mini?color=010","Sarah","Cute but incredibly see through","A really cute, well fitting dress but I unfortunately couldn't wear it because it was SO sheer. Would need to wear. slip or something underneath, even going no undies wasn't possible. So, def just make sure you have the right slip/spanx under garments before you rent!","26-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/goddess-one-shoulder-mini?color=010","PK","Dress was incredibly small","The dress was very cute but did not fit at all. I can usually wear a medium or large (sizes 8-10) but this would not even fit over my waist.","15-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/goddess-one-shoulder-mini?color=010","Mochi","Awkward","It fits but the silhouette is awkward once it's on like not flattering. It's also see through so you need to wear a bra and etc.","3-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/natasha-dress?color=000","GMD","Cute but sleeves were poofy","Dress was cute but the sleeves were just too much for me. They were overwhelming.","13-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/natasha-dress?color=000","amandahi","too much fabric for me","I was drowning in this dress with the loose, flowy style. I am short so it would probably work better on someone taller. The material and print are nice.","27-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/natasha-dress?color=000","Seven","Maybe with the right belt?","I wanted to like this one because it looks really cute, but the fabric is stiff, it doesn't lay quite right and as another review said, there are a lot of strings. The print is super cute. It looks better with a belt, imo, but I didn't have the right one for it. Needs a sandal and it's too cold here for sandals now.","1-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/natasha-dress?color=000","ethorpe","Cute but baggy","This dress is a really cute pattern, but just a weird cut that gets better when you tie the waist belt but at the same time, it's kind of too many strings all over the place. I never ended up wearing it.","29-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/natasha-dress?color=000","frida","Natasha Dress","cute but to tight in chest and to big in sleeves","11-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/natasha-dress?color=000","dturkeyyy","Pretty fabric!","The fabric and print were great. I'm typically not a fan of a cap sleeve, so I initially was disappointed when it arrived. I think sizing up would reduce the puff of the cap sleeve, but I still ended up liking it!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/natasha-dress?color=000","JLCINK","Beautiful Dress! Could have sized down for less poofy feeling","When I first put it on - I almost didn't wear it to work because it felt so big and poofy. I know the sleeves are supposed to be balloon like - but this felt a bit over the top. I was on my way to work and had 3x different women stop me to say how much they loved my dress - so something must have been working! I give it 4x stars because it actually didn't come with the belt in my order - which may have helped to give it mores shape and pull it in more in the back. Wore once to work and again to brunch with my boyfriend. Beautiful colors/pattern/fabric. Still recommend!","24-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/natasha-dress?color=000","SkyP","Cute, comfortable and versatile.","I loved the bold print and puff sleeves. It was cute with and without the belt. I also wore with my own belt. It's a nice, polished fabric, so I wore to work and to a meeting with a client. I'm 5'1"" and it hit right in the middle of my knee, so not too short. Not sheer at all, you don't need a slip. This dress travelled well too - came out of my suitcase with no need for steaming/ironing.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","ouidawy","Cute and trendy","I wore these for my daughters 10 months photos! They were trendy but classy at the same time. I paired with a navy tank underneath.","20-May-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","Scout_wolfe","Fun but a little baggy","I wore these around on the weekend and to some casual dinners. A little baggy in the bottom half and the top fit perfectly without exposing anything. They hit 5 inches above my ankle, but I didn't mind that. Very comfortable!","11-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","krissyLH","Really cute!","Very comfortable and cute...the material is thick so I could get away with not wearing a bra. Wish the straps were a little more adjustable!","4-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","MDB","Material is soft","I didn't try this on, got for a trip that we did not end up taking. But it felt great and looked worn in - but in a good way like it would be comfy to wear.","3-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","Abbo93","LWJ","This jumpsuit is perfect. I am short and it hit my ankles perfectly!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","rgtwardrobe","""Sassy Rugrat""","Walked into work in this and my coworker said I looked like a ""sassy rugrat."" Best compliment ever? Yep. This has a very youthful but also sexy vibe to it. I wore it with a black turtleneck underneath and it was such a fun outfit.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","alexcan333","pleasantly surprised","i really loved this! it's so perfect us short girls! didn't even need to wear heels with it and it fell on my ankles at the perfect length.","4-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","Bweb","Would live in this","WHAT I SAID ABOVE. Would live in this. Love myself some jumpsuits and was hoping this would work out for my trip to Mexico City next month. Safe to say it will be joining me. Also a pair of nude underwear underneath is all you need!","28-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","sjane","The Perfect Overalls","Do yourself a favor and rent these! I'm obsessed with them. I loved them so much and got so many compliments on them. I styled these with a black t-shirt and sandals, black turtleneck and booties and white long-sleeve shirt and flats. I seriously almost bought these and will honestly probably rent them again...","27-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","DBH614","Fit but not quite","I couldn’t really figure out how to wear this. Too revealing without a T under it but not quite right with the shirts I already owned. It fit perfectly as far as waist and pant length went.","27-Feb-2020"

I didn't wear them as often as I thought I would but I still would totally recommend them. Super comfortable + the print is so bold! I am on the shorter side so even the xs was a little baggy but it still looked super cute with a turtleneck and my platform docs!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","ps","super cute if you don't have a long torso","I love love love this, but struggle with jumpsuits because i'm long legs and long torso. This cute jumpsuit was just too short in my torso. I was so excited about this piece when I saw it online and just as excited in person, then so disappointed when it didn't work. It was the perfect piece to take for our Disneyworld trip, if it fit right :(","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","mdudzik","Everything!","I absolutely adored this. It was cute with or without a top underneath. It was so comfortable and I received compliment after compliment in it. I wished I took photos. Anyways, I definitely recommend this and kind of wish I purchased it. It will need some ironing once you get it but super easy. I will be renting it again and probably buying. Only con is it is hard to get on and off so going to the restroom is tough if you don’t have a handy friend to help ya button back up. It is in my top 2 fave as of now.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","MB777","Pattern looked cheap","Im curvy and it didn't fit very well, the pockets made it gap weird causing my belly region to look bigger than what it is. I could maybe get past that but the pattern/material looked/felt cheap. The pictures make it look way cuter than in person.","13-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","carolinedefelice","Sweet but a lil baggy","Love the cross detailing on the back! The ruching on the chest is also beautiful. Wear skin tone undies and you’re set. Wrinkles easily when you sit down.","6-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","JennyfromSC","FUN","I was a little too short for this but wore it anyway! It's just a really fun piece. When it comes to NUULY more risk more reward. Try it out! Esp if you are taller than 5'2.","26-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","Emilyann","Cute but not durable","Really cute but one of the buttons for the straps broke the first time I wore it, so I wasn’t able to wear again.","22-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","nuulexy","CUte, flirty jumpsuit","Loved this! Adjustable straps were great, I could get it to sit perfectly, with great open back. I'm short so am wary of junmpsuits - but this one was perfect. If I had more occasions to wear it, I would have bought it!","17-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","brunnerali","Wanted to love","So cute but ran small. Was able to zip the zipper but felt that if I moved at all seams would rip.","6-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","MCL","Funky","The waist is tight so I would forego wearing it with a sweater underneath. Still I really liked it, it's pretty light so I layered it over thin long johns to keep warm.","2-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","icedteacakes","Unflattering butt, no shirt worked with it","The fit was good and the item itself is very cute, but I never wore it. I have a good butt but these overalls made it look dumpy. And I tried to style it with four different shirts but not a single one worked with it.","28-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","snowfallabove","Awkward sizing","I wanted to love this piece but found the sizing to be awkward. Being petite, I was happy to learn the straps are adjustable but unfortunately, I couldn't wear this piece because I wasn't able to zip it up all the way in the back. The waist seemed to run very small. I'm a 25""/26"" waist and 34C and found the waist/bust area seemed to run very small for the XS. I may try this again in the S because it was pretty cute.","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","HannaBanana","Loved!","I loved these! The fit was great and they were SO FUN TO WEAR. The fabric does not have much give so although they were flattering, they were hard to sit on my couch in. Not for lounging. But very cute for work and going out! Would rent again!","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","Libby","Translucent","Super cute with a good-enough fit and great texture; so incredibly see-through. Couldn't tuck anything in without the fabric being seen. Tragic.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","emmap123","Really loved this","Loved this but it was a tiny bit snug!! It is a zipper in the back and if it was a little stretchy it would have been perfect","14-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","tailor","sheer white jumpsuit","pretty and girly - the adjustable straps are nice. it's a little tight at first, but it loosens up as you wear it. good for shorter women. 100% sheer - cannot wear with undergarments - so it's nice for the beach/pool.","10-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","wildcat","Adorable pattern. Weird fit.","I wanted to love this jumpsuit. It's so cute in the picture. But, it didn't fit me...at all! The straps are super long and the whole thing was just wrong on me. I couldn't make it work. Never wore it.","9-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","bkschmit","SO Comfortable","I wore these to work a few times and I swear I felt like I was in sweats yet I've never gotten more compliments. They are a *tiny* bit see-through (only when I wore a black turtleneck underneath) but if you wear white underwear, you're fine.","9-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","adimason","Little Small","I’m usually a medium but I ordered a large and it fits perfect. Legs are a little tight. Very soft and comfortable material.","4-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","styleschwartz","Cheaper looking in person than I expected","I thought I was going to love this based on the reviews, and I thought I'd ordered the right size, but I did not. I'm 5'7"" and 150lbs but pretty muscular and not curvy but this was just like a straight up sac on me. Wasn't very flattering. Maybe I need a smaller size? I thought the print as well was not as great looking IRL as I thought it would be.","27-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","EllieHeiHei","loved this!","did not expect this to fit my petite size but it actually did. loved that the straps were adjustable. it's a little awkwardly large in the waist/hip area, so if you're not careful it looks a little diaper-ish but it all depends on your body","22-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","jobelled","Love it","This was super cute and comfortable. It does run small in the waist area, but it fit everywhere else just fine.","19-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","Leesawe","Super cute overalls","Absolutely loved this jumpsuit! Received so many compliments. Loved the bare back with criss-cross detail from the straps. Also really comfortable which is a major plus!","19-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","GeorgieSherman","Sized up and still don't fit","These overalls are a disappointing. I've ordered them now two months in a row: my usual size and a size up. Both times they are too snug on my hips and thighs but loose at the waist, even when tied. I just don't think they work if you are hourglass shaped.","11-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","jazzybb","Cute and can be styled in different ways!","I love a nice animal print and these overalls were super cool. I liked the ruffle detailing and the fabric was comfortable and easy to move in. I wore this for the first day of my business trip and it was comfortable for the plane trip to the office. I wore it with a black quarter sleeved shirt under it. Fit - Overall, the fit was a little bit weird on me. The crotch section felt a little long and poofy. I think it was because of my height. The straps were VERY long but I figured out that you can change the button to shorten them (yay!). The buttons really help to ensure that the top portion fits.","30-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","Beachkat","Fit a shortie","So cute and the adjustable straps saved it. I’m so short and I was able to adjust them so the length was perf. A bit of a pain to get on and off tho so I only wore it once. Wore It over a bralette with platform sandals","29-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","FrolickingJo","Sweet, romantic jumper","I loved this. Had a hard time sending it back, almost had to buy it. It has adjustable straps so you can make it fit just right. I had to pull the straps up a little high bc I'm not busty enough to fill out the front, which then caused a little bit of poochiness in the back. But it all worked. Paired with heels and jewelry, it was just so pretty. Got name compliments every time I wore it.","22-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","SPOWPOW","Love the look, but didn't fit around the back","Love these, but I couldn't get the zip up the back. It came up quite high where my back widens. Really long straps too, a bit of a faff to get on, Have a similar pair of my own and the zipper is okay so thought these would be fine, but alas no, my leopard print overall dream did not come true.","22-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","NatalieH","love love love","I am super tempted to buy these overalls. They're so comfortable and much cuter than anything else in my closet. I'm petite (5'1"") and the straps are adjustable so you can make them work if you're on the short or tall side! It's fall, so I've been wearing them over a turtleneck with booties, but someone else in the office wore them without an undershirt on a warmer day and it looked SO cute.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/costello-overalls?color=027","JLass","Not what I expected","This will probably work out for other people but just looked odd on me. It was a little too tight in the waist and made my short frame look like a plank of wood. Looked way better with heels!","12-Aug-2019"

I wore it with a black quarter sleeved shirt under it. Fit - Overall, the fit was a little bit weird on me. The crotch section felt a little long and poofy. I think it was because of my height. The straps were VERY long but I figured out that you can change the button to shorten them (yay!). The buttons really help to ensure that the top portion fits.","30-Oct-2019"

It has adjustable straps so you can make it fit just right. I had to pull the straps up a little high bc I'm not busty enough to fill out the front, which then caused a little bit of poochiness in the back. But it all worked.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/blue-patterned-wrap-mini-dress?color=049","bananarama","Can I wear this everyday, please!?","Wish I never had to take it off! I thought I might get a fancy date night opportunity, but I ended up wearing it to work a wedding. I got so many compliments and I felt like a stunner. I had planned on wearing it with black high heel ankle boots for an edge, but wore black Rothy’s for work. It is definitely meant to show off your legs, but I was amazed at how comfortable I felt considering it is pretty short. It’s cut longer in the back, so although you’re getting all your leg out there, it doesn’t feel like your bum is going to make an appearance. The cut in the front with the wrap style somehow keeps everything covered; it felt like a miracle dress. The sleeves have elastic that really add to the fun & functionality. I did use the double sided tape to keep things contained up top, but I wouldn’t been worried about it if it wasn’t a work function where I had to bend over a lot. Also, the fabric is very soft and silky! I thought for sure the silver threads were going to make it super itchy. Hoping this is available to rent forever, cause I just didn’t wanna shell out the cash... TL;DR: perfect for a snazzy night, particularly amazing on a petite or short waisted frame.

The detailing and colors are even prettier in person but it is NOT for someone on the tall side. I'm 5'8"" and a generally long person (long torso, long legs). The elastic at the waist hit me at about my ribcage instead of my actual waist, which meant that when I lifted my arms the dress came way up. I don't think it would have fit me even if I'd sized up to a M. Bottom line is, if you're tall (maybe even above 5'2""), I'd suggest avoiding this dress!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fringe-attitude-jacket?color=001","crystal_visions","Is it possible to love a jacket too much?","I often struggle with Levi's because the jackets tend to be too short in the arms and tight in the bust for me! But I love anything fringed, so I had to take a risk. The size M fit me like a dream, landing slightly below my natural waist with a just-the-right-amount relaxed fit. The arms were the perfect length. My torso is on the shorter side, so this might be slightly cropped on a longer gal. The fabric is super soft and the fringe is durable. I have a feeling I am going to end up buying this because it looks great with flowy dresses and skirts.

I typically like very fitted jackets but wanted to branch out with this one, however,this came much larger than what it looks like in the picture. The picture makes it look cinched somehow but I never got it to look quite like that. I ended up pulling the straps towards the back and knotting them behind me which really made the jacket look more fitted. That limited my range of arm motion but I thought it was better this way than looking so big. Overall, enjoyed this jacket because it's so different then what I normally wear!","12-Oct-2019"

It was a snug fit but since it was elastic it was really forgiving. I wore it with a simple black turtleneck and it was so cute! I got many compliments and even got to wear it out in the snow with a red wool coat. It's not super poofy but still has some play. It's a skirt that can go with any season!

The pair I received were a little faded and worn in which might have also added to their casualness. I styled them with a navy v-neck sweater over a form-fitting light blue, ribbed businessy tank from Aritzia and white Gola sneakers. I also think these could be dressed up, though (booties and a blouse would definitely work).

I could probably size down one more size to get a REALLY good fit but I do like these pants. Goes with a lot and really comfortable to wear casually or dressed up.

However, it fits awkward around my shoulders. If my shoulders are back, it creates a large gap in the back neckline. If I sit my shoulders forward a bit, it sits strange in the front.

I thought it was really pretty. Rented thinking I wanted to wear to a wedding, but the weather made it so that I needed something else","19-Nov-2019"

I am often between a size S and M and because of the wire in the chest I went with the M because I didnt want to spill out of the top. Unfortunately the Medium was a bit too large for me. The dress is a thick, stretchy material and the straps are not adjustable. Definitely looks like it does on the model just be careful with sizing.","5-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/daisy-midi-dress?color=009","DaniTheGirl","So cute, but you either need no boobs or extreme shoulders","I know that this dress has had a plethora of reviews about it being so cute, but not having adjustable straps... and that's totally accurate. Which would be fine if I had no boobs. I am a 36C and my breasts fit in the bodice, but the fact that the straps were at least 4 inches too long, and not adjustable, just made it extremely ""boobilicious"" and not in a cute way. The straps are needed to keep the chest portion up, since the fabric is a little bit bigger. Easiest way to make this the most ""borrowed"" dress on this site? Have adjustable straps, which the designer/company of this dress really should take note of.","10-Oct-2019"

Unfortunately the built-in bra cup neckline is cut too small for my chest and wasn't flattering. The shoulder straps were a bit long and didn't have an adjustable feature.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/daisy-midi-dress?color=009","melissa","Comfortable + Cute","I really liked this dress - the fabric was soft and stretchy, the cut and print super flattering. Sometimes the bustier look doesn't work with my chest, especially when I have to size down (which I did here), but everything fit just fine and I didn't feel like I was spilling out. Another plus was that midi length doesn't always flatter my body, but because of the ruffle I think this worked. Only downside was that the straps were pretty long, so I tugged on them a bit throughout the night. Maybe sizing down one more would have solved this. With that said, I would still wear again and recommend it for rental!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The only thing I didn’t like was that the arm holes were quite wide and the V in the front of the dress went pretty low. The first time I wore it to work, I was a little paranoid that people could see my bra. So, if wearing to work, I’d recommend a camisole underneath.","4-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mitra-utility-shirtdress?color=031","sallysimply","Cute & Comfy","I really enjoyed this dress! I’ll start with the main negative, which is that it was tighter than I expected around the thigh area. Not great for those of us with thicker thighs! Still, it wasn’t so bad that it became uncomfortable and my mobility wasn’t really limited. Beyond that, this was super cute, and I felt good in it. I didn’t need to wear a bra, which is one of my favorite things - second only to pockets, which this also had. And even though it was snug around the thigh area, the pockets didn’t do that weird scrunched up/sticking out thing that can happen with wide hips or thick thighs. For that, I was very grateful!","10-Nov-2019"

I also paired it with a brown leather belt and boots to make it a little more fall. To meetings. On a date. With a hat. Without. It doesn’t wrinkle that much so it would also be a good travel dress. I had to keep it.","10-Oct-2019"

There are adjustable buttons that mean you can adjust the depth of the slit, which is a bit to one side which is even better when you walk. The fit was a dream, it sucked me in without feeling confining and the silhouette is very smooth. Very forgiving and feminine.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strike-a-pose-mini-dress?color=040","Zpolynice","Wish it was Flattering","I loved the color, the sleeves, and the fabric. The wrap around the tummy is not flattering in the least - I wore Spanx underneath to try and help, but it still made me look so wide. Not chubby, just wide. I wore it on a night out in LA and during the day Vegas, so having a larger bust was fine because this was a revealing cut for me. Couldn’t wear it in a more casual setting or around my parents.","22-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/strike-a-pose-mini-dress?color=040","Cynthia_Warshany","Definitely A Statement Dress","I got a lot of compliments on this dress! Definitely a statement piece, I wore it for a bridal shower I attended. Super cute and the sleeves are whimsical. The only thing that you can’t tell on the model is that it does kind of hug your stomach a little which looked a little unflattering after I was bloated from eating... to the point my belly being was clearly visible. I think because the way it lays (wrap style) and the material. I’ll also say the opening part is also VERY OPEN! I have very tiny boobs so maybe I just didn’t fill it out, but, I was a little afraid my boob was gonna pop out so I recommend double sided tape If you go with the dress!","22-Sep-2019"

I think it also ran a little big too, but I belted the center and kind of tucked in the top to make it work. I’m hoping the other color in my size comes back in so I can rent that next!

The waist is a bit tight when you first put them on (I needed to do a little shimmy to get them over my hips). They stretch out quite a bit, but not too much more of a relaxed fit (no saggy bottoms here)! I’m between a 25 and 26 so I’m glad I went with the 25. They’re longer then expected, but pants are normally too cropped on me so the length was perfect.","13-Aug-2019"

They are a true wide leg and there is a lot of material. Typically I'm between a size 25 and 26 and opted to size up to a 26, but unfortunately they stretch quite a bit throughout the day and it would have been wise to size down. Regardless, these pants are great quality and I'm tempted to keep!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

Lately I've worn bottoms ranging from a 26 to a 28 so I got these in a 27. They fit fine but were overall a little loose. It made them really comfortable for sitting at work all day, but I generally like this style of pant to fit tighter throughout the waist. The quality is amazing and the color is as pictured.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

They were hanging by a thread or missing completely. Not a big enough deal to stop me from wearing it out but wasn't confident wearing it somewhere nicer like to work as I had planned. Another thing I found weird was the sides. The sleeves are attached very low which means any time I moved my arms, the shirt lifted up showing my stomach.

It’s pretty, and the one time I wore it I received several compliments, but it’s very awkward. The arm holes are very low and it’s shorter in the back than the front, this makes it hard to do anything that requires any kind of arm movement without accidentally flashing everyone around you. Like I said, it’s a cute top but in my option the cons kind of outweigh the pros.","6-Oct-2019"

I tried this dress on and the bust/waist band was almost impossible to get over my shoulders. There's no zipper to zip yourself up - you just pulled it over your head. After struggling to get it on, the neckline was SO low while the bust/waist band was SO tight. In the photos it looks like it would stretch, but it does not. Also, the bust/waist band sat on my ribs. I think it's meant to sit on my waist, but I could've pull it down there. Overall, pretty disappointed with this.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

Perfect for Mexico because they were breezy and let tons of air in. It was a little challenging to sit down in them without showing too much skin, and the legs would drag on the floor. Lastly, there's really beautiful tasseling on the hem- but it was scrunched up and messy (like it had been washed, which is fine by me!).

First off, it's so cute and feminine and you feel like you should go on an instrammable picnic while you're wearing it. Secondly, it's incredibly comfortable with the stretch in the bodice. The nice thing about this part too is that sizing with this dress is super flexible. I think the size L would fit someone who wears a size XXL and I also think it could fit a size M. I would say it's technically true to size, but if you're inbetween sizes, I recommend sizing down because there's enough stretch that it will work!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I ordered a size small because I am often concerned about the length in jumpsuits. The top portion was very very tight on my ribcage, which surprised me because I was already sizing up and I am very narrow up top. The bottom half was a very wide and loose fit and honestly probably looked too big. I couldn't imagine sizing down though as the top half was so tight. This also had a drag in the crotch, and the straps would sometimes fall down, indicating it was too long, which also surprised me considering I am almost 5'8"". Overall cute enough to get away with it, but odd fit, and definitely would not recommend if you are petite.","4-Sep-2019"

I wore this dress out to drinks and appetizers with my mom at a winery and it was perfect. I also wore it to an outdoor bar with my friends. The sleeves stay up due to a plastic lining on the inside, so I never had to worry about them falling off during the night. The bow in the front can be completely undone, so you can re-tie it as tight or loose as you want. It was lightweight and fun, and not see through at all! Length is a tad bit short in the front but I wouldn't size up or else the top part of the dress will be too big (I ordered a M as well just in case). I wore it without a bra and had no issues.

I don't think I've ever met a sweater that I liked more, and I've owned a *lot* of striped sweaters. The amount of things that I already own and the changing of the season meant that I didn't actually keep this, but it was a GREAT piece to have this month. I'll probably rent again (and revisit purchasing) soon.","12-Mar-2020"

The dress is actually super cute. I wore it to a trip to Florida and will wear to a golf theme party. The only issue is that it’s a little short (can’t wear to work) and too tight in the chest. I had to wear with a bandeau instead of a bra because it was hard to get it to close, and I sized up.","21-Feb-2020"

The sleeves are cool but the plaid felt more loud in real life than I expected. Overall I didn't love the dress for me, but I'm sure for someone bolder it would be cool!

I think this would look super cute if I ordered down a size or two.","12-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/denim-pullover-jacket?color=010","barbrose","No Give, Very Boxy","This turned out to be very short on me and was extremely boxy, it didn't have any give so it wound up being restrictive and looked like a cardboard box with sleeves on me.","26-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","NorCalGal","Cute but long","This dress is so cute and comfortable. Nice thick, stretchy fabric that holds everything in nicely. It's VERY LONG - I wore it with 3"" heels and still stepped on the hem a few times. Probably unwearable for short gals.","3-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","emilyroze","Too thin","this was a cute dress - although the material was much thiner than expected. Did not wear.","18-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","PNWlust4life","Too Tight, and Not in a Good Way!","I love the idea of this dress but it has little stretch in the bust or sleeves, so it was a no go for me. I'm considering throwing on a black turtleneck and belt to at least wear it as a skirt. The bottom is very loose.","27-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","Jessboggs1","Perfect winter maxi","Super comfortable and stylish. Wore w/ coat and booties. Dress is body hugging but very flattering. Will rent again- highly recommend","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","PhillyGirl9","Amazing dress","Wore to a holiday party and received compliments all night! Very comfy and flattering and would wear it over and over if i could. It’s a little long (I’m 5’6 and wore worn kitten heels) so if someone’s short it may not be the best dress.","17-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","btswithkaela","Flattering fit, but did not wear it","This dress has a lot of positives: the material is stretchy enough that it's flattering but also holds you in, the double leg slit is necessary since this dress would otherwise have no movement. Ultimately, I did not end up wearing this dress. I would style it with a mid calf heeled boot, or a black heel. Can be dressed up or down. I am a 36C and I feel like if you have a bigger chest than me this may stretch out too much and not work.","16-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","OverAlls","A little costume-y","I took a risk going with the M/L, but I'm usually a size 8 in pants and a Small/XS up top, so didn't want this dress to be too small on bottom. It is way too long - I'd have to wear 4 inch heels to make it work on my 5'6"" frame. I don't love the fabric, it reminds me of a dance costume. I thought this could be a fun maxi that I wear with booties and a leather jacket on the weekend but it's really more appropriate for an ""event"" as the name ""Gala"" suggests.","5-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","ashmc","A great elevated basic","The knit drapes well and is very comfortable. The fit is the perfect blend of sexy/not too sexy. I wore it alone to a wedding then styled with a sweatshirt for work. I’m in between a small and medium and the XS/S fit perfectly. So if you are a true XS it may run a bit big. Its also on the long side, so I had to wear heels in order to make it work.","11-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","Shannon","Very Flattering","I ordered this dress in a M/L since a S/M was not available. The reviews said the fit was supposed to be tight - body con I guess. So I took the risk.... It actually fits OK. The smaller size would have been better, but once I put on a belt and heels I was pleased. Totally recommend this dress!","10-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","Jaygordz","Runs small","I like the material, but it did not fit over my broad shoulders and torso.","10-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gala-ready-maxi?color=024","Maltomeel","Stunner!","WOW. I have a work gala coming up and wanted something super sexy without being ""overt"". This dress is perfect. Fabric is so easy to wear and the long, lean silhouette is incredibly flattering. The slits are so cool. I'm in LOVE with this.","21-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/convertible-jenny-midi-dress?color=001","Loveleigh","Odd shape.","This is a little odd. It's loose in some spots, tight in others. And has a long pointy piece that I had no idea what to do with! Great concept, poor execution.","11-Jan-2020"

I might try and style this w some skinny pants to make it work.","13-Aug-2019"
