I knowingly got an XL, so I figured it would be too big, but thought I could wear it as an oversized blouse on tight leggings or tucked into a skirt. I really loved it, but it was clearly too big in the shoulders. If you're not typically wearing an XL, expect an oversized fit, but if you're into that, it's super cute.","15-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sharona-snake-printed-jacket?color=026","Sune","Hard to Style","It is cute but I found it hard to style because it fell at a weird length. Also, it was very stiff and not as comfortable as I would have liked. Good choice for a month but wouldn't buy it.","6-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sharona-snake-printed-jacket?color=026","Bettye","Good Not Great","I have mixed feelings about this jacket. I love the color. I love the shape. I love the snakeskin texture. I love the CONCEPT of it. But, while the body was lovely and supple and drapey, the sleeves were unusually thick and stiff - a totally different fabric than the body. I wanted to be able to push the sleeve up but...they wouldn't budge. It was just a weird feeling. So I only wore it once and that was enough. I styled it over a very feminine ruffly white blouse (also from Nuuly) to do a sort of a feminine/edgy look. Eh. Meh. It just fell a little flat for me.","26-Jan-2020"

This is so versatile -- can be worn over a dress or with jeans and a t-shirt. I styled it with a white mock neck shirt and high waisted dark jeans and loved it!","26-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sharona-snake-printed-jacket?color=026","stockholmgirl1987","Loved it enough to buy it","The jacket fits somewhat smaller, but because I usually layer, I preferred to size up. I got it and ended up buying it. The color is very pretty, end even though it's not real leather it does look it. It fits well, and does it's function and is aesthetically good.","25-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sharona-snake-printed-jacket?color=026","SEM428","Great! Considered buying...","Loved this jacket! Wore several times, comfortable soft leather(?) and worked perfect for fall.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sharona-snake-printed-jacket?color=026","JenTH","Cute and Light","It’s a pretty light jacket, so definitely harder to wear now that it’s colder. Fabric very thin and feels a little flimsy. Stylish nonetheless.","12-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sharona-snake-printed-jacket?color=026","foodiemama","Great style, runs very short","Love the style, look, and feel of this jacket, but it's much, much too short in my regular size (XSP). Fit in other dimensions is TTS.","1-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sharona-snake-printed-jacket?color=026","Abbey","Cute in theory","But not on me. It's a lot of fabric in the front if you zip it part of the way. Even without zipping it, it was too much for me. Quality was OK--felt a little cheap.","31-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sharona-snake-printed-jacket?color=026","Styleadded","Cute jacket with one issue","I really like this little jacket - the color, zippers at sleeves, and snake print are all great. But the thin fabric used on the front parts (where the snake print is) is extremely floppy and just wouldn’t lay right.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sharona-snake-printed-jacket?color=026","MCL","Lots of compliments!","Great color and the print immediately gets compliments. I wasn't a big fan of how the material laid on my chest, but I did wear this the most out of all my options.","26-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/sharona-snake-printed-jacket?color=026","PetiteC","Great Fall Item!","This was my most worn item this month's Nuuly box! It's a rich brown hue and matched with everything I tried to pair it with. The animal detailing on the material is so unique and I received so many compliments on it! I preferred the cut of the jacket open vs. zipped. This is not a jacket you should wear if you're hoping to keep warm as it's definitely on the thinner side.","8-Sep-2019"

It didn’t feel high quality - it felt a little “forever 21” dare I say it for a piece sold at Anthro!! So that’s what 4 stars rather than 5, and also why I didn’t wear it more than once.","24-Aug-2019"

But, it is a tad more cropped on my particular body shape. Also, I don’t like the feel of it, in that it is all acrylic, without any natural fibers like cotton or wool. I might wear/rent it again, but the quality does not justify the purchase price.","2-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beach-club-sweater?color=040","emilyelizabeth","Overall, it's cute.","I got an XS and the fit is still a little oversized which I wish was a little more fitted but the colors of the sweater make up for it, I think the gold and blue go well together. It's just that the sweater is a little itchy, probably because of the gold thread. Other than that it's a great layering piece but you gotta be careful because it snags easily.","21-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beach-club-sweater?color=040","mimiW","really cute but falling apart","This sweater is so cute and comfortable and a great transition piece from summer to fall. However, the threads started pulling immediately upon wearing. I will continue to wear it until my rental runs out, but it's kind of a pain. Also, the gold parts of the sweater are actually a shiny gold (not a bad thing, just not what it looks like in photos).","17-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beach-club-sweater?color=040","penname","Itchy","This sweater has metallic gold yarn in it, which you can't see from the picture. It is itchy and if I had paid more attention, I would have noticed that it is mostly acrylic. I rented it to wear to a windy beach location, but due to the itch, sent it back unworn.","31-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/beach-club-sweater?color=040","Mimi","Good sweater","Really like this sweater! Fits true to size, good oversized look. Not the warmest sweater, but thick enough. The length is good-- goes past the waist line but isn't too long. Got many compliments :)","7-Aug-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","NikkiW","love love love","I absolutely loved everything about this!!! I went to nuuly and looked up this brand after receiving this. The color was way super super super cuter in person!!! Fit amazing. Loved the cut at the bottom. looked great with black jeans and a belt. I would have bought this but I purchased a coat. S was perfect. I'm usually a S in sweaters. I wore it one day and had multiple compliments.","10-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","vivian9gar","Simple and Cute","Ran a bit small and short, but the fit was soft and cozy. The color has almost a purple/pink look to it in person instead of the cream color it looks like in the photo.","6-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","Taryn","Unflattering","I feel like you need to try this on in person. Maybe the smaller size would have been ,ore flattering, nor sure tho. The knit is heavy / thick, and in combination with the ruffles, it just didn't work.","2-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","nerual","The cutest sweater!","I really loved this sweater from the colors to the ruffles. I would recommend to size up for sure.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","lapkay","cute crop sweater","Definitely have to pair this with high-waisted bottoms, whether a skirt or jeans. Wore it a couple times, and I've gotten multiple compliments b/c of the speckled color & the asymmetry of the cut. I find it to be a little too warm for me, but at baseline, I usually run a little hot & don't own many long-sleeved tops. would not purchase, but am pleased that it provided additional style clout at work.","10-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","GraceM","Wanted to love :(","This looks so presh on the model, but it was just awkward on me. Too cropped and then too bulky on the sleeves/sides. I LOVE a ruffle, but it was ultimately just not flattering on me and didn't make me look cute, dainty, or parisian (like the model). Le sigh.","11-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","Humidifier","Good on both casual and bit formal","I was a bit worried about the cropped length but perfect with high wested jeans and wide pants.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","keckels","Unique!","This was very unique. They only thing I didn't love is that you need high rise jeans or else your belly will show. I did get lots of complements on it though!","29-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","Ninja","Cute, trendy, fits well","This was cute, but felt like it had shrunk a little lengthwise so I definitely needed a tank top underneath.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","samcham","Cute and unique sweater","This sweater was super cute. It's definitely not your basic, every day sweater. The ruffles and asymmetrical hem make it really fun and unique. It was very easy to just throw it on over a pair of jeans. I thought it was more of a cream color, but it ended up having some purple/lilac threading in it that was quite pretty.","23-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","CrystalSticfigga","Asymmetrical Hem = Cropped Sweater","This is basically a cropped sweater. The model must be wearing high-waisted jeans and possibly a size larger so that it doesn’t show skin. I wore it to work on casual Friday.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","MGavin","So so soft!","I wore this to work and Thanksgiving dinner, and got so many compliments on it! It's very soft and feminine, plus the asymmetrical hem rids the need to french tuck. I loved this sweater!!","9-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","Bean","Great colors","I liked this sweater, but I didn't love it. The ruffles were a bit too wide-set and I don't know that they were the most flattering but I still wore it a couple of times. I really liked the colors and the sweater was thick and soft and very comfortable.","6-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","featherhead","Funky twist on a sweater","I wore this with tight jeans/fitted pants.

The color is better in person too.","4-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/regina-ruffle-sweater?color=055","Fuki","Felt very cute","Which took me out of my comfort zone, because I would not generally describe my style as ""cute."" But I was looking for cozy and warm sweaters for a trip to Paris in November, where I expected rain everyday and sub-40 degree weather, so I took a chance with this one. It got the job done, warmth-wise. I felt a little bit silly with the ruffles, but the asymmetrical bottom is even more obvious in person, which I think gave the sweater a little bit of a cool factor.

One thing to note, if you are taller, I would size up. I normally always wear a small and I sized up to a medium and it was perfect. The medium gave me a little extra length in the body and sleeves. Would 100% recommend!","6-Nov-2019"

However, after some clever safety pinning, I was brave enough to wear it a few times! I found that this fit true to size and since I'm smaller in the boob department, the ruffles were flattering and the lower cut never felt revealing. It is a bit sheer (hence why it only gets 4 stars), but I didn't mind that if I was just out with friends for drinks. For more conservative situations (work, family time, church), I threw on a cami underneath and I felt it still looked fine! I probably would've purchased this top had the button loop not been broken (kudos to Nuuly's customer service though--they were super helpful when I told them one of my items was damaged upon arrival!)","31-Dec-2019"

I couldn't have worn it unless I wore a cami underneath, which I didn't want to do.","8-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/ruffle-wrap-blouse?color=049","somethingfrommyshelf","A fun update to the White Blouse","When this top came in, the loop that goes around one of the buttons was torn so I thought I wouldn't be able to wear it and I was totally bummed. However, after some clever safety pinning, I was brave enough to wear it a few times! I found that this fit true to size and since I'm smaller in the boob department, the ruffles were flattering and the lower cut never felt revealing. It is a bit sheer (hence why it only gets 4 stars), but I didn't mind that if I was just out with friends for drinks. For more conservative situations (work, family time, church), I threw on a cami underneath and I felt it still looked fine! I probably would've purchased this top had the button loop not been broken (kudos to Nuuly's customer service though--they were super helpful when I told them one of my items was damaged upon arrival!)","31-Dec-2019"

I paired them with some block heels in a fawn suede and felt like a 70s goddess. These were definitely a go-to this month.

I only wear high waisted jeans, so with that being said, if you don't mind that they aren't super high waisted, then these might be for you!

The legs are insanely wide (and I like a wide leg) and LONG, the waist is super tight, the torso is hilariously short. I have no idea what proportioned human this is supposed to work for. Plus, the fabric feels cheap - if it was silkier I think I would just wear heels and make it work. I'm a small upper body and medium lower body and should have gone with a medium. But I wished I would have just heeded the previous reviews and not gotten it.","4-Oct-2019"

Fabric is nice (bit more linen so not stretch), the colors are awesome and the wide leg is great, but I couldn't wear it because it was super tight on top. It barely fit my upper chest. And because it was tight up top, it caused a lot of looser fabric to bunch at the waistline in the back where the zipper is. Really not wearable cause it just looks wrong.","25-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/gallery-row-jumpsuit?color=000","ALT","Not flattering","super pretty colors however it doesn’t fit right.

Not sure if it was meant to be worn closed or not but that was somewhat the impression I got after trying it on for the first time, as well as the impulse I had while wearing it. The fabric was not as well made as I had thought it would be either. Wore once to work.","23-Dec-2019"

The quality was just not up to par with the rest of the items I received. The material is pretty flimsy, it wrinkles VERY easily and for the life of me I couldn't get the lapels to stay flat. It's not very stiff or structured like a blazer should be. It looked and felt cheap, especially for a $300 blazer.","10-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/leopard-moves-jumpsuit?color=220","MK","Leopard Moves Jumpsuit","Love it! The reviewer who mentioned the low crotch is not wrong. It's not a drop-crotch exactly, but it's an unusual fit due to the fact that the style is seamless there, which didn't really add or detract from my overall impression. I'm 5'3"", and the dip in the back hit right at the bra band. So, you can hide a bra, but it's better to go without since you might find yourself adjusting all day. It's a medium weight knit and easy to pull on and off.","5-Sep-2019"

Looks great at the office or out about about, but is comfy enough to hang in on the couch.

My only critique is that the liner moves around a lot and makes it difficult to get your arms in the sleeves because it bunches up near the wrist as your sliding your arm in. It's easy enough to straighten out but that makes it non-conducive to wearing long sleeves underneath. I've paired this with my favorite pink tee and I'm in love with the combination. I will wear it many times while I have it.","5-Dec-2019"

I didn't need to zip it so it could have easily been worn open.

The color is more earthy in person, and again...this gave me a tiny waist, so flattering in person. Wore it unbuttoned to the waist with black high rise jeans.

Sadly, this doesn't fit me at all -- while the waist is right, I have a big butt/thighs and there is absolutely no give whatsoever in those areas. It was pretty long on me as a size small, so I don't think a medium would have worked out either. Probably a great skirt for slender 5'3""+ bodies with minimal booty.","7-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/museum-gala-gown?color=000","sarah945","Spring-y perfection that runs bigger than other ML gowns","Oh my goodness this dress is perfection. I am one of the weirdos who had to host a virtual event from my living room. This dress added the perfect aesthetic flair while also allowing me to feel like I was wearing a cloud. The fabric is sumptuous but perfectly light, and the details - braiding around the waist, a pseudo-halter neckline - are fantastic. I will say that I rent a LOT of ML Monique Lhuillier gowns, and this one runs 1-2 sizes larger than the rest of her plus line (probably due to less boning). Normally, as a size 14/16 with a broad back I size up to the 20W in her entire collection. In this case I could have gone with the 18W easily, and probably swung the 16W. That said, nothing a few strategically placed pins couldn't fix, especially when no one was in the room with me (in real life I may have been a smidge worried about a wardrobe malfunction)!

With 2” heals and my height of 5’5”, I needed it to be shortened at least 3 inches just for it not to drag on the floor. Unfortunately I could not wear this to a wedding as planned.

I love them ALL - but THIS PAIR is my favorite! The denim in this style is different than what the splattered-paint and the embroidered ones are mode of. This denim doesn't stretch out so much when I wear them - so I don't need to wash them after wearing them once in order for them to hug me in all the right places. And the embroidery on these is cross-stitch, not crewel-work - which I just LOVE! I was so thrilled last month when I discovered the Pilcro and the Letterpress jeans - and I felt like nothing could make them better.

I am 5'5"", 130lbs, muscular build. These were perfect size. I did find that the folding around the crotch area was strange the first time I put these on but as I wore them they relaxed and the issue didn't look as back.

I wore black tights and black sueded wedges, topped with long, wine colored fitted cardigan. I got several compliments! The crepey fabric, seed beading, and sequins give this dress a delicate feel.

I tried it with a belt but ended up wearing it without one as it didn't really line up well with the beading. I wore it with navy tights and brown boots, and it was so cute!

They run large: I'm 5'6"" and curvy and I typically wear a 29 in Jeans. I rented the 28 in these and they were still a bit loose in the waist so I potentially could have gone down another size. I wore them with 2"" block heels to get the right length.

I have a smaller waist but a larger bottom and thighs, but did not see the tightness as an issue because they were still comfy. While I was out one night wearing these pants, THEY RIPPED ON THE BUTT SEAM. I was so sad.

The reviews told me it runs small, but I still rented the only size available, the XS. When it came, it fit perfectly in the chest. However, the arms are weirdly tight. It's a mesh fabric, almost like a stocking, so I was scared I was going to rip the arms. It was cute, but I was too nervous to wear it anywhere for fear of tearing the arms.","10-Jan-2020"

It was not easy to get on my body...the zipper in the back and the sleeves are very tricky. I eventually did get it on, and it wasn't uncomfortable...but I honestly felt like a clown wearing it...and I'm not one to typically feel self conscious about trying out new styles.

It was my first time wearing Love & Lemons and this piece at least, ran a little small. It fit and I wore it few times, but it was a little smaller than I would've gotten had I tried it on before. I am typically a S, but would've gotten a M next time as the biggest fit issue was that this sweater was a bit cropped. The color on this though was stunning and I love the feminine touch of the puff sleeves.

The color is so beautiful, but definitely more of a deep raspberry in person. Wore it both dressed up with skirts and trousers but also casual with jeans and booties. The puff sleeve is not overwhelming and feels trendy without trying too hard to be trendy.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/fuzzy-cropped-cardigan?color=066","YasQween","So soft & I love it","I love this sweater. I am really sensitive and picky with sweaters as wool and even cashmere irritate my skin; this sweater is a gem w/no irritation. The material is a bit heavy, in a good way, making it more body hugging. For that reason the Medium fit great, but I am guessing a small would fit too, if you want even more of a fit. I normally wear small for tight fit w/tops and medium for looser.","5-Oct-2019"

It is the type of sweatshirt that can be an outfit on its own or worn as a casual jacket. It's is definitely cropped, like others mentioned, but it is also oversized so I still felt covered. The lining is a windbreaker material and the cotton part is pretty thick so it's warmer than it looks. I love the color combination - very unique!","27-Mar-2020"

I got so many compliments. I would have bought if it wasn’t so expensive. Only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is because the pockets don’t really hold anything. They’re angled so that stuff falls out easily, which sucks because I think they could have made really functional pockets, or a pocket on the inside, that would have still been super cute.","11-Mar-2020"

This was the perfect colorful piece to POP my fall wardrobe for a bit. It is slightly oversized, but cropped at the same time. So cute worn open over a dress. The nobbled shearling fabric was cosy, and the floral patches felt like luxe silk linen. Its fully lined with nylon so good during windy days too. I loved the neon touches....still sad I had to give it back to Nuuly.","30-Nov-2019"

It's incredibly warm and so comfortable. I generally wore it with jeans or leggings and either a simple white/black top or a graphic tee. It's definitely hard to pair with more detailed or complex shirts since it's already doing a lot on its own but it was the perfect addition to a lazy-day work outfit.

Put it on, zipped it up, and realized that 75% of my boobs were out. This dress was the length of a midi in the style of a prairie dress, which I think if I frequented more saloons, might have been more appropriate.
