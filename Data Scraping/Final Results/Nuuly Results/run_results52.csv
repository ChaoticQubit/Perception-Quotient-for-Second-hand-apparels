"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","Yany","Runs small","I decided to order a medium because of a review I read, but I wish I would have ordered an XL. The medium fits, but is snug and not loose fitting or flattering. Also, it’s short. Cute top, but sizing just didn’t work ☹️.","15-May-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","AnneMarie","Great with Jeans","I love this blouse with jeans. It is soft cotton, short sleeve and comfortable.","10-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","natty","Great casual top","This was just so simple to throw on with some high waisted jeans and tennis shoes. The neckline was the perfect depth. Just a great look for a casual day or errands or whatever.","25-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","Racheldwise","Love the shirt but petite is very cropped","I liked the style of this shirt, but the petite was so cropped on me! I have a very short waist and it was still too cropped. Maybe the regular sizes would be a little better!","5-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","CuteCalmCactus","Cute and comfy","Love this shirt! Such an easy top to throw on. It is a slouchy loose shirt TTS. You could size down if you wanted but I was happy with my normal size. It is slightly sheer but a nude bra works great.","4-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","Trayment","Boxy","Was a bit wrinkly so I didn’t end up wearing. Also pretty boxy. Wanted to love but didn’t","4-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","alliew","Cute Shirt!","A TINY bit tight on the chest if you're a little bit busty, but if you don't have boobs - this shirt is adorable. I got loads of compliments on it throughout the night!","18-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","Goodjuju","Not flattering","Didn’t end up wearing it after trying it on. The fit was not flattering on my body.","6-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","Abbey","Long torso? Just say no.","The photo is a little deceiving--this was WAY short. Considering how billowy it is, I was hoping I could tuck it in at the front, but it's too short to do that. Quality seemed fine.","31-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","emmyfromtheblock","A little boxy, but cute","Had a hard time making this top work for me. Pretty boxy in the shoulders, and just never fit right.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","Fionabenhur","Perfect casual blouse","Great material that is light but not see through. Deep v neck and good sleeve length. Perfect length in petite size for me as I’m short waisted and it hit low hip but not too long. Boxy fit but still flattering. Loved it!","29-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","jstreet","Easy Basic!","This top was super easy & comfortable to wear! Great option for work or to wear on the weekend. It definitely fits baggy and I decided to wear a camisole underneath because it was somewhat low cut.","26-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","ghartwig19","Great top for work","I got to wear this top a few times over the course of the month. This top definitely runs larger and could become pretty low cut over the course of the day, so I would have to keep adjusting it, but it's definitely a great top for work! Super comfortable and breathable fabric as well.","6-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/amira-utility-blouse?color=066","G-","Amira Utility Blouse","Great top. I got a lot of compliments on this one. Perfect for summer - loved the light material. Not too low cut so I could wear to work but also light and flowy and great w jeans or jean shorts.","24-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nia-tunic?color=061","Beachkat","Cute top","Wore the XXSP and it was great. Snug on the top but I left the buttons open anyway. I think if I had ordered an XS regular I probably could’ve pulled it off as a dress. But the petit length was fun over shorts. I’m 33-26-33","21-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nia-tunic?color=061","JLS333","Cute & Easy!","This tunic is so cute and easy to wear with leggings. I am going to purchase it as I don't think I can live without it!","20-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nia-tunic?color=061","Hez","Cute, just a little too frilly for me.","This is a nice piece, just not for me. Wore a striped Breton top underneath it and that looked cute, though.","15-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nia-tunic?color=061","Al","Pretty tunic top","Love the colors and print of this tunic. It is very loose and flowy, I could have sized down but it looked cute on despite it being roomy. Very comfortable and a good choice if you want to try out the tunic style.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/nia-tunic?color=061","Susan","Pretty tunic","Lovey top with gauzy fabric, great for a summer day. A bit loose on me but I still very much enjoyed wearing it.","28-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","sg123","Great Quality but Way Too Large","I really liked this piece. It was formal but definitely trendy. I got an XS thinking it might be too tight (I'm usually a XS/S in most brands), but it ended up just being overall way too large everywhere when I tried it on so I was never able to wear it. So, if you are not an XS and can size down I would recommend.","8-Apr-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","EmK17","Use a safety pin!","Super cute and a great material, but it’s very loose in the front and would have worked so much better if I could safety pin it.","13-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","Lauragray10","Super cute—needs an undershirt","I had planned on wearing this with a bralette but it really needs a full undershirt. But super cute and good w/jeans for a casual night out.","1-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","Awm","Cute but a little ill fitting","Similar to what other people said. This is good for under a jacket because the print is cute. Stand alone it was too big in the chest and the cinching was in the wrong place for a good fit.","3-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","Tastes57","Not my style","Style just wasn't for me. Elastic in waist sat at an awkward spot for me, making me look heavier.","22-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","LaurenG","Pretty & Comfortable","This top is very cute but I think it’s made for a shorter torso, the middle seam hit me in a weird spot.","20-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","sthompson1792","Cute top, didn't love the metallic","This top was just okay. Nothing special. I loved the cut of it but the metallic threads made it look a little cheap so I never ended up wearing it.","13-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","MargotSullivan","Cut not flattering","Didn't work for me. too short waisted and open in front but fabric was pretty and could work with a tanktop under","5-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","Faye","Close","It was very cute! But I have a smaller chest and it was too loose. I would have had to tape it down to wear it out. Although would have shown great cleavage.","31-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","Abbey","Good quality, but low cut","As someone with a larger chest for my frame, I thought this would work. It was very loose in the bust--too much fabric all around.","31-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/dionne-metallic-floral-blouse?color=009","AnnaK","Cute top","Liked this top but didn’t love it. It has some shiny, silvery streaks in it that I thought made it look either cheap or too clubby. I don’t know which one. It also had a very very deep V in the neck. The material is thin and so a pin was super obvious. I did have to pin it to feel ok wearing it but I was annoyed at the pulling of the material by the pin all day.","23-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/letty-relaxed-moto-parka?color=061","MollH","Super baggy but meant to be","I didn’t like the jacket at first because it seemed too oversized, but ended up wearing it and got so many compliments on the color! Ended up loving that it was baggy - wore to work as a jacket, on weekends with a tee/leggings, and with a sweater and jeans too. I Only wore it open and not zipped though - while most of the jacket was baggy, the bottom of the jacket was tight on my hips when zipped (I’m a pear shape).","11-Mar-2020"

Unfortunately it’s a little too thick for Miami weather so I didn’t get to wear it as much but I absolutely loved the color and material. Great oversized jacket, easy to style.","23-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/letty-relaxed-moto-parka?color=061","Pear","Hangs like a misshapen bag","This one didn't work for me. I think the size was right, but it fit like a misshapen canvas bag. Ironing it might have helped a tiny bit, but not enough that I'd want to wear it. The material is thick, so it probably would provide some warmth. The color is very pretty.","19-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/letty-relaxed-moto-parka?color=061","CStgelais","Great jacket but not great for big hips","Being in Florida I wanted a jacket that wasn’t too heavy and this worked perfect!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/letty-relaxed-moto-parka?color=061","LauraE","Versatile jacket!","Loved this jacket! The color was complimentary to the rest of my wardrobe. It fit perfectly too. The weight of the jacket was just right for a Scottsdale , AZ winter!","12-Dec-2019"

I honestly debated keeping them, but they were a little too cropped (and I'm pretty short at 5ft 1').

They are super baggy and unflattering in the button fly area so that is why they only get 3 stars.

I paired them with a white crop top and flip flops, a low cut body suit and strappy sandals, and a graphic tee and sneakers. The only thing - SIZE WAY DOWN. I chose a S and by the 4th wear I needed to pin the waistband to keep them from falling off. I'm going to rent these again in the XS next month and purchase because I simply can't live without them. Highly recommend.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The rise is quite high and the length brushes the floor with my 5'3"" height. I was able to roll them down once and wear a longer top to wear them once, but didn't quite attain the adorable ""high water"" look that the model has, as they were still quite long and you couldn't really get the effect of the cute hem.

I am usually a medium to large in bottoms and the small was perfect. I'm tall, so I wore them high waisted as a cropped pant.

It was a little on the shorter side even with how short I am so just be careful bending down/over for anything.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/front-pockets-mini?color=066","Mika","Love the material","The material is so soft. It’s a heavier weighted fabric which makes it looks dressier and helps it hang well.

In fact, it's super soft and comfy! I loved the modern feel of the style and paired it with some chunky accessories to give it a bit more dimension from the front, since the back has the only pop of patterned detail with the cheetah print tie. To me it runs perfectly true to size - it's meant to be a boxy fit! I'm also 5'8"" and didn't find it short like other reviews mentioned, but I sit at a desk and don't do too much bending during the day, so if you're a bit more active in your day beware I suppose!

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/front-pockets-mini?color=001","Kittyqueen","Awkward fit","The fit is awkward. There isnt any ease in the bust which causes puckering on the sides of the bust area.

It was a little on the shorter side even with how short I am so just be careful bending down/over for anything.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/front-pockets-mini?color=001","Mika","Love the material","The material is so soft. It’s a heavier weighted fabric which makes it looks dressier and helps it hang well.

In fact, it's super soft and comfy! I loved the modern feel of the style and paired it with some chunky accessories to give it a bit more dimension from the front, since the back has the only pop of patterned detail with the cheetah print tie. To me it runs perfectly true to size - it's meant to be a boxy fit! I'm also 5'8"" and didn't find it short like other reviews mentioned, but I sit at a desk and don't do too much bending during the day, so if you're a bit more active in your day beware I suppose!

I got a million compliments when I wore it running errands the other day. My only qualm is the sleeve length is a bit too long for my liking, but not not too bothersome. I feel like it fit a little large for a small, the shoulders and arm holes definitely had sufficient room (I’m usually between a small & medium) and there was ample space for me inside the shirt.","20-Sep-2019"

However, I found that it ran a bit big on me and I felt it didn't look as polished as I would like it to. I wore this tucked in and planned to wear this to work, but felt it was too big across my shoulders and stomach. I think this would look cute under a denim jacket (I got the Levi's Fringe Attitude jacket and love it!), but it's still too hot for a long-sleeved blouse under a jacket. The jacket would've helped to slim the shoulders a bit!","13-Aug-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/peek-a-boo-bow-blouse?color=010","Nik","Glad it was only temporary","This blouse was just okay. The material was pretty cheap and the fit was a little weird. The peek-a-boo detail makes it a little difficult to keep your bra from showing in a weird way. I was able to wear it twice, but each time, I was worried about my boobs showing and that’s not my style. I felt more self-conscious than comfortable in this.","25-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/peek-a-boo-bow-blouse?color=010","kgmf_500","Looks good on image, but cheap material and runs big","I haven't worn this brand (Endless Rose) before but based on item received not sure I would choose this brand again. The top is cute for an Instagram pic but IRL the material seems / feels cheap and wrinkles easily. It also has a subtle lined patterned whereas here it looks like it is plain white. Also the picture makes the top seem more structured than it is - thought it would cinch in a bit at the waste and hold me and then puff out again into a peplum but instead it feels more like a t-shirt. Which is fine, if that's what you want go for it. Again, it's cute enough but just wasn't what I was expecting. Never wore other than to try on because it looked oversized on me (particularly around the bust).","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The silhouette is not one that is easy to find today but can certainly be pulled off. I wear a 32C bra for reference and the bust was definitely tight.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/vintage-80s-denim-overalls?color=091","BisForBridget","Very Long and Oversized","I wish I could have worn these overalls, but they were far too long on me (5'9). The item is definitely oversized which made the inseam when I had them start a few inches lower than a regular fitted pair of pants which made them very long on. Adding a heel or platform wouldn't have worked for me and I found that cuffing the denim wasn't a look I liked. It's a heavier weight denim, but it's not very rigid, so it felt a bit sloppy while double cuffed. But, here are the measurements to help you make the decision on if it's the right fit for you! 64"" - Total Length from Top of Strap to Bottom 9"" - Top of Strap to Top of Bib 32"" - Inseam 10"" - Leg Opening","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I ended up just wearing it on the printed side, but that being said I really liked it & wore it quite a few times! It’s made a bit oversized & boxy, but that’s what I liked.

The only difference from the picture I would say is that the model is likely pretty tall (duh) and the jacket probably comes down a little lower on most people. Not too low, just pointing out that it hit a little lower than appears on model. I wore it both zipped and unzipped. All around, great item and I considered buying it.","15-Mar-2020"

I outfitted it with girly pieces and it was a nice punch and with a hoodie for a little more urban look so its very versatile.

Sad it didn't come with the hood, but I think that was a slip up and most people get the hood. Either way, I loved the style. It fit like a glove, although kind of tight in the arms so it didn't work with puffy sleeved shirts underneath. This may not be a problem for you though as I kinda size down and wear my tops and jackets really tight.","18-Jan-2020"

The material I'd buttery soft, not at all plasticky, the hood is a great addition, and it just looks cool, without being too over the top. I'm 5'3 and its perfect on my torso, but I could see it being much more of a cropped fit on a tall person.","21-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/spruce-military-shirt-jacket?color=031","Lexluna","Perfect Lightweight Layer","I wore this jacket so much that I ended up renting it two months in a row! First time I ordered it, I got a Large (I am normally a size 10/12) - it was oversized but I was not drowning in it. It was the perfect weight for Sept/October in NYC.. the next time I ordered I sized down to a Medium which still had an oversized vibe to it. I received a lot of compliments on this jacket because it looks really authentic. The paint splatter details and patchwork flag make it feel more special than a typical military style jacket.","4-Nov-2019"

The material is on the heavy side, but I absolutely loved the colors and how easy it was to pair multiple ways.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/feeling-groovy-midi-dress?color=060","lavitacarlita","not a fan -- didn't wear","I really wanted to love this dress, and the feel and print of the fabric are actually really nice, but the fit is wacky! it was HUGE even when I sized down more than a full size, and there just wasn't anything cute I could figure out to do with the extra bulk that looked right. belting it was a slight improvement, but because the sizing is so very generous, even that left some unsightly bulging that added a lot of weight to my frame that looked frumpy instead of cute. and because the sleeves are so voluminous, trying to put on a structured jacket or sweater on top to tone down the volume of the dress itself wasn't even feasible. alas, I tried it on once, tried in sincerity to experiment with how I might wear it, but never did because I felt like I was swimming in it.","25-Nov-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/feeling-groovy-midi-dress?color=060","crystal_visions","Pretty and feminine, with so many different ways to make it your own.","Like many of the Free People styles, this runs a bit oversized. I'm typically a size Medium in most brands, but I rented a Small in this dress. TBH, I could have probably opted for an XS. But let's not get ahead of ourselves! When I first put it on, I wasn't very impressed. It was a little too much fabric for me. But then I cinched it in with a concho belt. It looked so good! The waist definition drew attention to the great dolman sleeves. I also did not use the slip that accompanied it because it hit me above the neckline of the dress. Instead I wore it with a bralette and nude bike shorts. It's barely sheer, so this worked and was not too risque for work. I am definitely going to rent it in the second color next month. I am taking off one star because the fabric was very unbreathable and I smelled a little ripe by the end of the day.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I'm typically a size Medium in most brands, but I rented a Small in this dress. TBH, I could have probably opted for an XS. But let's not get ahead of ourselves! When I first put it on, I wasn't very impressed. It was a little too much fabric for me. But then I cinched it in with a concho belt. It looked so good! The waist definition drew attention to the great dolman sleeves. I also did not use the slip that accompanied it because it hit me above the neckline of the dress. Instead I wore it with a bralette and nude bike shorts. It's barely sheer, so this worked and was not too risque for work. I am definitely going to rent it in the second color next month. I am taking off one star because the fabric was very unbreathable and I smelled a little ripe by the end of the day.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It's an absolutely gorgeous cardigan, though - I paired it with jeans and a simple back tee and got compliments all day! The photos don't do it justice; there are so many beautiful colors and details in the knit that you only notice up-close. I won't be keeping it, but it is so much fun to wear for the month.","5-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","pbrooklyn","Too short to for a dress, too long for a tunic","I liked this piece in theory, but was a little confused by the length. Ideal as a beach cover up length, but not really to wear about town. I don't really have a huge torso and I didn't run into the shortening problem as with most dresses when you have a large bum. It was plenty roomy it was just an awkward length. As a result I often wore this as a layered tunic with a mock neck under. It worked but wasn't quite the right length for that either. It's a cute piece but very heavy and a lot of fabric and ultimately just a bit too fussy for me.","20-Nov-2019"

I normally would be a medium but I took the other reviewers' advice and sized down which was definitely the move. I would have been swimming in a medium but the small hung just right and was perfect for work into a night out.","25-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","funkybanana","Size down!!!","Liked the style, but I suggest sizing down a size or two - ran very, very large! It's the style dress that I'd rather wear smaller than larger anyways (since the style is meant to be loose), so definitely reco sizing down.","25-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","ef1090","Beautiful!","This dress is beautiful and the fit is perfect. It runs a little big, but I like the oversized look and it wasn't unflattering. It's thick material and I can see it being scratchy to some people, but it didn't bother me. Wish I could've bought this one!","22-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","tyler","Knew I should have sized down TWICE","I have other free people dresses that are a lose fit and in a small... but I just knew I should have ordered an XS in this. The most important measurement to consider when ordering this dress is height. If you're 5'5 you must order and EXTRA SMALL I had to pin up the sleeves of the small to make it the right length in arms and hit at the right place on my leg.","21-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","k8collins","Huge","Just like all the other reviews, this dress was a no go for me because of all the extra fabric. I think it has the opportunity to be styled a certain way if that's what you're looking for - but for me I could never get it just right.","21-Oct-2019"

I read other reviews and decided to size down and really glad I did. The dress was really flowy and the XS fit perfectly. Also beware the v neckline is really low. I’m small chested so it wasn’t an issue for me.","8-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","hilary","SO CUTE","Definitely has an oversized, boho fit. And the length was perfect for me, even being on the taller end! You may need to play around with different undergarments to find what works! I tried doing a strapless bra and found myself pulling at the neckline to keep it from showing - may have worked better to wear like a lace bralette or something similar!","6-Oct-2019"

I wore this dress every chance I could. To work, to dinner, to a blogger event, to brunch, seriously everywhere. It definitely has an oversize fit, which I liked, but you can add a belt to give it a little more shape. I also paired with a wide brim felt hat and actually got stopped in the mall so someone could tell me how fabulous I looked.","16-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","beccamathias","Too large / uncomfortable material","I loved the overall look of it - but it did not fit me well at all. I would need an XXS for this to fit me properly. The material is a bit scratchy and stiff.","10-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","CaraCara","Romantic","This dress was very flowy, romantic, and hung nicely on me. However, it was a bit larger than I wanted it to be which made it feel a little baggy. Wore it to work, although I had been planning to wear it on a date. Thought the fabric would be a little lighter, which made it too heavy for a summer date night.","24-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","puma9lg","Made me feel pretty","This dress made me feel pretty, and was super comfy, BUT it does feel like it runs large. The cut is pretty low so if you are comfortable with cleavage than you should be fine, but in the future I might size down to see if that's a better fit for me.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","midas","LOVE","I absolutely adore this dress! It is heavy enough where I am not cold, but light enough that I can wear it in an Alabama summer and not be too hot. Absolutely love this dress!","19-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","Mich89","love, love, love!","Seriously, love! If you haven't rented this dress yet, what are you waiting for? If you're like me and like to put in minimum effort for maximum results (at least when it comes to getting dressed in the morning) this dress is for you! Throw it on, and go - it's that easy. I wore it with a pair of nude espadrille wedges and got so many compliments. It is a little longer than it looks in the picture, I'm 5'7 and it just skims my knees. The sleeves are a little on the longer side as well. I would recommend sizing down, and renting in every color. :)","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

It is a loose fitting dress naturally too so keep that in mind! It will not give you any shape at all but it is beautiful nonetheless.","13-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/cant-help-it-mini-dress?color=001","thenuukid","Super fun color!","This dress was the perfect example of rental helping me step out of my comfort zone! I decided to rent it on a whim since it's not exactly what I'd call my ~style~ and I don't own a single thing in red. I got SO many compliments, before I even got to work the barista at my coffee shop told me it was a great color on me! Now I know I should try wearing red more! It's true to size for a shift style dress - I probably could have sized down to the XS without much changing in the way of fit or length, but the S still worked perfectly. Definitely recommend for a bold pop of color in your monthly rotation!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
