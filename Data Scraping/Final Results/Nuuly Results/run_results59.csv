"https://www.nuuly.com/products/asymmetrical-boho-maxi?color=014","JustMel","Very cute but small in the waist","I had hoped this would work but it didn’t. That said, it was super cute and I may try it in a medium.","26-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/asymmetrical-boho-maxi?color=014","edaleeta","Great skirt for a warm vacation","The pattern and cut of this skirt is gorgeous! It sits quite high-waisted on me, but I liked that. Though I liked where it fit, I think it runs on the small side - it was definitely snug, and didn't leave too much wiggle room; the waist isn't stretchy at all. My friends thought I should keep this one!","23-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/asymmetrical-boho-maxi?color=014","KellyMarie","Adorable","This skirt was too cute. If I was to rent it again I would rent a Small instead of an X Small. The skirt fit and I was able to wear it on my vacation but there was no give at all in the waste line which made it tight when sitting.","27-Jan-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/asymmetrical-boho-maxi?color=014","Aaryn2009","Unforgiving waist","Love this skirt but wish I had sized up. No elastic in the waist and it’s very tight. Too much so to be wearable. The rest of the skirt fit perfect through the hips though. If only the waist had some give to it, it would be perfect. Super cute otherwise!","20-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/asymmetrical-boho-maxi?color=014","lifeisgood","Cute but waist is small","Cute skirt. I ordered it a size (or 2) too small. It was tight in the waist. But I would have loved wearing it if it had fit.","11-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/asymmetrical-boho-maxi?color=014","MegGal","Boho Beautiful!","I love this skirt! It is cut just right- easy to walk in and flowy- felt so pretty! I wore it to a family party but also wore it just to walk around town.","16-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/asymmetrical-boho-maxi?color=014","SarahC","Wanted to love, but too big","The pattern of this skirt is beautiful, but I read the other reviews saying to size up and unfortunately found the waist entirely too large to wear. I am a true size S and went with a M which caused the waist of the skirt to drop around my hips. I prefer a high-waisted fit, so with the skirt being over sized on me, it just wasn't flattering.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/asymmetrical-boho-maxi?color=014","chelseasays","Fun & Flowy","The skirt was very pretty and lightweight - perfect for summer! That being said, I like wearing skirts higher up on my waist so this ended up being a bit too loose for me, unfortunately. I did feel though that if I sized down, it would have been too tight so this isn't ideal if you're someone who can fall in between sizes. As far as styling goes, I paired it with a black bodysuit and wedges when trying it on (exactly how the model is styled) and it worked perfectly.","24-Jul-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/asymmetrical-boho-maxi?color=014","amanda","waist is tight","This is a lovely skirt, but I would suggest to either size up, or order it in 2 sizes to be sure.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/asymmetrical-boho-maxi?color=014","NatalieH","Cute Skirt, Size Up!","The fabric and texture of this skirt is perfect - such a great quality! That said, the waist is SUPER snug. Be sure to size up one size (maybe even 2 sizes) for a good fit. I have a fairly small waist and couldn't even zip the zipper up. I will definitely be trying again in a bigger size though, because it is superbly comfortable for the hot summer days we are experiencing.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/orchid-embroidered-blouse?color=011","emilyd","Love it","Wore this for Lunar New Year and it was perfect. Colors of the embroidery really pop.","28-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/orchid-embroidered-blouse?color=011","Chandler","Lovely (just hide the tassels)","I loved the details on this top! There are little sequins in the embroidery that you can’t really see in the photos, and they make it even more special. The tassels were really frayed and messy when it arrived and I couldn’t make them look nice so I just tucked them into the shirt and kept them hidden. Not a big deal though. Overall a lovely shirt!","18-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/orchid-embroidered-blouse?color=011","AshleyG","Love! Super beautiful, and tons of compliments","I loved getting to wear this top! I styled it with overalls, jeans, and and tucked into a skirt. I was worried the white would be see-though, but it was just thick enough to not show my bra. I did notice that the tassels like to unravel, so I was worried they may fray too much and lose all their pink string. I kept re-winding up the string so it wouldn't completely unravel. This probably doesn't happen on all of them, as it only happened to one of the pink tassels on mine.","14-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/orchid-embroidered-blouse?color=011","annievk","So cute, but soo small","I am normally an xs and normally do not size up as sometimes even an xs is too big. This blouse is SO cute, but was SO small! I should of gone up to a small or honestly, possibly a medium.","30-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/orchid-embroidered-blouse?color=011","CA2","TTS and super cute!","LOVED this top! Fit true to size. Might be tight across the chest for someone with a larger chest. Beautiful details!","30-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/orchid-embroidered-blouse?color=011","SallyBrown","So pretty, but runs small","This top has such pretty details from the embroidery and the sequin touches, but it runs tiny! I can usually wear XS or S in most brands, but I could barely get the XS on- it was tight across the chest, shoulders, and armpits. I don't know if a small would have fit either. If you are between 2 sizes, definitely choose the bigger one!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/orchid-embroidered-blouse?color=011","Jhall","Light and breezy!","This shirt was really cute and so comfortable! I am giving it a 4 star rating because the tassels unraveled during the first hour of wearing it. It was the perfect material for a hot day. It also matches a lot so you can mix up wearing it with jeans or shorts!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mountain-trail-tunic?color=010","Hanniekins","so much fabric","I should have listened to the other reviews... there is way too much fabric on this. It ""fits"" in the places a flowy top should fit - arm holes, neckline, even length bc it's a tunic. But it just has so much fabric it feels silly. It would be a super cute summer maternity top. It's well made and good quality fabric, but just a lot of it","31-Mar-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mountain-trail-tunic?color=010","msr0129","Beautiful and flowy","I was only able to wear this once due to the colder weather. I paired it with a denim jacket and received a ton of compliments. It is long and flowy, so if you are petite you may not like it. Perfect for pregnancy and I wish I was able to wear it more but the weather didn't cooperate.","20-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mountain-trail-tunic?color=010","chrissyd","sleeveless tunic for summer only","very boho but really couldn't wear it in cold weather. would be great for summer with shorts or lightweight pants. very oversized could have worn an xxs","13-Feb-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mountain-trail-tunic?color=010","Lacasta","Too much fabric.","It reminded me of a piece of maturity wear. I tend to stay away from pieces like this that have too much fabric. Its not represented well on the model, who makes it look like a slim and chic tunic.","21-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mountain-trail-tunic?color=010","lcastromckee","Most comfortable tunic and gorgeous details, runs large","I was searching for tunic-style tops I could wear over maternity jeans and this was the perfect one. I wore my normal pre-pregnancy size (XS) at 22-26 weeks pregnant and while still a little hangy on top, it was the perfect length. The crochet details are beautiful on this. I would wear over and over again without my bump, but I would like need a petite size or XXS. Pre-pregnancy I was 5’4 108 lbs and am closer to 130 with a bump in the photo.","17-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mountain-trail-tunic?color=010","Diary_of_a_fit_mama","Too much flare for me","I love all the detail of this lacey top. My only complaints are that I should've sized down more than one size and the flare at the bottom of the top is a little too much for my hips!","15-Oct-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mountain-trail-tunic?color=010","SchnipSchnap","Easy Breezy Tunic","I decided to stick with my normal size Large even though some reviews said it ran large. While there was a lot of fabric, it's lightweight so it flowed fine. It is very sheer, so if you aren't comfortable with that, you may want to wear a cami underneath. I wore this with skinny fit pants and looked very cute with it!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mountain-trail-tunic?color=010","emmyfromtheblock","Beautiful, Flowy Tank with Killer Details","LOVED this top! Rented while 9 months pregnant, and it checked every box - covered the bump (with plenty of fabric to spare), had beautiful detailing, and an excellent drape. The weight of the fabric also gave it a lovely movement, with a great swing for end of summer. Love, love, love!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mountain-trail-tunic?color=010","ashleyk","Cute, versatile, easy top","There's so much to love about this tunic! It's lightweight (so when it's 90+ degrees outside you feel cute AND cool), the detailing is beautiful and it goes with everything! I will note that it is pretty sheer as you can tell by the photo, I personally didn't have an issue with it but it is something to note. Also, I probably could have sized down to an XS rather than the S I rented - I'm in between sizes and since there's so much fabric on the sides to enhance the flowy-ness, it does end up being a lot. If you're looking for a true tunic that you can wear day or night, this is the one for you.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meet-in-capri-maxi?color=049","Latane54","Cute In Theory But Not Practical","I so wanted to love this dress but it was just weird. The way that the bust fits makes it feel like you're going to pop out at any minute but there is no way to wear a bra or cami or anything under it without it showing and looking absurd. Even if you were to make use of some dress tape to secure the girls, the fabric is so thin that there is nothing left to the imagination. So basically, in order to make it decent you need pasties and dress tape and I personally feel like that's too much work for a fun vacation dress.","16-Dec-2019"

It hung lower on my chest than I expected, but you still get the cute off-the-shoulder style without the worry because the spaghetti straps keep it locked in place. 10/10","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meet-in-capri-maxi?color=049","Rachel","Fun, Flirty Dress!","This dress is awesome! So fun to move around in, and would be perfect to wear for an occasion where dancing was involved. Given my build, I was fine with the bust area and the straps, but if you are broad shoulders or have a large bust I would consider sizing up or avoiding this style. So pretty!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meet-in-capri-maxi?color=049","CA","Gorgeous but didn't work for me!","I thought this dress was so beautiful, but the neckline just didn't work for me. The straps were too wide for my shoulders (so were falling off), and the neckline was too low. You can't wear a normal bra with this. For the right body type though, this would be stunning!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

Super versatile and lovely piece!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meet-in-capri-maxi?color=049","krc314","Tight bust and shoulders","Such a beautiful style of dress. The model makes it look gorgeous, however, in person it looks like a small tablecloth. I'm usually a small or medium in dresses. I went with a small, and while it fit my waist fine, my bust/chest was squeezed so tightly. The cut is very unflattering on chests. It's a shame I can't wear it this month.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/meet-in-capri-maxi?color=049","Patrizia1441","Did not Work","Unfortunately this ran small and it did not fit me so I could not wear it all month :( In its defense, I am between an XS and a S so I went for the smaller when I probably should have gone bigger to be safe. A bummer because it is quite pretty!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mini-skirt-maximum-sequin?color=000","termimaeter","Cute but not flattering","I wore this to a birthday party and although the skirt itself is cute, the waistband is weirdly elastic and just not flattering. It didn’t sit right so whether I wore a shirt tucked or untucked it just hid my waistline that’s usually more hourglass.","18-Mar-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mini-skirt-maximum-sequin?color=000","linzz","Needs leggings","I got this for new years and it was perfect. I am very tall, and this skirt would not work without opaque tights. Needs an underlayer because it's short. Gapped a little in back above butt, but it winter and I had a jacket.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mini-skirt-maximum-sequin?color=000","kmhberlin","Eye-catching","This is one of those skirts you can dress up or down.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mini-skirt-maximum-sequin?color=000","Anoelle","I wanted to like this item","I was so optimistic about this skirt, and loved all the colors! Unfortunately, this item just fit extremely weird. It bunched at the waist, making the sequins poke out. This made the skirt have a very unflattering affect in my mid section.","9-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mini-skirt-maximum-sequin?color=000","jer","Cheaply made & cheap look","The sequence was very messy and the skirt was made of stretchy material that you would have gotten at Limited Too in fourth grade.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mini-skirt-maximum-sequin?color=000","Cvh","Great material, bad fit","Should have gone with the tee-shirt dress that comes in this material! The material is great, but the skirt itself just isn't shaped the way a good mini should be. Because of the way the fabric is sewn into the waistband, it adds a lot of bulk and makes me look like I've got a pooch. It's fine with a big baggy sweater over it, but if you're looking to tuck anything into it, keep looking. Additionally, the back panel of the skirt doesn't have any shape or extra room built into it for a butt, so it rides up a LOT.","13-Dec-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mini-skirt-maximum-sequin?color=000","Beachkat","Too big","love The skirt but it was too big and long. I tried pulling it up, folding it over, it either wrinkled up or looked a mess lol. Runs large at the hips and length imo.","29-Oct-2019"

Wore it to a rehearsal dinner for a Florida wedding and then a few times for a trip to Puerto Rico. Didn’t wear a bra but you might be able to use a strapless bra. I have a narrow torso so it fit me built I could see anyone with a wider torso having a hard time zipping it. I loved it tho and got lots of compliments. The colors are bright and fun and the front part sort of moves around which I didn’t realize from the pictures.","6-Feb-2020"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mixed-print-one-shoulder-maxi-dress?color=069","alpalchi","beautiful, odd fit","I'm typically a large, but sized up to an XL to be safe. unforutunately it was way too loose around the bust - no security for the girls. Fit okay in the waist. I'd recommend going with your exact size, as this is probably pretty true to size. Waist is structured with a zipper but there's some elastic on the side without the zipper and around the bust part.","15-Sep-2019"

If you're an hourglass with a shorter waist, it will puff up the hips and sit poorly. Also, better to be less-busty if you want to wear this piece.","5-Sep-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/mixed-print-one-shoulder-maxi-dress?color=069","NatalieH","Lovely material, just not quite right","I loved this dress in theory but it just didn't work for me. Being super flat chested, I was swimming in the bust area. The cut-out on the side looked much larger on me than in the photo (I'm 5'1, so I'm thinking the length of my waist had something to do with that). With that, there was just way too much material on top to work and be able to wear a bra with. I'll sadly send this back with no wears, but it will definitely look lovely on someone with the right proportions!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I wore it to a sustainability conference in New York on one of the hottest days in July, during rolling blackouts, requiring lots of running between Javits and Penn Station. This dress performed in all ways. The bow stayed tied, i stayed cool, it didn't wrinkle, sweat didn't show...it was brilliant. It fit as expected, and didn't overwhelm in size. The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the dress does NOT want to stay as an off the shoulder. It absolutely refused to be off shoulder, and within 1 min of pulling down, rode back up over the shoulder and became a peasant top. It still looked great, just wasn't off the shoulder.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

The length was just right. Not too long, not too short. The color is a really nice deep blue and the fraying isn't too much, so it felt appropriate for multiple occasions. I also loved the detail of the fraying on the pockets. I took my true size in this, and am totally happy with it. You can't go wrong!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

If you were to be any shorter I would recommend getting a smaller size.

I remember seeing it on the site and going back to it, even though I have a ton of crewnecks and sweatshirts that I own personally. I was very happy that I decided to go with it as it is the PERFECT crewneck for spring/summer. It is super comfy and light-weight and the perfect length for a 'crop' look. I found myself wearing this crewneck as a daily outfit with high-waisted light-wash jeans, over-top of my sports bra when going to work-out class, or to lounge during movie nights with friends. I typically go with a Medium in tops, but decided to go with the Small, which ended up fitting perfectly and giving me the cropped look I was going for, without revealing my stomach at all.

The sleeves were super flattering, I didn't love the bottom though.

I usually go between and M and L and chose a medium in this. I feel like the L would have been too big everywhere else, but I would have liked it on my hips more.

I wish I had ordered a couple of Maeve items in !X instead of 2X. But in the end, I am happy to discover that Maeve is true to size (like Modcloth), which makes future selections MUCH easier.

The only downside is that the arm holes are cut a little large.

It swallowed me. I also didn't realize the buttons were held on with a stark blue thread, which seems like a small detail but made a big difference in terms of how I thought I could wear it. Cute color, though, and would definitely work for people going for a more casual jacket.","10-Dec-2019"

It fit like a glove - I definitely would not have gone any smaller. From the pictures, I thought it would be more of a sundress but it's actually heavier and somewhat structured, with a lining underneath. Wasn't a deterrent for me but definitely made it feel a little more elevated than a standard sundress.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/floral-silk-jacket?color=067","Sierra","Not what I expected","I was hoping for a silky, feminine light jacket when I ordered this. Although winter is not the right season, I was thinking I could wear it as more of a blazer. It was cute, but the material didn't have that silky feel I was expecting - it was pretty still. Still cute and not overstate; I wore it on Valentine's day to the office and out to dinner. The buttons and zipper were all wrong on this jacket though. They were way to large and clunky for something that should have been delicate. The snap buttons just ruined this for me. Also, I have long arms/wide shoulders and per usual, the arms on this were too short.","22-Feb-2020"

I typically wear a 10 or 12 in jackets and the medium fit perfectly: slightly oversized as bomber jackets are supposed to be. The detailed stitching on this jacket is incredibly gorgeous (see photo). It has both a zipper and snaps. The jacket is heavier than I was expecting, considering it's silk. It's a medium weight and it was too hot where I live to wear it outside on summer evenings. The styling is a bit casual for a work environment, but this jacket is so pretty that I wasn't going to let my time with it go to waste, so I paired it with a navy pencil to wear at work in the A/C. I'd love to rent it again when the weather is a tad cooler.","29-Aug-2019"

You can tell just by the fabric that this is a really well made top, but for me, it hit at a really weird spot. The peplum really accentuated my hips and created a very unflattering look so I was never able to wear this top during my month. I will say though, the strappy strap is adjustable, there is elastic in the off the shoulder strap to allow it to lay (and stay) where you please, and there is a zipper!

The long dangling side tie on the model is actually much much shorter unless your waist is as narrow as hers (since the tie is wrapping around your waist before being tied).

(I am 5'2"" with a small torso and 32A bust). I got the smallest size in XS. The length is perfect, but the bust area was loose and the straps were a bit long on me where they would occasionally fall down during the day. Luckily, I was able to pull off this look by wearing a white t-shirt under it. I also got a lot of compliments on it too so no one must have noticed!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

I would just suggest sizing up if you are on the taller side. I am about 5'6 and a small was too short to bend down in. It was really well made with a breathable material. The buttons are so cute, too!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","Alexis","So cute!","This dress was so cute for my trip to Cuba with all of the colors. I have very small boobs though so the only downside is I was not able to fill it out right in the chest area since it is a tie. I just tied it really tight and hoped for the best! But other than that, super flattering.","8-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","Lalalauren","Beautiful Dress","Beautiful lightweight dress. Wore it to the beach and got many compliments. The bust area is definitely sort of awkward shaped if you have big boobs. Doesn’t allow for a bra.","6-Jan-2020"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","sarahenguessan","Lots of under boob","I got this for my cruise & still wore it despite the under boob. Because it’s a cruise & I felt like under boob was okay. Tried to tighten the top in so many different ways. I have pretty perky boobs, but couldn’t keep them up in this dress. Tried with & with out stick on bra. Bummed bc it fit like a glove everywhere else. The bust tie just needs to be like 2 inches lower & it would be perfect. Where I tied was above my boobs & it should have been under to push them up.","23-Dec-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","Ryleeboland","Terrible fit","the dress was very tight around the stomach but on top was huge and the front ties fell way above my breast, making way too much underboob","13-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","LM27","Want to love this, but the fit is off","I saw this dress and knew I needed to have it for a day event I was hosting. It was so bright and the cut out added just the amount of flare I was looking for. The top is definitely loose, especially for a small chested girl like me, but I did appreciate that the tie and straps were adjustable, this plus a sticky bra made it totally wearable for me. However, the waist was extremely tight, almost suffocating . I spent an entire night wearing it just trying to stretch it out as much as possible, which helped but not as much as I would have liked. There is definitely no need for a dress like this to fit as a second skin especially when the material has absolutely no stretch. This may be my fault for not ordering up, but I was very concerned about the chest situation. Oh well, I still wore it and got lots of compliments!","7-Nov-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","KH","Tricky fit in the chest","Beautiful dress, fit me everywhere except the bust. I ended up still being able to wear it but didn't feel as ""secure"" as I would have liked and ended up showing a little underboob.","9-Oct-2019"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","ladylaw","Ill fitting","This dress is very pretty, but fit me poorly. It was loose on the chest, but tight on the waist, so it was not very flattering.","11-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","LindseyD","Very cute, for smaller chested","Beautiful dress but arrived pretty wrinkled, more wrinkled than the “wrinkle remover” could handle.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","CC","Not for me","I liked this dress even more when I saw it in person - the colors and fabric are really cute and summery. But unfortunately I really struggled with the cut. I could not figure out how to adjust the top enough to comfortably cover myself without worrying about popping out. Also, I liked that the skirt was loose and floaty, but there was too much fabric across the belly and it left the top of the skirt gaping open. Maybe could’ve worked with a small white tee shirt or tank underneath but I didn’t try it.","4-Sep-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","talulasmom","CUTE.","This dress is so cute and flattering. I received many compliments and only wish I had more opportunities to wear it. It definitely runs a big small up top, and was tighter than expected, so go up a size for sure!","28-Aug-2019"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","rebecweitz","Very cute","Loved this dress. Sizing was a bit tight so if you're between sizes go up. Also the top was a bit tricky as I kept worrying I was going to fall out; I didn't, but still, had to muster a bit of courage to wear (for reference I'm a 34A and the top was very loose). Tape helps and made me feel way better about not giving anyone a show they didn't ask to see :)","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

As the review title alludes, every time I wore this dress I received a myriad of compliments. It hugged and curved my body in all the right angles and is just a fun statement dressed.

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","thenuukid","Beautiful, runs small and yet somehow large as well...","This dress was one of the first items on the nuuly website that caught my eye! It's super fun and colorful for summer and just as vibrant in person. The only issue is the sizing. The banded area around my ribcage was suuuper tight to the point that I had to WORK to get the zipper past that point. Maybe I just have a large ribcage? The skirt was flowy and laid nicely but I think sizing up would've made it bunchy. The tie at the top is super roomy to the point that it looked too big for me (again, couldn't size up), but I'm very small chested, so no surprise there. I guess I say give it a try if you really want, because it’s beautiful and so fun, but beware…..","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","BMJ12","Fit & length were perfect!","This fit perfectly! I was concerned that it would be too large in the waist and top, but the waist band was perfectly snug and the tie top is adjustable, so you can tie it as tight as you'd like. The slip underneath the dress is not as long as the actual garment, so I stayed cool in the summer heat! Would definitely wear again.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"
"https://www.nuuly.com/products/rainbow-cut-out-midi?color=000","melissa","Cute but very large","I normally wear a size xs or s depending on the brand, but this was very large on me. I would probably need an xxs, if they had one. Even tying the bow tighter didn't help much, unfortunately, because the waist area gaped significantly. With that said, the dress itself was great in person, just like the photo - I wish it had fit because I would have loved to wear it!","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/striped-maxi-tunic?color=041","SkyP","Cute and comfortable.","I styled over white bermuda shorts, but with the slit being so high you would always have to wear something underneath. Would be cute over jeans or leggings as well.","EMPLOYEE REVIEW"

"https://www.nuuly.com/products/drop-waist-striped-midi?color=041","MaryMchitown","Comfy but not totally flattering","Enjoyed wearing this on a vacation. The fabric is a heavier weight, which felt right for the 75 degree weather. Length was good on me, being a taller person! Only con which other reviewers mentioned is the curved cut and striping around the stomach area emphasizes that part more. Definitely felt myself trying to stand up straighter and suck my gut in! But overall it’s a nice, high-quality farmer.","20-Feb-2020"
