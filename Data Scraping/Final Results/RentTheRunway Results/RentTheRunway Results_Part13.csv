Typically a 6, but ordered an 8 after reading reviews. Fit ok with the added size, but a very slinky material. Overall not flattering","March 26, 2020","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Diane","Has pockets!","Rented for a birthday dinner in Tampa, FL. The week prior the Washington Post reported the weather was going to be so cold to watch out for iguanas falling from trees.. my legs can handle cold better than my upper body so I wore a jean jacket after dinner but before that the long sleeves worked well. Wore with open toe suede booties & I thought it was a really cute romper (except for using the bathroom)!!","January 31, 2020","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Chantal","Adorable romper!","Overall it fit true to size and I loved wearing it; however, the front was a little gappy. Also, the little snap on the front kept popping open. Still loved wearing it!","January 11, 2020","Everyday"

I am extremely bloated in my first trimester, but still felt great in this romper... and sexy again!","July 13, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Lauren","Short but comfy","I have a long torso so I'm always iffy with rompers. I got two sizes up and it worked. It was still super short in the bottom section, so if I was to bend over my butt cheeks would have shown. It's pretty light and sorry so good for the spring and summer.","May 26, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Laura","So cute, but way too big","I was so disappointed to leave for vacation without the romper, but it was just way too big for me. I have a slender, athletic build and had ordered another dress in XS and S. When the S was unavailable at the last minute, I selected this as a backup. Even with my most padded bra, I couldn't make it work. The front actually wasn't the issue, it was a bit baggy but didn't look awful, but the zipper in the back ended up looking like a shark fin (I tried to get a picture of it, but couldn't capture it). I could definitely see myself trying the size 0 to see if that fits better.","February 18, 2019","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Melissa","Adorable, unique romper!","This is super cute! It fit like it was made for me. I am normally a 4 but I got a 6 because rompers tend to be too short through the crotch on me. I wore this for our housewarming party and it was perfect. I love it so much I am buying it.","October 1, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Amanda","Great romper","Super comfortable, needed help unzipping whenever I needed to use the restroom, otherwise, would definitely rent again.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Brandi","GNO is always a good time!","I usually wear an 8 petite but this fit very tight in the bust (i.e. snap popped open if I moved my arms) and honestly it just wasn't flattering at all on me.","August 14, 2018","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Leah","Super fun romper, wore to a concert and out in Nashville.","I only had a size 4, I should have worn a size 6. Here's what you need to know. If you have a long torso, this isn't for you. I have a fairly short torso and the length fit perfectly. I am 5'9"" and this romper was SHORT on me. Also, I'm not pregnant, and you can see in one of the pics I posted that you gotta be careful how you stand. Additionally, the clasp on the chest pops open VERY easily, hence the picture where my ladies are popping out accidentally. I got a ton of compliments on this romper, but size 4 is in the past for me. It doesn't run small, per se, I just should have ordered a 6. Material is silk so there is no give. It's hard to zip up in the back.","August 13, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Kimberly","So effing cute","I got so many compliments. It's something you could dress up or down. The only negative was the clasp to cover the décolletage was weirdly high and kept popping open. I ended up keeping it open. I usually wear a 6-8 and got the 6 and it fit perfectly.","July 31, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","RTR Customer","Lightweight, Fun Summer Romper","I rented this romper for casual Friday work attire, but it is SHORT. Even with tights underneath it, I felt like it wasn't appropriate for a professional environment; however, I tossed a pair of white skinny pants over the shorts, and volia! I had a blouse. I took the pants off later and breezed around town in the romper itself. The fabric is light-weight, so I was cool and comfortable even in the summer heat, but the long sleeves kept me warm in my overly air-conditioned office. Overall, a fun, easy summer piece, just beware if you have long legs (for reference, I'm 5'7"")!","July 20, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Rakiya","Stylist Review","I love this trendy dress by Parker! Running true to size with stretchy fabric, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You can totally wear a standard bra with this romper. At 5’6”, it;s pretty short and fitted but I didn't feel uncomfortable since the garment is so stretchy. The pattern on the romper is pretty chic, and the belt adds some flare making this perfect for a vacation or a Sunday brunch. Pair with nude heels and fun earrings to complete your outfit!","May 18, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Vanessa","Great for AZ Weather","Fits true to size. Material is very thin and lightweight. Ended up wearing a size 2, I'm between 2 and 4 and it fit perfectly. Has to use fashion tape to keep the button from popping open.","May 11, 2018","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Gina","Lightweight and comfy","I'm 5'9"" 160lbs 36DD and normally wear a size 4 jean but a 10-12 in dresses. The 12 was a little large, so I pinned the top and tied the belt a little tighter. It was comfy and fun and i got lots of compliments. Rompers usually dont work for me because im tall with a long torso, but this worked great!","May 10, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Jessica","Not just another vacation dress","Loved the feel of this romper! The sleeves were classy and the print provided an amazing color for our Caribbean cruise without blending into a sea of summer dresses. For me, a definite hourglass, the hips were a little tight but still fit well and comfortably. However I did need about 3 pieces of fashion tape to ensure the neckline stayed in place over my DDD chest. But it was worth it and worked perfectly all night!","March 3, 2018","Vacation"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK248","Leah","Poor fit","Did not end up wearing this. For a size 6, the waist was pretty tight.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FK49","Diana","Beautiful dress for a tropical beach wedding","Loved the cut and color. The high slits on both sides made it great for dancing. The lace-up back made the top very adjustable. I chose to go bra-less since the wedding was in Costa Rica (95° and 100% humidity) but still used fashion tape at the collar bones to keep the neckline in place. Great dress, would totally rent again. It did end up wrinkly by the end of the night, but I have to believe that had more to do with the weather than the dress itself.","July 24, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FK49","Carol","Beautiful, elegant, sexy, BF friendly","Love this dress. The fabric is light, soft and breathable. The drape is good. Slits not too high on legs. It's pretty low cut and probably shows my bra a little. Def shows bra in the back which is low and laced up. I love the style, cut and pattern. Easy to nurse in. Would rent again.","July 18, 2019","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FK49","Lahari","The color and style makes this dress standout in a crowd.","The fit was great, but my only complaint is that it's a bit too low and didn't sit firmly on the top part. I have a bigger chest, so it felt like I had to expose a lot to be able to wear this. Also, it wrinkles very easily and shows. Otherwise, beautiful print, color, and style (ties in back, slits on dress, etc.)","July 8, 2019","True to Size"

However, due to its simple design, I anticipated at a 400+ invite wedding that someone would wear something very similar. I was wrong - simply put: I received so many compliments & nobody wore a color close to this. The vibrancy is truly unique. Only downside was that it was slight too long (even wearing 4"" heels as I am 5'4!) and slightly too big in the bust, so I found myself carrying it whenever I had to walk. I would definitely rent this again, just maybe add some temporary hem tape next time.","August 6, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG133","Jenna","Great color and worked amazing as a maternity dress","At 34 weeks pregnant, it's hard to tell whether it ran true to size. I researched past reviews to decide on sizing up to an 8L (usually a 2-4). The material has a LOT of stretch, which makes it a great maternity option. Also it was very comfortable to both sit and dance in. I am 5'7"" and wore 4"" heels, and the long was almost too long. I think I probably could have gotten away with a regular length. The color was AMAZING and I got a lot of complements on the dress all night. I would definitely rent it again, and might have kept it if it was a size that would fit me post pregnancy.","June 17, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG133","Ally","This is the dress that RTR is good for","The color of this dress was the real standout quality! I say its the reason RTR is worth it bc I would never buy a dress in this color because I couldn't rewear it, so renting is a perfect way to wear something daring like this. The cut was simple and classy and let the color do the talking. The chest fit me well, no slippage but definitely wear a strapless bra with it as the material is a little thin and shows all. The slit is great, the length hit just at the floor with 4 inch heels (I am 5'4) . The only complaint is that the stomach and hips were a little loose and definitely could've been tighter. My backup size was 4 and I didn't even try it on. The 0 could've been a better fit in the stomach but I'm afraid it wouldve been to small for my chest and the back clasp to close, so I stuck with the 2.","May 9, 2019","Large"

The dress was a great length and fabric was very comfortable, but I couldn't go without a bra (D cup). I ended up buying one of those chicken cutlet style stick on bras (invest in a good one!) and that worked well since all my strapless bras either showed through the cutouts or out the top.

The dress I picked after came damaged in both sizes and they sent me a backup that I didn't choose. Customer service was extremely helpful in resolving the issue and to my surprise and excitement this dress was available in my size. They overnighted it to me and it got to me in time for my 3:00 wedding. Got SO many compliments on it! The embroidery is absolutely stunning and the dress was heavy enough to keep me warm at an October wedding on the water. The only thing I was nervous about was the straps being too thin to support the weight of the dress but it was totally fine. I didn't want to send the dress back I loved it so much!","October 8, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL220","Erin","RTR Team Review","I love this dress for a fall wedding. I actually wore it to an Indian wedding where a lot of other guests wore saris, and felt like it fit right in! It fits true to size, but has no stretch. I'm 5'2"" and it came to just an inch or so above the ground on me- a slightly awkward length but not enough that it looked bad. I have a narrow rib cage so it was a little loose on me standing. Though I ended up being glad about that after dinner. As many other reviewers have noted, you don't need a bra because the fabric is thick and somewhat structured. I was worried the skinny straps would dig into my shoulders but it wasn't a problem.","October 4, 2018","Wedding"

This dress is beautiful and looks great on and did the job but was not the best. It's extremely heavy, so hot and felt like it was pulling my ass flat. Also the sizing is wildly off. Thank good for reviews I got the 10 and I think I should've even gone up a size from that (regularly a 2 or 4). You can see in the picture it was bunching a lot and I had to be pulling it down and adjusting all night. Size up!","December 11, 2019","Formal Affair"

The dress is such a classic and the long sleeves were great for the cold ballroom but comfortable enough to dance around in. I went without a bra. The material was thick enough and held up well. The neckline was interesting and flattering, and the slit made it alluring.","December 11, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN30","RTR Customer","Get those angles right!","This skin tight stunner definitely makes a statement and stands out in a crowd. Highly recommend for thin, narrow, and small chested types. Euro sizing, add 2 extra sizes on your US size to adequately fit. Highly recommend for formal affairs with dancing with modest coverage but the slit allows for movement. Thick fabric with good amount of stretch allows for a warm, comfortable yet stunning statement dress. Pair with statement earrings and pull your hair back for the full effect!","November 4, 2019","Formal Affair"

I wore it as a bridesmaid in a black tie wedding and it was perfect for the occasion. I'm not sure why all the reviews were mentioning to size up.. I rented 1 size up and in hindsight wish I went with my normal size. The invisible zipper makes it easy enough to slip on and the fabric is thick and tight in a way that sucks you in but isn't constraining. Because of the high side slit I didn't use shapewear and it was totally fine.","September 23, 2019","Wedding"

Since the dress is in European sizes, order at least two sizes up. I typically wear a 4R and the 10R fit perfectly. For someone who straddles between petite and non-petite sizes the length of the dress was perfect with a modest heel. The sleeves ran a bit long. The material of the dress is a bit on the medium/heavier side, but worked very well for an early Spring outside wedding on the east coast. I was never too hot or too cold from the 5pm outside ceremony to late night cocktails. No jacket necessary.","May 28, 2019","Small"

I wore it to a Washington black tie event, so I wanted to be beautiful but respectful and serious. This dress did it. I received a million compliments but still felt smart. I was not sure how well it would fit without spanx or a bra, but you really don't ned either - the dress does all the tucking and shaping for you! I am not in the shape I used to be and my breast size is still larger from nursing our second child, but rest assured that the dress covered all that up and held things up nicely. It does run slightly small and it is a bit difficult to put on. But once you get it past your shoulders it's fine. The fabric is slightly heavy, which worked great in a slightly windy spring evening but might be too thick for summer. Also, I wanted it longer so I ordered L. It was just a bit, maybe one inch too long (I am slightly over 5'6"" and wore a 2.75"" heel).","April 14, 2019","Formal Affair"

I felt super sexy and elegant all night long! I did take into consideration what other reviewers said about sizing, however, I think it was still hard to decide on which was the perfect sizing for myself. I do love the fact that Rent The Runway lets you choose two different sizings of the dress; I found that to be very helpful, otherwise, my original size would not have worked (0 in U.S. / *4R in Euro - I ended up wearing the 2 in U.S. / *6R in Euro). Also, I am 5'5, therefore, I was stuck between which length to order, either regular or long, but the regular length hit the floor perfectly with my shoes on ( 1/2 in heel); however, I would have been more comfortable with the long for the mere fact that I wouldn't have to keep pulling it down all night. I would recommend this dress any day! Hope my review is helpful for the next renter.","February 11, 2019","Small"

My only complaint is that the sides around the waist stick out a bit due to the back detail. Also definitely recommend the long - I am 5'6 and definitely needed the long with any type of heel.

I've a fairly true to size 8, and the 8R fit perfectly everywhere, it hugged all the right places to look super flattering. I was really torn whether or not to get the regular or long at 5'8"", especially with plans to wear 3 inch heels, but I went with the regular because I decided a slightly cropped look would be easier to walk around in than if it ended up too long. The regular length worked well, it wasn't all that cropped and came down to about my ankles where the top straps of my heels started. I would've been fine in the long length too, and if you're any taller than I am, I would definitely go with the long. It was surprisingly comfortable all night and the pockets were an added bonus. You can't wear a regular bra with it because of the back, but it's secure enough on the top you don't really need one, I went with some pasties just in case and that held up fine even with me jumping around and dancing half the night. Badgley Mischka is one of my favorite designers because all of their clothes always seem to fit perfectly while still being flattering and looking amazing, and this jumpsuit definitely held up to those standards.","June 19, 2019","True to Size"

A couple notes- if you're unsure or between sizes, size up- I'm almost back to a 2 so this was a bit tight but the fit was stunning and hugged every curve I wanted to show. If you're moderately endowed, go for the Hollywood lift tape rather than a strapless bra, it's thick enough to provide full coverage. The long felt almost too short, but the length hit exactly how it was supposed to. I paired with 4 inch pumps but was able to wear flats with no issue. The sequins scratched the $h!t out of my back where the zipper clasp was and the side of my shoulder- also left little scrapes on my arms but was worth it.

It fit very snug! There's no stretch so take that into account. No bra is necessary as the snugness around the bust area keeps the girls up.

As you can see it is so tight at the chest, so my breasts were pushed upward and I feel like it made me look heavier and chubbier on top than normal. I did receive compliments on the dress, as it is a beautiful color and the skirt portion is lovely but the fit on top was tough.

It looked lovely from stage, and since I didn't have much arm-moving to do, the snugness of the sleeves didn't bother me (though I wouldn't have been able to easily reach up past my shoulder had I needed to). The dress came creased and needed a good steam. The reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 was because it showed sweat marks around my armpits very easily. I only wore it for maybe 2 hours during each performance, but needed to insert my own dress shields, otherwise there would have been visible marks.

I'm 5'4"", with some 3"" heels the length was pretty spot on, it's shorter in the front and almost has a slight train in the back. It's also a pretty thick material, so it's fairly structured. I'm typically a size 6-8, I'm smaller on top and have more curves on the bottom, and the 6 was a perfect fit since this dress is more fitted on top and looser on the bottom. This is weird, but it photographed way better from this angle than from the front. Sounds weird, but may be helpful for any Instagram-ers.","January 12, 2019","Formal Affair"

These dresses are heavy and really need to be hung by the hangers loops inside and not the sleeves. So I would say do not size up on this one and if you have a short torso, it might not fit at the armpits and shoulders.","October 24, 2016","Party"

Paired with a denim jacket and booties, it worked! I had never worn Herve and was worried it would run small. It could have easily worn a S because the skirt is not fitted. The M was a little loose around the belly and under the arms. But with a jacket you couldn't notice.

The bottom part of the dress seemed fine but the top was huge! I am 5'10 and a 36c and the straps kept buckling and slipping off my shoulders and the back was gapping. Also it was super low cut which I think was due to the straps being either stretched out or too big (though my husband would have been fine with that!!)

It was very comfortable to wear all evening at the formal Christmas party to which I wore it. I loved the asymmetrical detail and had no problem wearing a regular strapless bra with the dress. I did put some fashion tape on the top edge of the bra cup underneath the cut out just to make sure my bra didn't peek out. I received so many compliments on this dress. I will note that when the dress arrived, it had a very noticeable stain right on the front, but I was able to hide it by pinching it from behind with a safety pin and blending it in with the other ruched folds.

I like asymmetrical hems But I felt this piece to be a little off in how it fell and draped. It isn't as flattering on as I had hoped but the material is comfortable and the shape is forgiving. The material is a sporty mesh and is breathable and easy to wear in summer weather. The sleeves are boxy and large as other reviewers have mentioned but I like that, I think if you want more shape up top, size down or pair with something to change the silhouette.","August 13, 2019","Everyday"

Dress was comfortable and the asymmetrical hem made it interesting. It's got a kind of sporty nylon fabric similar to breathable workout clothes, so it didn't wrinkle easily.

I'll be dressing this down this weekend - throwing on some moto boots and calling it streetwear. Some things to note: the colors are not as bright in real life as you can see by my (mostly) unedited photo. The top on this runs large. The material does not feel expensive but is very lightweight and comfortable. It's actually a woven mesh material up close. This brand has a super cool vibe.","August 5, 2019","Large"

The skirt was cute and the cut of the skirt was great, but the v-neck was awkward and the shoulders were boxy with too-long sleeves. The material was similar to sportswear so it ended up feeling like a tennis dress or running shirt. Ultimately it wasn’t the right look for me so I sent it back without wearing it, though it did fit me well.","December 23, 2019","Everyday"

Cons: I never knew that boning could break but by the time I got to the venue the boning in the front of my dress popped out through the lace. Also as is the case with the other Marchesa dresses I've rented, the zipper is stubborn around the waist area. Seems like cheap zippers with luxury fabric.","July 24, 2019","Wedding"

This dress got compliments all night, and they continued into the following week following my social media post (it counts because I never get comments on my outfit on social media, haha). I usually am a size 4, but rented the 2, and it stretched in the bottom throughout the evening, so I'd suggest sizing down. The arms were a bit tight but I also stitched them a bit due to the nude lining showing (which other people mentioned). My quick fix allowed it to not show that much. I would definitively recommend this dress despite the sleeves","July 15, 2019","Wedding"

I wore it to a fundraiser gala that was a mix of cocktail attire and formal gowns. I'm 125 lbs, 34c so I went with the 4r. I'm 5'3"" and you can see the R was long on me...other than that, it fit perfectly. The upper bodice is a corset so I didn't need to wear a bra, and the dress over all is beautifully and well made so I didn't need shapewear (about 75% of the time I do). I had to iron the bow because it was no longer attached to the belt, it looked like it had been sewn on at one point but it was no longer attached causing the bow and its tails to become wrinkled. This was an easy fix. I would absolutely rent this dress again and highly recommend.","June 3, 2019","True to Size"

This was my first time using RTR and I will definitely be back for more events in the future; it was soo easy and I got a beautiful dress! Even my backup style dress (which was also by the same designer as this dress-Marchesa Notte) that I got for free was beautiful as well— I was so sad I couldn’t wear it but hopefully I’ll have the opportunity to rent it again. I am usually fluctuating anywhere between a 2-6 in dress sizes (usually just 2-4 but if it runs really small I get a 6) depending on the cut, fabric, fit, etc. I believe my TRUE size is a 4 so maybe this dress runs a little on the larger size because I ordered a 4R as my size and I got the 2R as my free backup size; I actually ended up wearing the 2R to my event. The 4 fit well but the 2 just sucked me in a little tighter so that’s why I went with that size. Loved the dress! Got so many compliments and everyone flooded my inbox asking where it was from after I posted pictures on Facebook and Instagram of me in the dress.

The fabric is very light - I could not wear a black strapless bra with this because it showed right through.

I'm small busted and didn't wear a bra but I still needed to safety pin the bust or I would have shown all my goods. I'm not sure how to wear this with a bra... all that being said, I still received a lot of complements, the fabric was breezy, and the pleated skirt was a nice detail.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend ordering your true size for your primary size. This style is fitted at the chest but the straps are completely adjustable. The waist band is elastic and the skirt part is very flowy and loose. It works best for A-C cup sizes because of how skin-bearing the top is and there can be some side-boob depending on how tight you tie the straps. At 5'3 the length hit mid-thigh on me, I also had the straps tied very tight to make it short enough on my shorter frame. The fabric on this is beautiful and lightweight. Pair with delicate heels or sandals to complete your look!","May 8, 2018","True to Size"

Neither my original size nor backup fit (4, 6) and I had to get another size down to a 2 and honestly could have fit into a 0. The main issue is that the straps are very long and not adjustable. I really wanted to make the dress work and with a decent amount of fabric tape, it looked great. Once I got it set up, everything held in place and I was not worried about it.

I recommend doing the ""sit test"" in this dress. Standing up, it fit great (even though I feel it runs a bit large, so I ended wearing the size 4, which I almost never fit into!) When I sat the down, the clasp holding the front together kept coming undone. I felt very self-conscious the entire dinner, but luckily I brought a shawl, which I kept wrapped around me the entire. Kind of defeats the purpose of wearing a nice dress! Also, I tried 3 different type of bras, and none of them worked. I ended going braless with nipple pasties.

Also, I ordered the long size vs regular because a lot of people, my height, had said was short in their reviews but I could have wore the regular length. Lastly, the front area had a weird tab on the drape which looked like it had detached from somewhere. I didn't know what to do with it so I tucked it inside so no one would see it.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM125","RTR Customer","8 months pregnant :: dress is lovely and worked, but wasn't ideal -- issues with length and fit.","I rented this dress to wear to a black tie gala in January. I read many reviews of fellow renters who chose this dress (and a few others) because it's very bump-friendly. While that is true, and it is a beautiful dress, the length of the dress varies greatly from one size to the next. I was 8 months pregnant wearing it, and all belly. My pre-pregnancy size would probably be a 2L or 4L. I ordered the 6L and 10L (the 8 was not available). The 6L fit except for the fact that it stopped at my shins. I'm 5'6 and planned to wear 2"" heels. I wore the 10L. As you can see, the dress was very loose in the back, arms, chest (34B), and hips. It was the perfect length with 2"" heels. The 6L would have been much better, and I can't imagine why it would be feet shorter than the same dress, just 2 sizes up. I realize that some of that extra material was to cover my bump, but still... there was a vast difference in the length. It all worked out -- I felt beautiful and it was nice to have a dress that was comfortable while very pregnant. For the pregnant renters out there -- if you're all belly, this probably isn't the right dress for you. Definitely covers the bump, but sizing up for length and belly coverage means too big of a dress overall. Overall service, delivery, and communication with RTR was perfect. I will definitely rent again!","January 23, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN61","Rindy","Perfect for a spring (indoor) wedding!","This dress fit true-to-size, and I was able to wear the size 10. As other reviewers have noted, the waist is banded with a ribbon which has ZERO stretch to it. If I didn't hold in my stomach, the dress in profile was not super flattering. But if you don't mind a little pouch, the overall look of the dress was very up-scale and elegant. The lace of the outer layer is light green, light blue/purple and ivory and looks very expensive and well done. The under layer is actually a light green and has stretch to it, but the lace of the outer layer prevents any significant ""give."" So, best to order a size that will fit and not try to squeeze into a smaller size. While I am somewhat busty (36E) I had no problem with cleavage showing, or feeling over exposed - which may have more to do with my 57 year old figure than the dress itself. But I was able to wear a normal bra with it and did not have to wear a strapless contraption. This made the entire evening much more comfortable. I don't know that my shoulders are particularly broad, but I had no problem with the sleeves staying up and did not need or use fashion tape to hold everything together - as others have said. Edited to add: As I look back now on the pictures of the event and reflect on how I felt at the time, this dress made me feel as pretty as I have ever been.

The color and style was perfect for the look I was going for, but the sizing was a little off for my body type. I wore the zero and I'm a 32B and the top was too large. My hips were snug in the dress so the proportion is better for someone with larger boobs or broader shoulders and smaller hips.

My sister remarked that it looked like it was custom made for me! The two biggest downsides are: 1) the sleeves are very loose for petite people - as other reviewers had said, fashion tape is a MUST to keep the sleeves from slipping down, and 2) I'm very petite (5'1"", 120 lbs, wide hips) so the dress falls mid-calf, which can make you look very short. It's gorgeous in photos from the knees up, but if a picture is showing your full body (as in the one I shared), you look tiny. Other than that, it is BEAUTIFUL and I would highly recommend it!

I got tons of compliments! I'm usually an 8 but got the 10 bc I always worry about jumpers and rompers. It fit perfectly so I would say size up. One drawback is it was very fitted around my butt. I'm 5'4 and if I was even a half inch taller it wouldn't have worked. So consider getting the tall if you're over 5'4. I will definitely rent this again!","May 16, 2019","Party"

I liked so much, I'm considering buying and who would have guessed such a bright unconventional work option looked SO good with a fitted blazer and some snake skin booties. It seems revealing, but the back is completely covered and wasn't much different than a sleeveless shirt. Take a chance and treat yourself. Update: after wearing all say as a 5'7"" woman, when I bend or lean forward, it's constricting on the neck because it has not stretch or give. Still really liked!","January 29, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MQA5","Lisa e","Gorgeous","The fabric (though a synthetic) is silky and luxe, very thin but it’s like a whisper over your skin. The cut is magical - it doesn’t have a zipper or any closure or stretch and yet it slips on over your head and then arranges itself on your body as if someone sewed you into it. The neck is hard to see in the rtr photo and I thought it might have been a bit off one shoulder but it’s actually more like a slight cowl. Fit: the main thing is that the asymmetrical hemline is very long - I needed it to do double duty from work to going out so I wore ankle boots with just a small heel and it barely worked (in my pic I’m wearing socks and you can see it’s touching the floor). It’s fairly tight through the shoulders and bust and the XS will probably fit a 0 or 2 best. It’s probably a little too dressy for work but it was too amazing for me to send it back without wearing and I didn’t end up getting it in time for the Xmas party I originally ordered it for.","December 9, 2019","Party"

Cons: The neck is designed very strangely, it chokes at the neck and pulls under the armpits making it very difficult to move around.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR65","RTR Customer","So much to love about this dress!","I LOVED wearing this dress! The fit was perfect- tight enough to give me a figure and loose enough to hide my post baby belly. The length was great for a cocktail party. I would describe this dress as flirty and classy at the same time! I am busty on top (36DD) but smaller on the bottom. I am very glad I got the large. Definitely recommend sizing up if you are busty.","February 18, 2019","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR65","Tiffany","Favorite Dress Ever","I love this trendy dress by Saylor! Running true to size with a little stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this style so you should wear nubra or no bra since there is an open back. At 5’3”, the length hit mid-thigh on me. The dress is amazing in person. Pair with black heels and fun earrings to complete your outfit! The material is thick and it is such an affordable rental as well!","February 16, 2019","True to Size"

The fit is true to size, and slightly fitted through the middle where the band hits. There is some stretch in it though, so it has a little give. It is pretty short, but I'm not tall and was wearing with flats so wasn't a concern. I got tons of compliments on the dress, and it was a fun change from a lot of simpler black dresses at the event I wore it to.","February 13, 2019","Party"

I believe the multiple rental use caused the zipper to get stuck. But my fiancé and I figured it out - definitely need two people and lots of patience. Only reason I subtracted one star from this review. It is pretty comfortable. I was able to dance in this dress with no restrictions. And great for petites.

If you have a larger chest/torso to a petite frame, I would definitely recommend sizing up so that you can zip. The skirt of the dress reaches a little below my knee in the calf area.

But because of the open back you clearly can't wear a bra, so would be great for my sisters with smaller breasts; but on the other hand the breast area of the dress runs rather large and even my un-swaddled breasts didn't fill out the large side-boob area. Not sure who would be flattered by this but I think silicone must be involved.","May 13, 2019","Large"

As for my pic, the reason I threw on the jean jacket is b/c I was going out to dinner on a wed night and felt over dressed. I disagree with the other reviews that this can be dressed up or down.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP76","Angie","Cute, nicely structured top","I feel like this runs true to size for the brand - which runs large overall. That said, this shirt is made to be form fitting but is made of a nice, smoothing material, so being +/-1 size from your normal is no big deal. The material in the arms is much thinner, stretchier and less compressing. I ended up 2 sizes from what I'd normally wear in this brand, and the only place I felt it was how the top piece of fabric sat when I wasn't sitting up super straight. It was really only noticeable to me, as I got tons of compliments.","October 12, 2018","Large"

The ""high"" part of the high-low hit me below the knee as pictured, It's long, in heels it was just above the ground. The skirt is full and I loved it! Made getting into and out of the car a bit complicated but so worth it. I am not comfortable in strapless bras, so I was hoping to be able to wear a normal bra with this dress. The dress cuts just inside the bra straps, but I WAS able to cross my bra straps with no showing. Would be fine with a strapless, too, obviously.

There is piping around the waist and next in velvet, and the blue patterns on the lace really felt luxurious. The shoulders/cap sleeves were a little restrictive, but not so bad you couldn't dance in it. So many co-workers came up and said, ""Oh my God, I didn't even realize that was you, but I was just admiring that dress! You look amazing!"" It was a bit snug on my frame at a 16R, and I tend to take a 14 or 16 right now at 5'7"" and some change and at close to 200lbs. That said, I felt like a zillion bucks. One last note. There is a layer of 'nude' tulle under the black lace on the neckline that may not work for folks with darker complexions. While I am as pale as the tulle, it annoyed me to see that, as I have many a friend who would love to wear that dress that this may stand out on. Jury is out, though.","October 3, 2018","Small"

The pattern and golden tones jumped out to me right away and when I received the dress the coloring with the satin-y finish was even more beautiful. The fit is lose and flowy and the skirt moves wonderfully. With both a smaller inner button and the large outer button the dress felt secure and I never feared it was going to fly open. The skirt separation looks particularly high in the picture but that's mostly due to my awkward hand placement and trying to balance on the moving swing; when standing the skirt closes much more than some other wrap dresses and even during some wind I didn't have to worry much about anything showing. I ended up with a size 3R as that was the only size left. If I had the choice I probably would have chosen the 2R but getting the 3 was really a blessing in disguise as the looser fit matches the style of dress much better.","May 21, 2019","True to Size"

The biggest con is similar to what other posts have commented on. This dress needs cover up for smaller breasted women. I hated to have to wear a bralette but needed one to hide/cover what little peoples I have. For women that are more blessed - there shouldn't be an issue. Additionally, I had to wear 6"" heels and the tail did drag a bit. I am petite in nature but cannot wear petite clothes. I'm a size 0 in regular sizes.

I had on 4 inch heels and I still needed to pick up the hem and be very mindful of it while going up or down stairs (it was fine walking). The zipper goes all the way up the back. I was getting ready by myself so had to get creative and loop a clothes hanger through the zipper go I could get it all the way up.

I have a large, full breast shape (36DDD tear drop shape) and wore this dress with an unlined underwire bra, worked out just fine. the top is a bit tight, but in a good way IMO - holds everything in tight without cutting into your skin.i think a more padded/structured bra would have made me need an even larger size, so keep that in mind when ordering. i didn't try the dress on with no bra, but that probably would've worked too. no shapewear needed! i added the pearl belt to accessorize it, i felt it accentuated my waistline. my heels were about 4in tall and that was just right for the long length. didn't step on it at all during the night, even during vigorous dancing.","June 10, 2019","Formal Affair"

It fit perfectly and made me feel so confident. I have a larger chest so the neckline was perfect--it gave me coverage while still being a little sexy with the tight bodice and the fun slit (there's probably a better fashion term for this, but I don't know it). I am 5'8"" and wore 1.5"" heels and the dress was a bit too long (not a big problem, I was just a little worried it would be stepped on), so either wear higher heels or order the regular. I usually go for black dresses and feel boring doing so, but this dress' shape and design was unique, I didn't feel like I was wearing something I already owned. And because it is black, you can go almost any way with the accessories. All in all, I loved this dress and if I had more fancy occasions (and more $), I would have seriously considered buying it.

I am a bit broad in the rib cage area, so that could have been why it fit me tighter there. The size 14L was a bit tight around the area where it caused ""arm fat"" to hang over the dress in the underarm area. I choose to wear the 16L although it was big in the chest area. I put fabric take on and a thicker bra and it worked out fine. I normally wear a size 12 to 14. I had so many compliments on this dress.

Yes, I could have worn it, but I just wouldn't be comfortable. The good thing is that because of the gathering, you can pin the top and hide it. The sash on the dress gives it a more casual nod to the overall style and is why I rented it. I was sad that it didn't work, but would suggest for smaller people - it is a lovely dress.","June 18, 2019","Wedding"

Waist is small and my back was a little big for it, but fine once hooked in. I think a C or D cup would be good for it.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works best for A-C cup. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear no bra due to cut of dress. At 5'0"", the length was long on me. This dress was fun and flirty but be aware of the low cut on the bust area. Pair with your favorite pair of heels and a statement accessory to complete your outfit!","April 15, 2018","True to Size"

I almost didn't wear it, but I didn't want to waste the rental and wore it to work. I received a ""gasping"" comment about the beauty of the embroidery from a coworker. I tried it with a belt, but liked it better without. This is a dress you wear to show off the dress, and not to show off your figure.

I ordered a size 8 when usually wear a 6 because another customer noted that it runs small in the bust. This was accurate. The 8 fit perfectly. I am short and worried it would be too long, but length was not an issue. Despite how much I loved the dress overall, I didn't end up wearing it. I ordered it for a First Communion but as the neckline of the dress really highlights the decolletage I think it's more appropriate for a garden party.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM422","Kristin","This dress made me feel GORGEOUS!!! I never wanted to take it off or return it!!","I ordered this dress for a wedding I was attending. I wanted something that would be a little bit warm and elegant--also appropriate for a winter wedding. I love all things sparkly, and so when I saw this dress online, I knew I had to try it. I was nervous being that I am very short that the dress would be too long. However, I wore these soft pink 4inch heels with it, and the REGULAR length fit perfectly. I was shocked since I usually need to wear petite length. I was also pleasantly surprised that I did not need to wear a bra with this dress even though, I am very busty. The dress has very supportive lining to hold you in place. It would be remiss for me not to mention the quality customer service I received. Two days prior to when my order was scheduled to ship, I received an email that my ""backup size"" was unavailable! I searched the website and then I finally called RTR the night before it was supposed to ship. The customer sales representative I spoke to was very helpful and even sent me two additional ""backups."" My complete order arrived on time, which is impressive and awesome. Evidently, I didn't need the backups since the original dress fit perfectly, but it was super comforting to know I had options, and they really helped me to feel ready for my event. Overall, I love the color--it's a very subtle rose gold, the sweetheart/off-the shoulder neckline was very flattering, the sequins were surprisingly comfortable and not scratchy, and I was able to dance and move no problem! This dress really showed off my figure in a very feminine way, and just made me feel so sexy and confident. I will 100% rent this dress again when the opportunity arises!!! The pictures I took do not even do this dress justice! It is even more gorgeous in person.","February 18, 2020","True to Size"

I knew I was going to be dancing though and the material around your arms is super tight and not as stretchy as the rest of the dress.

I'm 5'5"" and wore three inch heels, but my toes were a little visible as the dress didn't touch the floor. Was great - no tripping hazard, but longer would have been better for pictures. Beware! There is a lining and a second layer of thicker fabric. I thought that the dress was bunching up around my waist because it was too big. My date and a friend tried to figure it out, but we couldn't. Wasn't til later that I discovered the inner layer. (Maybe I'm not meant to dress up?) Please give this dress a try - you won't be disappointed!","February 5, 2020","True to Size"

Couple things to note, however: 1) double sided tape is a MUST (and bring extra in case you have to disrobe to use the facilities...), and 2) there is zero stretch, so you can't size down to avoid the chest gap. I had no issues with side chest peaking out but only because I used a lot of tape. I tried to wear a stick on/backless bra but the sides went up too high, so I went without; the fabric was thick enough that it was okay to do so. I'm 5'5 and wore 3 inch heels with it.

Was very comfortable and I felt like a million bucks. While it fit well for the most part, there is not a lot of material in the front.. so I would definitely invest in double-sided tape and prepare for boob slips (not nip slips). Most of the night I wore a fur vest over the jumper because I have large breasts and without it, the slightest movement would've cause a peep show.

The lining wear the ruffle starts made it a little tighter but was a good fit it was wearable but a size 4 would have been more comfortable. If you're curvier deff size up!

The little ruffly part starts lower than I feel like it should, giving you a weird saddlebag effect on either hip (especially if you aren't wide-hipped enough to fill it out). I think the size might have been tricky, too, as I could have worn almost two sizes down from it if I didn't have booooooooobs for days. The top was tight while the rest of it was way too big.

As other reviewers note, this dress wrinkles easily so I did steam it before wearing it. The wedges were perfect for the length of the dress. To walk in the parade, I needed to hold the dress up the entire time because the dress was too long. But I received so many compliments and everyone loved it!

I normally only wear neutral colors, so I was a real skeptic, BUT the colors are slightly faded/washed, so it isn't obnoxiously bright. It is lightweight, and ridiculously comfortable. I was worried that it would make me look big because it hides my waist, but the striping is SO flattering, and the ruffles lay long, so it still accentuated my waist. To sum it up, it is impossible to not be happy in this dress. The only con is that it took me about 30 minutes to steam, but it was well worth it. Totally recommend!","October 1, 2018","True to Size"

I'm 5'9"" tall and my normal dress size is a 6/8 - I ended up wearing a 10L because Marchesa runs quite small.

It's also a stretchy fabric so I feel like it would be comfortable. The dress however runs extremely small. I usually rent 16/18. I hate when dresses like this fit too tightly (I prefer them fitted but skimming my body like the model) so I sized up to a 20L. I could barely zip the dress in the back and the slit at my hips was gaping open. I think I'd need to go up at least 2 more sizes to have it fit as desired. Not sure if small fits are standard for the designer or if these are British sizes but this was an overall 'hell no' for me. Also, since this was a clear not, I didn't try the dress on with shape-wear. This dress would definitely benefit from shape-wear though since the material is quite thin.","June 11, 2019","Small"

It fit my bust fine, but it was difficult to zip over my rib cage, so I wore a backless stick-on bra and it worked out, but it still felt really snug. It was also very fitted in the hips. I think this cut would fit slightly better on someone with a straighter or less curvier shape, or sizing up if there is a large difference between your waist and hips.

It looks so much better on. I received several compliments on this dress. I wanted to wear this to the wedding but decided to wear it to the rehearsal dinner instead just because the other dress I got had more room for dancing. This would be fine but doesn't stretch at all. The biggest downside to this dress was just that it shows wear easily so it had a number of threads from the beading and lace that were coming loose, not really a big deal. Overall, this dress was a hit, and I'd recommend it!","October 24, 2018","True to Size"

Some of the beading on the bodice and sleeves was a little roughed up, but not noticeable at first glance.

Was worried it would not look good since it has a fitted silhouette, and I am a thicker girl, but ended up loving it on. Felt very classy, yet sexy. It was a little smaller than expected, glad I had gone up in the backup size. Was also a bit worried about the mesh neck (typically hate that type of thing), but didn't mind it at all. Wore my hair in a partial french twist directing my hair over one shoulder so that it would still be down, but also show off the beautiful sleeves and back. Few loose threads, no scratchiness.","April 18, 2018","Small"

I should have been wearing a zero. I’m generally small all over, B bust, which would matter, as the material is not stretchy.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN42","Melissa","Art deco appropriate.","I wore this as the mother of the groom to a Roaring 20s themed wedding. I wanted to go elegant, rather than flapper style. Everyone thought it was beautiful. I usually wear a Sz 4, but ended up wearing the Sz 2 backup. The 4 looked large on the hanger, so I never tried it on. The Sz 2 fit great, with a little help from a stapless bra. Without a bra, the waist wouldn't sit in the right place, since I am flat chested -- I needed some lift there. Waist was comfy in this smaller size, I could move easily. I did not experience the itch from the material like other wearers, I found it perfectly comfortable. The sheer neckline is a little weird, but the necklace I rented with the dress completely covered it, making it look like just a low cut neckline. I probably would have to go back up to the Sz 4 if I gained any more weight, the Sz 2 fit like a glove. I am small, but not rail thin. I received compliments all evening, and felt appropriately dressed as the mom of the groom. It is an elegant dress.","June 21, 2017","True to Size"

This was a very different dress than my usual style and a little outside of my comfort zone. I was not in love with this dress but I received a lot of compliments on it. The detailed sleeves really make the dress special and glamorous. Unfortunately the sleeves were showing some wear - beads and sequins were falling off and there were some loose threads. The length was perfect - it came to my knees (I'm 5'2""). The lining of the dress would peek out from the dress at times, which was kind of annoying. I also did not like that the mesh lining on the top of the dress was a dark flesh color (it was kind of sheer but still darker than my skin tone - and I had a little bit of a tan). I was worried the lining would look weird (I was self conscious of it), but luckily it wasn't that noticeable in pictures. Despite all of this, people loved this dress. It photographs really well. It's sophisticated, and the details on the dress, especially the sleeves, are stunning.","May 21, 2017","Formal Affair"

It was very comfortable, and isn't too tight that I felt like I had to suck it in all night. I didn't feel like the underarms were scratchy at all. I wore a nude strapless bra with it, which fit perfectly. My only issue with the dress is that it had a lot of loose strings on the cap sleeves.

The smocked, zippered back was the only reason I could wear it to my event. The large was still snug but, the give in the back was enough to make this work. I can usually fit into a standard medium (6-8) top. I was glad that I had the back up size available because there was no way I would have been able to even zip up the medium. If you are busty I would suggest looking for another top that has more give.","March 28, 2018","Small"

I am 5'9"" and the long was perfect because I could wear heels...which for a taller person is great! The ruffle is gorgeous and the silhouette is on point. I have a little bit more of an hour glass figure & the only con to this dress was it fit wonderfully everywhere but was a little snug in the hips. I wore the 6L, however, I think the 8 would have been too big. Although it was snug through the hips, it was still comfortable!","October 28, 2019","Formal Affair"

I ordered the 6L and the 8R - I can often fluctuate between the two sizes. While I could have fit in the 6, it saw pretty snug and I ended up going with the 8 very comfortably -- even in the larger size, the fabric is thick and fitted & I didn't have to wear a bra (which almost never happens for me). With 3-4"" heels, the L would have been better but the regular length wasn't too bad since the slit in the gown makes any extra length super easy to trip on.","September 3, 2019","True to Size"

I literally got compliments all night long and didn't want to send it back after the event! As a note: I was a little hesitant about the dress because of issues folks mentioned with how the top fit. It is a very odd cut that really didn't allow for a traditional strapless bra. A Nu Bra (adhesive) worked well for me (32C).","June 18, 2019","Formal Affair"

The slanted bottom edge is definitely edgy but probably my favorite part of this dress! The sleeves fit well, almost a bit tight, but that was necessary for the off-shoulder to stay in place.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/IRO22","RTR Customer","Stylist Review","I am absolutely obsessed with this flashy, fun dress by Iro!! It runs true to size so I would recommend wearing your usual size as your primary and going one size up as your backup size. This style is fitted throughout the mid section and form fitted at the hips, however it is not too tight so it is definitely a comfortable piece. The dress is great for any cup size and could be worn with a standard or strapless bra. In regards to length, this hits me at the mid thigh. Again, I love all the sequins and how flashy this dress is! Just add a pair of black or nude heels, a pair of earrings and a little black handbag and you are a good to go for a night on the town!","January 11, 2019","True to Size"

However, the fit was still flattering despite the waist being so lose thanks to the cut. My typical size zipped but barely, and would have been uncomfortable to wear. Go with a size up! The armpits are quite large and show a bit of side boob if your arms are raised.

I admittedly have fuller hips, but I couldn't even begin to get the zipper going. I wish I could just size up, but I know that with only one larger size than what I tried it still wouldn't work. I would either size up a couple from your normal size or just skip this one if you have a round booty! If you're more narrow through the hips though this might work great for you.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/IRO22","Lisa e","Way too small - order at least 4 sizes up","I read the reviews and ordered this 2 sizes larger than usual and I would say it was still 2 inches away from being able to zip. It's a shame because the sequins around the zipper are very delicate and these dresses are all going to get destroyed from people trying to cram themselves into a dress that doesn't fit. I ordered it 2 more sizes up hoping that might fit as it's really cute but I ordered something else as backup because I am not optimistic. Will update the review. Update: I also tried this in a 40, and weirdly it was plenty big - it seemed way more than just 2 sizes bigger than the 36, and I probably couldn't have worn the 38. The top on the 40 (unsurprisingly) was a little overly voluminous, and I had ordered a second dress as backup which I ultimately decided was more my style. This is a beautiful dress, but definitely be careful about the sizing.","December 30, 2018","Small"

The styling has a vintage flare which is something I usually love, but the large midsection in combination with the vintage look has the unfortunate effect of making you look like you're a little girl trying on a dress from grandma's closet.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSN26","Jasmine","Loved the 70s vibe!","Definitely the most popular outfit I’ve worn to work. I got quite a few “Foxxy Cleopatra” references too. (I’ll take it!) it’s very easy to put on, isn’t tight in the torso for my almost. 5”9 frame and doesn’t pull at the neck. The only issue was that there was a noticeable inch of space in the chest area, where it had been stretched out from larger chests. I anticipated this since I am a B cup, so I just tightened the strap as much as I could to at least stop my chest area from showing past the seam. Overall, this jumpsuit was very comfortable and fun to wear! - jasleigh","November 8, 2018","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT49","Lauren","Not as wearable as I had hoped","I was hoping to wear this to a bday dinner with friends and possibly to work (ha!), but ended up way too risky for either. I think I’d only wear this on vacation. It looks like a wrap dress, but it isn’t—I thought I’d be able to just wrap it more to minimize how low cut it is, but it is not adjustable. One pro of it not being a wrap dress is that you don’t have to worry about the bottom flapping open—it is sewn all along the hem. It is very short—I’m 5’6” and it was hard for me to sit without fear of flashing someone. It comes lined with a silky soft slip, but even the slip is incredibly low cut—so much so that there’s no way I could wear a bra. I am small chested but the structure of the neckline is very flimsy, scoots around, and I know if I wore it out of the house I wouldn’t be able to focus on anything or enjoy myself because I’d be so self conscious about checking my dress. Last thing I had a problem with is the sleeves. My arms are a normal size and the hem from the sleeve to wear the fabric “flutters” is kind of tight. It bugged me just in having it on for a few minutes. Sad to be sending this back because I love the pattern and overall style, but just was a total flop for me. I’d recommend it to someone shorter that me, and would advise using some safety pins to secure the chest area. Bigger busted girls beware and good luck.","March 9, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM309","RTR Customer","Stylist Review","I LOVE this elegant dress by Nicole Miller! Running true to size , I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted all around and gives you a nice classy look for any formal occasion. It works best for all cup sizes and can be worn with a strapless bra . At 5’2”, the length stops me at tea length and with a black color pair of heels will complete your outfit! Adding a nice handbag and light jewelry accessory will give it its fashionable touch.","August 17, 2018","True to Size"

If you want a tight fit then I recommend going with your true size but it’s you want a little room to move, I say size up. The sequins didn’t bother or rub my arms, the only issue I had was that I didn’t have full range of motion in the arms and shoulders because of the style of the dress.

The color is beautiful.","Take this review with a grain of salt as I wore this at 29 weeks pregnant so I'm not entirely sure how to describe my body. I am 5'7"" and usually wear a size 8 pre-pregnant. Based on sizing info from other pregnant reviewers I ordered that size and one size up in a different color as a backup. The fit is very forgiving except around the chest band. I had a bit of a panic getting the zipper up, but once it got past the band and fastened I was not too worried about busting out. I wear a 36 B-C and did not feel the need for a bra. I love that it had adjustable straps. I wish I could have worn the size up in the pink color I ordered, but for some reason that size 10 dress fit smaller (I could not get the zipper up at all) than the blue size 8. The color was beautiful (it's not really navy as it appears online but more of a gem blue), the dress had a nice flow, and was fun to wear.","March 18, 2020","True to Size"

This ended up being a great option for maternity because of how flowy it was in the belly area. This is actually my backup dress but I'm so happy that I had it. I will say that I am currently wearing a 32c bra and the dress was a little snug under the breast. But it wasn't snug enough that if I sized up to a four that it would have worked, the four would have been too big overall, I was really happy with the dress and if you are trying to hide your belly this is a good fat but if you're trying to show it off I think it can work too.

The bottom pleats and ""flowiness"" of the dress make it elegant, comfortable and allow you to dress it up or down (I accessorized with very simple gold accents). It fits true to size, a little snug in the chest area depending on how top heavy you are, and the bottom did a great job hiding my ""mom pouch"". I find with EVERY RTR dress I've had...the zipper is very stiff and requires two people and a few seconds of holding your breath, I think because they are plastic and maybe the dry cleaning stiffens them.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JS116","Christina","A classic wedding with a twist at a historical Tennessee train station","This dress was great for my 26-week maternity bump. I wore between a 10-12 pre-pregnancy, a 12/L in maternity clothes, and ended up going with the 14R for this dress. The main fit factor for me was the bust--I was a a 36D pre-pregnancy and the girls have grown a bit, so the 14R in this dress worked with a strapless bra underneath. Because it's an empire waist, if you're comfortable with it you could probably get away with no bra. The best part about this dress for maternity is that the skirt is all expanding pleats, so it should fit over just about any sized bump. I'm on the short side, just barely 5'3"", so this fit me like a full-length gown rather than ankle-length, as shown on the model. That wasn't a problem for my event. My one complaint is that it's unlined in the skirt, so I was self-conscious about my giant maternity undies showing panty lines through the skirt. Overall, it was beautiful and comfortable.","September 25, 2018","True to Size"

The color is SMASHING and very bright. For a summer dress, it isn’t the lightest – it has a full cotton/opaque lining and a totally see-through eyelet layer on top. The arm holes are low but not so low that they show your bra – the looseness of the dress may result in a peek here and there, and it’s slightly racerback so your straps may show a little on the sides.","July 10, 2018","Large"

I am SO glad my other dress didn't work, not to mention that I saw someone wearing it at the event I was attending!! I have had my eye on this dress since it was released at RTR. Until now, I hadn't had an event that I thought it was appropriate for, plus it didn't have many reviews or pics of anyone wearing besides the models (shout out to all who review these dresses and post pics!). I took a chance on this dress and so glad I did. I am very busty (38 F/G) and this dress fit perfect. Also, I am hippy as well, but still fit great and I felt even better with good shape wear. I typically wear a 12 -14, mostly 14 in designer unless it runs large. In this dress, I wore a 16 and it fit perfectly. This has to be one of if not the most complimented dresses I have ever rented from RTR. I even had men stop me and compliment my dress! I wore this to a black tie optional event and it was perfect. Everyone loved it and I hope I can rent this again. Curvy girls, do not hesitate to rent..it will show off your shape fantastically! Loved everything about this dress from the lace detail, to the length and the color of the sequins. Rent this now!!","November 12, 2018","Formal Affair"

I have a larger chest (32DD) and the size SR fit perfectly. Easy to wear and even easier to take off! Very cute for a brunch date. My one complaint is that there is clearly space left for the butt but since I think I have a longer torso, the butt space sat on the small of my back instead of where my butt is supposed to be. Aside from this little problem, the dress is super cute. Highly recommend!","July 1, 2019","True to Size"

When I first put it on I thought to myself, ""Do I kinda look like a salsa or cabaret dancer...?"". I didn't! It was an elegant, yet SUPER FUN dress. I felt like my dress stood out over the other dresses at the ball...and my favorite, it was so early to dance in!

This was such a good choice for the event I went to. It was a Hindu wedding, so it had to be more conservative than my typical choice for a black tie event and when I placed the order, I was nervous it wouldn't really be a show piece, but I can say I was surprising wrong! The pictures don't do it justice and I had people coming up to me all night asking where I got the dress and telling me how stunning it looked! Definitely a show stopper!!

I'm 5'3"" and wore metallic booties with a .5"" sole and 4"" heels and the back of the dress was probably a little less than quarter-inch from the floor; just barely grazing the floor at times. My partner was worried about stepping on the dress and there was a moment or three when the dress got caught on something but it wasn't a distraction.

Everything from the cut, to the thickness of the fabric, and the stretch in all the right places made this dress a hit. It looked fabulous on all 5 bridesmaids, all with different body types.

One of the other bridesmaids also wore the same dress (see photo - I'm on the left, she's on the right) and it looked great on her, too. I chose a slightly looser fit by going with the 4R, though I could have worn the 2R; she also wore the 4R, which was slightly tighter for her.

This one was just off the mark by quite a bit. Too big, too long, too stiff. The keyhole in the back was perfectly placed to show my bra. A little higher or lower and I could've worn a normal bra with it. Strange snaps I couldn't figure out in the shoulders. I thought they were maybe to hold your bra in place and not show but didn't really work for that either. Mystery snaps. It was also somehow a tad frumpy and a bit childish at the same time.","May 9, 2019","Work"

I wore it to a black tie fundraiser for an art museum. Im 5'4"" and wore 3"" heels and the length was much longer on me than the model, but not too long. The lace is unique and definitely a show stopper. The only negative part was it was difficult to raise my arms because of how tight the sleeves were, but the comfort was 100% there!

I rented it for my honeymoon in Europe and definitely didn't mind the cleavage as much as I minded the bottom half flying open in the slightest breeze. Only wore it once to dinner because it was impossible to walk down the street in without flashing the locals. Might be a good dress if you wanted something to wear over a bathing suit at the beach but pretty impossible to wear in any other situation. It's a pretty dress when you're standing still though!

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because as others have said, the nude part of the off the shoulder straps would not tuck away and it really did annoy me but other than that I really did love tbis dress and felt absolutely beautiful in it!!","October 12, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN142","Jessica","Beautiful Dress!","Can't say enough about this dress. Total show stopper. Very comfortable, received many compliments. Perfect for a black tie wedding. I wore the 2 as opposed to the 4 because it fit better - wasn't too tight. (I didn't even try the 4 on because the 2 fit great) However I have to agree with many of the other reviews that the beige liner inside the dress was turning out on the arms. This was annoying as it's an expensive dress. Tacking with clothes pins was not that easy but we made it work.","October 10, 2018","True to Size"

But beware of the zipper!!","I rented this dress for a black tie high school reunion/fundraiser and absolutely loved it --once I was able to zip it. I'm a 12 normally but I ordered the 14 as a backup and I'm so happy I did! The 12 was wayyy too tight to be comfortable in and the 14 was easier to move in. BUT the zipper. The zipper would not budge over the middle after an hour of trying I had two friends working on it and they were finally able to get it. The dress fit me but the zipper with the lace isn't a good combo. I loved the dress and got compliments all night but I was really frustrated that such a nice dress had such a horrible zipper","September 25, 2018","Formal Affair"

I had it on for 6+ hours and received a TON of compliments on it. The drop sleeves were not too tight and the body of the dress allowed my body to move and not feel constricted. I usually wear a size 4 in dresses due to my long torso, but I wore the size 2 in this dress, and I felt it hit me in all the right places.

I loved the color and the neckline, but the bottom was a little billowy for my taste. The bottom also wrinkled super easily - I steamed it while I was wearing it to take pictures! The top fit a little snug (32DD) but the strapless were loose on me. At 5'2"" and typically a size 6, I thought the 8 fit well but ran a little small. It was cute overall for a party, but wasn't too upset about returning it!","June 25, 2019","Party"

Professional and sexy for a creative office - it's very fitted (I went with the S instead of XS to keep it from looking too painted-on) but also very covered up. The quality is outstanding - very thick material that keeps its form/doesn't stretch out, several different knit patterns which are beautiful close-up, and the cut of the hemline is fantastic in how it swings around when you walk. Could literally be crumpled up in a tote bag and would look great when you put it on. Slightly itchy especially in the sleeve area (bothered the inside of my elbow a bit by the end of the day). Will show lines and bumps underneath a bit so tights or shapewear are recommended. Turtleneck is quite long/high but it can be fit more normally than the scuba-like look on the model in the picture would suggest.","October 9, 2018","True to Size"

It's definitely form fitting, so I would recommend putting it on at least once or twice to loosen it up a bit. It is a stretchy material, but since it is pretty thick, its a little tough getting it on the first time. After I got it on it felt fine! I probably could've sized up and got a large if I wanted it to be a little easier. Since the sleeves are somewhat of a lace-like material, they don't have as much give as the dress does. Nonetheless, the 2nd time I put it on, it went on much smoother and wasn't a hassle. You'll feel amazing in this piece!","December 26, 2017","True to Size"

I wore this to my cousins wedding in Denver. As one other reviewer noted, you could pair any color shoe with this dress. I have a pair of blue snakeskin heels and matching clutch that worked perfectly. I could have gone with either the 8 or 10, but I chose the 10 because I am a busty girl. I also could have gone without a bra, but I wore this with a sticky strapless bra because it gave me better shape.

I would not say the dress itself was extremely flattering, the ruffles sort of hid my shape, but that could have been due to my sizing up.

Not usually one for anything with ruffles but this was perfect. One sided shoulder stayed in place all night. Fit was a solid size 0. Only warning I might give is length was a little bit on the short side when sitting down, but otherwise stayed put the rest of the night. Temperature of dress was also great! Went from warm outside to AC inside and never needed a jacket or sweater or felt too warm.","August 18, 2019","Wedding"

I am a true 4, but because I'm a 32DDD, I had to size up in this one to be able to zip it through the bust. I was able to wear just a sticky backless bra, which was great and comfortable. Since the top is so fitted, I somehow got away with that for the first time ever. A regular strapless would be fine too, but again, I didn't have much extra room through the bust. Overall, I felt pretty confident and comfortable wearing it. The color and style was easy to accessorize with fun gold drop earrings, gold clutch, and nude sandals.","July 14, 2019","Wedding"

I typically wear a 2 as I’m smaller on top, however 4 was the only size available for the date so went with it. It’s a little more form fitting than I typically go for, but not too tight or short for a wedding. It was comfortable to sit and dance in, and plenty of people asked where it was from/ complimented it. I would definitely recommend for a wedding or similar event.","June 20, 2019","Small"

I usually wear a 6 (I’m 5’4 and 132lbs, the website won’t let me update that for some reason) but sized up to an 8 because that’s all they had available. It was good because the dress runs small! The top was still a little big so I wore a strapless bra to fill out the dress, but didn’t really need it because the fabric is thick and the ruffles cover your chest. I did feel a bit naked all night! This dress is quite form fitting and shoes everything you’ve got going on!!

There was a significant sizing difference. The size 4 would not zip up completely (perfect length for 5'2"") and the size 6 was almost a little too roomy (and long) for my taste. I wore spanx to flatten out some unforgiving bumps. It has a rubber lining on the chest area, which helped it stay put. Overall a comfortable dress worn to a summer wedding.","July 15, 2019","Wedding"

The actual bust fit fine (darts where they belonged, etc.) but I wasn't able to put my shoulders back or stand up straight without it gaping and pulling at the neckline (hence the slouch in the pic).

So this dress would have worked if I was bustier and all around more shapely. I also wasn't able to wear the initial dress I rented either. Neither side I ordered fit. To my surprise, I ended up swapping dresses with a friend of mine who also rents from RTR and she fit the dress perfectly. See the photo. She is on the left wearing my rental and I am on the right wearing her rental. This dress is beautiful, unique and classy. It has this tie on the side that sets it a part from other dresses but please note if you are looking for a White Dress, it's actually more along the lines of an ivory, cream or off white than a pure white.

I did have to use some fabric tape for the hem, folded once, to be the right length with my four inch wedge heels.

Also the waist was really tight, but the butt/inseam was really dumpy. Maybe that's just because I have narrow hips (35) and a larger waist (26), but I'm pretty much a straight up size 2/XS/26 with boobs, and this just fit me weird.

I had to take the large in this skirt bc it runs very snug. (Thank u to previous reviewers) The waist was perfect for me. I'm 5'6"" and wore 3"" heels and the length was just at top of my toes. I paired with a belt bc the ribbon waist seemed unfinished for me. I bought this bc I could see it working for a number of purposes. It's extremely flattering but would be very fitted on someone who typically wears a large.","December 24, 2019","Formal Affair"

Pinched me a bit at the top. The medium was definitely too big though. I was worried it would look more unflattering in photos, but it looked just fine. Because it was a zip up and not stretchy, wasn't as comfortable to sit in. Beautiful skirt though. I'm 5'6 and wore flats. Probably could have worn a modest heel if I wanted to, though.","April 29, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW96","Ashley","It was our annual holiday work party.","Lots of compliments on the skirt. However, I almost didn’t wear it. The band was so unforgiving that I had to wear it higher than my natural waist line and I was wearing the XL. I got that squishy kind of extra pooch and even with spanx I felt like it digged in a bit to much especially for sitting. Standing it was fine. Even if I could have worn it on my natural waist line I would’ve had trouble with it dragging on the floor b/c I ended up wearing 4 inch heels.","January 20, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW96","Michelle","Easy elegance","My first RTR experience and I loved it! So easy and organized. I usually wear a size 8 or 10, and can often fit into size M. However, with this skirt, I could not even get close to zipping up the size M! So glad that you can add a backup size to your order. Size up, ladies! Size L fit comfortably. I am 5'7"" and wore 2-inch wedge heels, and the hem was a bit higher than I wanted - would've preferred it brushing/touching the floor, but it was an inch or 2 higher. I got great compliments on this skirt and it is a great price! If you have sensitive skin, just be careful - my arms got a little scratched from the sequins, but that's the risk you take when wearing sequins. Otherwise, it was very comfortable and fun to wear.","November 7, 2018","Small"

For the less formal evening event, I changed into flat booties and a knotted/cropped concert rock T-shirt.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW96","Lorena","A fabulous skirt for a fabulous evening!","I wasn't sure how wearing this skirt would go - to be honest, I'd seen other reviews from folks my size that said it wouldn't fit me, but I needed to have hope, as I was attending a gala and needed a 2-piece outfit to hide a medical device I was stuck wearing at the time. I got both the large and extra large and the XL fit like a glove. I did not try the large because of how perfectly the XL fit. As a shorty, I *did* have to wear it with 3"" heels and pulled up to just under my bra-line for correct length, but it was just perfect. It stayed put all night with no trouble, including during fairly active dancing. The only downside to wearing it like I did is that during the sitting portion of the event, some of the sequins were rubbing on bare skin over my ribs. Next time I think I'll wear some sort of light shapewear to prevent chafing from the sequins.","March 30, 2017","True to Size"

I'd say it was slightly on the smaller side only because it didn't have any give, so I definitely went with my larger back up size. Length was great, wore flats bc I wanted to be comfortable and was fine, although I could have worn heels and been fine too. The quality was amazing and it moved and sparkled beautifully.

I ordered a small and medium skirt, and ended up wearing the small as the medium skirt looked too baggy. The only issue, however, is that when zipped all the way, the waistband felt very tight and made my stomach unflattering, so I solved this problem by simply rolling the waistband of the skirt over once.

The length was slightly long for me - i was wearing 4.5"" heal, and after wearing heal, it was less that 0.5"" on the floor... So it could be just way I am standing.

It's a beautiful color and the lace detail made it unique. It was tight around my rib cage as the night went on, so I'm glad I went with the 10 (they couldn't send my backup size 8). Didn't have any issues with the lace puckering as others have mentioned. Beware that the dress is a little lower cut, so if you're looking for conservative, you might want to pick something else.","October 2, 2019","Wedding"

I felt glamorous, refined, and very comfortable in this beautiful and flattering dress. So many compliments (and zero fidgeting!!) while I danced the night away with my family. The only thing I would have changed is the strange seam in the lace around mid hip. It seemed to create a bit of a ""bump"" on each hip. It seemed to flatten out as the night progressed (or I got used to it). Also there were no snaps (lingerie straps) inside the shoulder which would have helped the dress be truly fidget-free.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TT165","RTR Customer","Beautiful dress","Great length dress for any type of wedding. Now the fit is a little weird, I am 5'5 165 pounds and curvy I fit in 8-10 depending on the clothing and I ordered an 8 and a 10. The 10 fit big around the waist and the back but felt comfortable but looked too big and the 8 fit pretty good but tight around the waist, but perfect on the back and everywhere else so I went with the 8. The dress also shows a lot more cleavage than the picture I am a 36C and with the size 8 my breast were a little squished in there, but it wasn't uncomfortable. The bottom portion of the dress slides up when you are sitting down so you have to adjust it every time you stand up and since it does that the material of the actual dress does hurt your skin making it uncomfortable to sit on. overall a beautiful dress and I would rent again!","February 24, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TT165","Jacquie","So comfy","When I first tried the dress on, I was really upset about an unfortunately placed seam that landed right at my midsection. Initially, I thought this focused attention to an area that I don't like to highlight and maybe even made it look bigger. But my fiancé took one look at it and absolutely loved it, so I decided to go with it and got tons of compliments throughout the night and ended up feeling great in it. To top it all off, it was one of the more comfortable dresses that I've ever worn.","January 25, 2019","Wedding"

Lace is a little see-through at the front but I wouldn't really call it risqué. Perhaps not the best to meet your grandparents in! But good for an informal garden party..

I ordered a back up in a size 4 because I can differ depending on the fit. I ended up wearing the 2 and loved it. It was a bit tight in the butt and thigh area for me because that's where I'm gifted. It made everything look great and very slimming. I'm a 32 C and there was just enough cleavage to look sexy but not over done. My boyfriend loved it and I got many compliments from girls as well. The 4 could have been ok but there was a lot of excess around the stomach area and it was loose in the back as well. So I felt more comfortable wearing the size 2.

I’m usually a size 8 in dresses but the size 6 fit me perfectly I think because the material is a bit stretchy.

However, I could not have fit a larger size because the waist fit to perfection. The top of the jumpsuit is difficult to fasten on your own so you'll need to buddy up for bathroom trips. The material is heavy so it very well could be worn in fall or winter. It weighs about 3lbs.","September 24, 2018","Small"

I received so many compliments and I was comfortable the entire time. No one knew it was pants until I told them too. About the outfit: it's heavier material so don't wear it if the wedding is outside or unless it's later in the season. I'm on the shorter side so the straps were way too long for me. I ended up pinning them back so that they wouldn't fall off my shoulders and then it was perfect. I went bra-less because all my strapless and backless bras could be seen from the side but it was still very comfortable and I felt supportive even with all my dancing (and during the dance off)","September 5, 2018","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN1","Alexandra","Looks like a dress, but it's a secret Romper!","I wore this outfit for New Year's Eve last year in Baltimore. I'd note that I wore a size 10R, even though I'm a regular 4R, because I was a bit heavier at the time I wore this (it's been 10 months & I'm just now writing a review). I ended up sizing up because it's a little tight in the upper body & you can feel a little bit constricted if you have a larger bust (which, I don't but have a larger rib cage). This outfit was unbelievable! I was expecting a dress but when I tried it on I realized that the ""dress"" was a perfectly designed flare romper! You couldn't tell either way once you put it on anyway! It even has concealed pockets in the front to stash your phone, money clip, etc! I had a wonderful time dancing the night away & never once felt uncomfortable.... even in the cold (well, I needed a coat because it was Maryland in January but....) because it's a heavier fabric.","November 2, 2017","Party"

The length hit around mid-shin (I'm 5'8""). The top is a bit of a hassle to get on/off, and has to be undone any time you use the restroom. Definitely worth it though!

And while I enjoyed wearing it, it probably would be better if it was actually a dress, as trying to use the bathroom requires work and help in and out of it. But the back was amazing and for an evening out, it's definitely worth it. It was extremely heavy in the hanger but felt fine on. And I loved the pockets. The only negative, the top was a little too big for me and I had no way to fix it. If I had a slightly larger bust or could somehow shorten the straps, the fit would have been perfect.","December 30, 2016","Party"

This jumpsuit is not meant for warmer climates, fortunately, the night I wore this the humidity level was low. I did not wear a bra because I am only a 32B I had enough coverage pick just the right amount of the pick-a-boo factor to provide a sexy edge. The only problem which for some can be a deal breaker, it requires someone's assistance to get in and out (I don't know how I managed to get into alone but I was determined) I had to ask a friend to accompany me to the restroom.

IMPORTANT TO NOTE: The US sizing on the website is incorrectly labeled. The 10R is labeled as US4 when it is ACTUALLY US6 per the label on the jumpsuit.

The fabric was beautiful, but a bit heavy. The ""pants"" sit very high, though overall it was very comfortable. The top part of the dress is very elegant and a bit sexy. You cannot wear a regular bra so I wore one of the stick-on ones from Victoria's Secret, though I noticed it kept falling down (and therefore so did the girls) so that was a bit uncomfortable.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN1","Amanda","RTR Team Review!","This jumpsuit is everything! The thick material and sleek silhouette make it appropriate for a more formal event. Running true to size we recommend sizing up for backup especially if you're bustier. Although there is room in the bust, the open back provides minimal support so you must go bra-less or wear a nubra. The thick material is pretty supportive and the open back is stunning! The waist fits more snug, so again sizing up is best. Hips have lots of room and the jumpsuit cut is very comfortable. Pair with strappy heels and and sleek updo to show off the entire silhouette.","March 27, 2016","True to Size"

It felt like the back was too wide or stretched out. It didn't fall nicely on my back at all and gapped at my traps making me looked like I had wings. The lace on the neck was all chewed up and also did not fall nicely. It's a pretty dress but way too worn out and should probably be retired.","September 23, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RZ58","Julia","The event was a good friend's wedding!","Overall, the dress was great for an outdoor September wedding in Seattle! It was comfortable, forgiving, and breathable (the fabric was very light). I ordered both a 4 and 6, since I didn't know what size I was going to be in a Rachel Zoe dress. I ended up wearing the 6, because even though the 4 fit, the 6 had a little bit more room. I will say that, based on the first product picture, I thought the floral applique was going to be a bit wispier, but it ended up not being the traditional lace material (probably for the best so that the dress doesn't get ruined easily). Also, as other reviews have stated, the lace in the back doesn't lay flat - but if you're standing straight, the material doesn't flop around.","September 9, 2019","True to Size"

I am 5’2 and like most designer pieces this is made for slightly taller women. The torso was too long for me, so the lace in back was bunching in a weird way. I just threw a few darts on either side to tighten up the back, and it worked perfectly, laid nice and flat. I would recommend ironing the lace in back before wearing, though. Beautiful, flattering dress. I got so many compliments!","August 18, 2019","True to Size"

The lace was a little worn looking, especially in the back, but I know this dress is a very popular rental. It had a small tear in the lace on one side (likely from someone putting their finger through the lace) but not at a seam and not at all noticeable.

It's very flattering and sexy, my husband loved it. There isn't much structure to the dress, and not a lot of stretch so make sure you order your normal size and not too small. You can only wear tape or stick ons in the front for your chest, as obviously the back doesn't allow for a bra. Also, as the other reviews mention, the lace in the back doesn't always lay flat so double sided tape might be a good option for a long night.","June 13, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM369","Jessica","Beautiful dress, sizing a little strange.","In the end, I really enjoyed this dress! It was light and flowy and everything I was looking for - I wore this for a July baby shower when I was 35 weeks pregnant, and I wanted something gorgeous that wouldn't make me hot while still covering me up, and this fit all those criteria. Overall, I was very happy with this dress. The issue I had was that I'm not sure what size of person this dress is for! The bodice over my bump was a little snug - nothing uncomfortable, not tight, just snug. However, the chest area was HUGE. If I had sized up to cover my bump, the top of the dress would literally have been falling off. Even as it was, I safety-pinned above my cleavage so my boobs weren't completely falling out. My bra size is larger than normal right now (35 weeks pregnant...) but it was still way too big! Just be aware of that when ordering. Overall, I would recommend!! Just be ready to pin the front if necessary, and maybe not the *best* option for maternity, although I made it work!","August 30, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM369","Rebecca","Beautiful and comfortable","I ordered this dress in my regular size and a size down because some reviews said the top was large. It is, but the waist isn’t. With a safety pin the top fit perfectly and I was able to wear a strapless bra. I’m 5’6 and ordered a 16 long.

This dress is an ephemeral fairytale. The details of this dress are stunning and the way it flows in the wind makes this dress so incredible. The sun rays shine through the material a little bit so be prepared to show off some leg even in a fully covered maxi. The skirt is very big so you can take some awesome shots like this and still fully be covered.

Additionally, I'm 5' 7"" and wore 3"" heels, but I was still tripping over the dress all evening.

Other annoying thing is that the bottom of the zipper is just on the lining and theres a gap in the outer layer and sometimes the lining was poking through that gap.

There was some confusion at the house where I was staying and the dress I had initially ordered was returned before I arrived. After relaying the situation to RTR, they immediately overnighted this dress and it arrived just in time for the ceremony- thank you RTR for the exceptional customer service! The 8L was a perfect length for me (I was wearing flats). You will definitely need to go braless. I was able to manage without dress tape being an extremely flat chested individual, however I really wish the straps had been adjustable and would have been more comfortable with a little more coverage. There are many layers to the skirt making it a bit toasty- especially when dancing.

The material is lovely, soft, and flows beautifully with every movement. Gorgeous colors. The dress is very long and very low cut; I had to use fashion tape in the bust area to make sure it stayed in place (though no bra or anything needed for a small chested person) and to shorten the dress so I could walk without tripping. Worked great. Received tons of compliments. I think if I had been dancing or moving a lot more, I would have been worried about tearing the dress at the bottom or about it coming open in the bust. For dinner or an event with standing and socializing, I would highly recommend, just have fashion tape on hand so you can customize the fit a bit as needed.","March 26, 2018","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM369","Mai","My baby brother got married in Las Vegas!","Overall, the dress was lovely to wear. It was light, and comfortable in the Vegas desert heat, but formal enough for me to be Best Sis/Witness/GroomsPerson at church. Since the neckline was as deep at it was, I opted to wear a simple black cami underneath and a black bolero to cover my shoulders. I also wore black strappy heeled wedges and took care with my steps, with the length of the gown and my short 5'2"" stature. My one concern with this dress is the zipper (it may have been the two dresses I just so happened to have received, but, just in case); it stuck at the black waist accent and wouldn't budge without a second person carefully nudging it through the rest of the way, as to not damage the outer fabric. But, once that was handled, it's smooth sailing! This is a beautiful dress and I'd love to wear it again, should the occasion arise.","August 24, 2017","True to Size"

The plaid is surprisingly muted and has enough color ambiguity that you'll have lots of flexibility coordinating shoes and accessories. Based on the RTR guidelines, I ordered the XL. I usually wear a 10 or 12 or L or M top. The XL was perfectly fitted in the torso and draped exactly like you see in the model photos here. I'm full hourglass and it was flattering on. Surprisingly, the cut and fabric are such that you may not need to wear a bra with this top, which is great considering that it would be a convertible one and those rarely work well.

Although I also used double sided tape because when I sat down it allowed for the fabric over the bust to loosen and allowed for the dress to be a bit more revealing.

The back and arms were tight, to the extent that I could not raise my arms to dance with my husband. It was also quite short, but this was okay with tights.

I had to reorder a 10 and 12 (shout out to RTR for getting those replacements to me QUICKLY) and the 12 was the one that fit. If you have any kind of curves or hips, you'll likely need to order 2 sizes above your normal size.

It just will not work out for you otherwise. It's very very form fitted Definitely order at least one size up or 2 sizes up especially if you are large busted or a bit muscular in the upper back because it zips to the side and you won't be able to get it on and off if you have to go to the bathroom as you have to take the sleeves end out and pull the entire pantsuit down. But it's a show stopper. I kept getting compliments all night. You will he noticed in the dress so you must feel confident to wear it. It's a spectacular bright bold pink color as you can see. It's truly a one of a kind outfit. One you can only wear once because everyone will remember you in it and will talk about you in it for days and possibly weeks on end.

The color in real life is so vibrant and the design is so interesting and very flattering. I wore it with just a pair of mid-thigh spanx under it and the thick stretchy fabric was so flattering. I also have a very long torso and because of the stretch of this fabric it still fit comfortably. It does run 1-2 sizes small, I'd normally have ordered this in a 4 if I hadn't read the other reviews, but the 6 fit perfectly. I described the vibe as if David Bowie and a flamenco dancer had a baby, this is what they'd wear. My only complaint was that the outer fabric seemed to gap a bit from the lining fabric which made some weird wrinkles in places, I was able to kind of smooth them up to a place under the ruffle so they weren't so noticeable but for a piece that would cost $1650 I'd expect it to be perfect.","January 7, 2019","Small"

Material is skin tight but does not look trashy. I would definitely size up because of how skin tight the material is. My waist is 31 inches and I usually wear a size 2 in jumpsuits, but the 4 fit like a glove on me. Did not ride up in the crotch which is a huge plus for tight jumpsuits! I wore the regular length with 3 inch heels and it was perfect for my height! Would definitely rent again and strongly recommend!","October 19, 2018","Wedding"

I read all the reviews and was VERY nervous about this fitting...even though I had ordered a size up (I fluctuate between a 6 and an 8..I went for the 6). I needed help zipping up and zipping out of this jumpsuit, but honestly it was worth it because I looked and felt AMAZING. Seriously though it is tight. Also, with the shape of my body, I did have to tape my breasts in place so that they wouldn't splay out to the sides and the jumpsuit not fit at all.

This dressssssss omg Feel like a Queen. It's so classy, sexy and just perfect. The only thing I didn't expect is that while I ordered a large based on the reviews (I wouldn've ordered a medium) the sleeves and top are extremely small. My arms aren't small. I do have issues sometimes because my breasts are very small and my arms are kind of athletic and kinda big. But I couldn't even get this dress zipped up because it wouldn't go over my arms. I went ahead with the photo shoot anyway because I loved it so much and I wasn't attending an event so it didn't matter my wings hid the zipper. But i literally could not fit into the arms so if you are thinking about this dress I would go one if not two sizes bigger.

People told me it was amazing, and I felt like a star. It was great for my rehearsal dinner. Notes: I went without a bra (34d) because I hate backless bras, and it was fine. The arms were REALLY tight, and they don't budge, so if you lift or have bigger arms, this won't work. I managed to get in, but it was so close, and you have to be careful of the lace.

Totally gross. This was my first RTR experience, and that was a huge turn off for me. I have many friends who swear by RTR though, and they said they have never had that problem. So perhaps it was a fluke? I did have to hand wash the dress myself because I absolutely could not wear it with that smell. And I will say that when I brought this to the attention of the RTR staff, they handled it amazingly and provided excellent customer service. Because of their service, I will give RTR another shot for my next event.","March 18, 2019","Formal Affair"

It's a real show-stopper with the see-through lace panels, especially the back. The lace fabric is high-quality, but as many others have mentioned it is quite tight with almost no elasticity. I followed another reviewers rec and put a rolled up towel in the sleeves for a couple days beforehand, which helped stretch them out a bit, but my range of motion was definitely limited (not ideal for dancing, bending over, lifting your arms up high, etc). I have a slim waist and wide hips, and this dress accentuated those aspects beautifully. I am a 34B and did not need to wear a bra. I would usually be a size S in dresses and went with the medium, which was definitely the right choice.

There's a panel in the front to hide the front of your bra, either wear a sticky cup type bra or if you need more support, I would suggest a strapless black bra with clear shoulder straps and know that the back of the bra can be seen, but it's pretty camouflaged by the lace.

With this dress, it's very important that the bodice fits well, otherwise the back straps and the neckline won't lay flat, also important since you really can't wear a bra. The 22 (my usual size) was far too big, I tried adjusting the 20 with fashion tape but the material has enough weight to overcome the adhesive. Having said that, I still received a ton of compliments and will definitely rent this again.","March 2, 2020","Wedding"

I have larger shoulders so I sometimes have issues but this was beyond that. It was far too tight around my neck/underarms but had tons of extra fabric on my chest that gave me weird crevasses.

It was also a bit long for my height, even with 3"" heels. I wish I had been able to get a 6R or 8R. The neck part was weirdly tight and had extra fabric around the chest, which seemed like part of the design? Anyway, once I got into it and adjusted, no one else noticed the weirdness and I got tons of compliments. I loved the fabric and the skirt.

This dress, though, was incredible. I chose it because I was avoiding wearing black YET AGAIN and wasn’t disappointed. The colors are gorgeous. I had a 14WR. Could have done a 14 but that was all they had. It was fine though, because it was SO comfortable! It wasn’t tight or stretched anywhere but I was still able to wear it without a bra. Which is perfect because I didn’t have to worry about anything showing in the cutout in the back of the dress. And it was comfy but didn’t look loose or sloppy anywhere. The material is rich and luxurious feeling without being too heavy. And POCKETS! Every girl knows how great that is. The back of the skirt came down to just above the floor with some pretty high heels and the front of the skirt is long enough that you can wear spanx or shorts underneath for extra comfort without them showing below the skirt. I recommend wearing a bold statement necklace with this dress and you will steal the show! I got so many compliments all night- I was sad to take it off!

It looked a bit frumpy from the front because you could tell it was hitting my frame a few inches too low in the hem/waist. The back was so long it was like a train (which I had to pick up when I walked to avoid dragging) which felt a bit ridiculous but did look pretty fabulous when standing still.

If it weren't for the back-lump or if the back lump was less, I would have worn it. My shape-size can lead to this issue,. Usually I can get away with keeping the extra material around my waist, but this zip was super springy, so it just created a lump towards my head. It looked worse in person, than was captured in this photo... though in the photo it, I feel like the lump accentuates my arms in a way I would not prefer. Ultimately, the way this fit me did not make me feel happy and confident, so it will be returned unworn.

Light weight silk with a poly lining- looked best with navy blue heels- black was too severe. Looked great with the Furla Lino Diva mini shoulder bag.

In a sea of solid blues, reds, and blacks, I loved the festive, floral vibe.","I was 31.5 weeks pregnant when I wore this and while it did fit, the rib cage was tight. I normally wear a 12, and there were lots of reviews from pregnant women, including third trimester, so I ordered a 12 and a 14 as a backup. BUT it's not a maternity dress per se and I have been having issues all pregnancy with items being tight in the rib cage, so I really wish I had ordered the 16 and the 14 as I am guessing that the 16 would have fit perfectly. Anyway, the dress did fit and was cute and I got tons of compliments, but I would size up 1 and 2 sizes if you're pregnant, third trimester, and you know that you don't want the dress to be too tight in the rib cage.","September 4, 2019","True to Size"

I barely noticed a difference in size, aside from the length, and the bust was a little looser, but it looked fine and fit well in the waist. It was long on me, so I wore 3"" heels.

I also don't think I have nice legs / thighs so the slit design that ran up so high along my leg/ thigh area just was not flattering on me.

But I was late to catch my train so I went with it. I ordered thinking it would be very ""Donna Paulson"" - SUITS fans know what I mean! I literally feel like I am the Carwash every time I walk. Don't feel great about wearing it to work. Also, the slits run a bit high so when I sit it is not appropriate for work. Sweater on the lap all day! If these slits were sewed up a few more inches I think this could be a hit - but as is it's a miss for me. Also using the Ladies room is problematic to say the least! Sorry TMI - but it's challenging and I think you should know! I will say for a white dress it is not see through at all which is great.","September 5, 2018","Small"

I could probably have gone bra-less because the fit was pretty snug, but I was able to fit a strapless bra underneath (bonus--because I engaged in a lot of dancing). The length was just a tad long; wore 3"" heels and could've maybe gone another inch higher in order to keep the train off the ground. Tons of compliments all night, and the BEST PART ARE THE POCKETS--I kept lipstick and my phone in them all night and they didn't fall out, and it wasn't at all obvious because the fabric is so sturdy.

The material is gorgeous and even after a 45 min ride to the church in the car I stayed wrinkle free. Plus - it has pockets !!!

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back-up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and at the hips. Curvier women should considering sizing up for full hips. It works best for A-C cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra so you should wear a strapless bra. At 4’8”, the length hit floor length on me. I love the off the shoulder neckline and overall look of this jumpsuit. It can be dressed down with sneakers or up with cute wedges.

If you're between sizes I would size up because there's not much give. I was pleasantly surprised that this worked for me and as a tall girl, that usually isn't the case with jumpsuits. Still, it wasn't the most comfortable thing to wear. You really can't raise your arms at all. And the flap at the top doesn't stay up.

The length was a little long on me but appreciated for a winter work function. I wish I had another event this weekend that I could've worn both! It was a little loose on the top but I don't think I would've gone down a size. There's enough detail in the bust area that you can wear it braless or just with sticky boob things (no way to wear a strapless bra).

This dress has two sets of zippers was a little challenging with no help to zip! I wore a cami underneath because there is a cut out in the back and I did not want that showing in church.

The intricate lace/embroidery is absolutely stunning, if you look closely you'll see little insects, butterflies, and gorgeous flowers and textures and patterns. The skirt was so fun to dance in! Being spun around makes you feel like a princess. The sleeves were the perfect 3/4 length on my arms. I'm absolutely obsessed with every tiny detail about this dress. It was semi heartbreaking to have to send it back, but I consoled myself by saying I'd rent it again one day ;) Definitely size up if you have larger boobs; I fluctuate between an A and B cup, and the 0 had kind of squished my boobs flat. The 2 was a bit more comfortable, but I got the two sizes mixed up when I was packing to leave town for the wedding. Definitely have an extra person with you to help with the zippers because they're way too complicated to do on your own. Believe me, I read comments about that and stubbornly thought that I'd be able to handle it, but I was sorely mistaken lol. Could not recommend this dress more, especially for a fall/winter event, but do be wary of the open back/snugness of the bodice","November 21, 2019","True to Size"

I did not have a bra on and felt it had good support but I'm also only 34b bra size. The slit I thought was pretty high and there is no way to cover it by the longer dress parts it is definitely made to show that leg!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP14","Emma","Amazing dress for a black tie summer wedding!","Gorgeous dress! The color is stunning in person - like the cerulean blue Crayola crayon, and the fit was super flattering. It has a lot of stretch and doesn't zip - you just slip it right on. The fabric was thick and hugs all your curves, but it was also light enough for a summer wedding or formal affair. It was great for a black tie summer wedding - fancy enough for black tie and appropriate for wedding, but with a fun pop of color for the season (late August). The chest and arms were slightly big on me, but it wasn't noticeable. I'm 5'8 and wore 3-4 inch heels, so the long length was perfect. If you're shorter than 5'7 or 5'8, I would guess the regular length would work well. The mermaid style was a little out of my comfort zone, but I'm so glad I rented it. It was really easy to dance in, and I felt great in it. Didn't hurt that it got a ton of compliments, too! Definitely recommend!","September 2, 2019","Wedding"

Color is bright orange (I originally thought it would be red). Was a great summer dress. Wore for work with a cream/gold blazer over it (back keyhole was too revealing for my office) little bit of a pain because the tie was bulky so I would untie when wearing under blazer. For dinners wore just the dress and loved it. The 0 was a little snug on my torso/chest/arms, which is true to size for me, but bustier women may find that to be an issue and want to size up.

You can kind of tell on the model that the top rides inward on her chest- which I guess on a normal person with over a large B cup means it will give you side boob (but up top where it's not as flattering). Straps are adjustable which is awesome and the middle tie is also adjustable but in the 5 minutes I had it on, it loosened up in the chest. I'm a size 6, but read another review for this designer that said she 8 was fine and this was only available in the 8- glad I sized up. This thin AF fabric shows EVERY curve from Shoulder to bottom of butt. Then your only possible saving grace is the wide leg (which is rad) but I'm 5'3"" and could have worn it with flats so makes me concerned for taller babes. Pattern is cute but might look best on a boyish/less curvy middle frame.

I found a way to pin them discreetly so they didn't fall off. I normally wear a size 8 in pants and dresses and this size 10 fit perfectly. My stomach is not the flattest but with a spanx-esque slip underneath, I felt really good. I also appreciate that the material is on the thicker side which makes it more forgiving!

Because it was so big it wasn't super flattering on me but I wore it anyway because I loved it so much. I will probably rent again in a small. For reference I am 5'1, 131 pounds, dress size small/medium, 34d, approximately 30 1/2 inches around my waist measuring across my belly button and definitely needed a small in this dress.","June 17, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JOA67","Emily","In my opinion this runs very small ....","I ordered this on a whim on two reviews that said fit true to size - well I'm always a 4/6 and can wear Smalls and mediums with that sizing so I chose the medium as I only get one size erring on the side of caution, well when I just looked at this dress out of the bag I thought I ordered wrong and got the small and I definitely thought that as I tried to try it on. I am not a big person so I don't know if I got a bad batch but this is very tight on me and I don't think I can button the bottom two buttons and sit down anywhere.... I tried to show a pic of how tight the bust is as well and I'm only a 34b sometimes a C if I've eaten good recently. But seriously this is small and the buttons pull across the tight areas. I've literally never worn a large in anything but also never rented this designer. I'm about 128 pounds and 5'4"" about 27 inch waist and 36 inch hips. This dress is adorable. But I wish it fit a little better for me to feel comfortable wearing it. I would have returned it for a different size but I was late trying my items on. The material is a light cotton which would be nice for warm weather and the sleeves are super cute but the buttons are small and like slippery I had a very difficult time getting it on, but that may be cause it's too small as well. I saw another review that agrees this runs small but then someone wore a medium that's 155 and 5'8"" with huge breasts so I just don't know what to say other than good luck because the dress is super cute.","May 1, 2019","Everyday"

When I put it on and started to button, I was thinking there was no way my massive chest was going to fit. But as I kept doing each button it closed beautifully. The medium was also bigger around the waist which is offset or not as noticeable because of the puffy sleeves. And there are pockets. This makes it a great dress for me to wear to vacation because I'll be able to eat in it. I think it's not as cute on the model because she has no hips which makes it look boxier than it is. But yes it doesn't sit flat at stomach area. Overall I would recommend this dress for sure. I am not sure if I would size up to the large. Sometimes the sizes aren't that different and a large might have fit me better or the large stomach area would have been entirely to big at that point.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM399","Vim","Great neckline!","Super cute and incredibly flattering. It was comfortable to walk, sit, and dance in. It had a slight stretch that didn't make me feel uncomfortable. I was paranoid all night that my shapewear panties were going to show because of the sheer panels in the back. No one said anything so I might have been successful? I loved the neckline and the shoulders. I would definitely rent this dress again in a heartbeat!","September 23, 2019","Wedding"

Thankfully I didn't need a bra but if I had a larger bust I'm not sure how I would have pulled it off with the open back.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM399","Sarah","Flattering and comfortable","I wore this to a formal wedding in Atlanta in June. It was 80 degrees and I stayed cool since it has an open back and is not very heavy. I usually wear a size 10, but I sized up because the hips were snug. I also have a large chest and did not have to wear a bra because of the wavy overlay hiding some of the curves. It was PERFECT! The open back got a lot of compliments. I would also wear a long dangle earring with it.","June 17, 2019","Small"

I wasn't sure what size so I ordered the 6R and 8R and went with the 8R. The 6R fit, but it was a little tight on my hips & stomach and I didn't want to feel self conscious since I knew I'd be eating a delicious meal at the wedding. It was long for my 5'4"" frame and fit perfectly with 4"" heels. It was glamorous and tasteful with a hint of sexy (thanks to the sheer back).

Both ended up being too short - like way short. I called RTR with only 3 days before the event and was told ""we are going to make you happy!"" That day, I was shipped over-night two additional dresses. I ended up wearing this one only because the other back-up was way too big. It's a basic black dress, that I wanted to avoid as I was in a sea of black dresses, but my husband loved it and I received numerous compliments. The back is the sexiest part and to me made the whole dress an A+ as far as black dresses go.","February 27, 2019","True to Size"

I'm 5'8 and wore heels so the dress skimmed the ground barely and didn't drag on it. I felt very elegant at a black tie wedding. The dress itself was easy to zip up in the back but the button closure for the mesh overlay was a bit difficult to get by myself. Maybe have someone help you to get it done quicker. But definitely not a con. I wore this dress for 12 hours and was comfortable the entire time. Would definitely rent it again.","January 30, 2019","Wedding"

I didn't end up wearing it since I had a better alternative from RtR for the wedding, but it was my runner up. There is actually a bit of mesh on the waist which adds a bit of sexy. The only weird thing about the fit is getting the neck/collar part to lay flat at the top. I would have been fidgeting with it most likely.","January 23, 2019","True to Size"

The amount of material is dramatic, the material is shiny, polyester shiny,and VERY stiff, so no draping at all. The next layer is an actual scratchy net, old fashioned ""crinoline"" that makes the dress pouf way out,and made me look like a 56 yr old pregnant woman. Then there is a slip layer that is of way too tight polyester. I could not get it off fast enough.

I read the reviews and compared my size/weight to those who had reviewed (thanks ladies!) and determined 2 would probably be my best bet. I am not very busty, if you are, may need to go up a size. Highlights: POCKETS! The hip pockets were so roomy, my friend was joking they were like a clown car cos I just kept pulling more stuff out of them! I could actually get cell phone in one (though have to be careful when you sit it might pop out) keys, lip gloss and credit cards in the other for shopping. With the skirt being so full it didn't look too bulky with all of the items I had squirreled away. The buttons on front are decorative so no gaping - yay! It was a little low cut, but I just used my lowest cut standard bra. I didn't have trouble with straps falling down except when I sat in the car so no biggie. Fully lined and I did not find it too hot here in SW Florida on record setting hot days.

I loved the full skirt and it is nicely lined so it felt almost like a crinoline. Always thrilled to have pockets, too!","October 6, 2019","Wedding"

As a short person I struggle with garments this length, but this one was amazing! The top of the dress is another story. It's super cute, but as others have said, this dress runs super large in the top. It definitely had extra room on me. I wore it over a white button down and pinned the dress' straps to my shirt so they'd stay put (it was too big otherwise, and I was wearing it to work so didn't want it to be too revealing). I loved the way it felt, but wouldn't buy it bc of the sizing issues. The waist fit me perfectly, but I have a slightly larger waist compared to the rest of my body, so others will likely find it large in the waist as well.","July 19, 2019","Large"

However, I did have to wear 4 inch heels so it wouldn't drag on the ground. Another plus about the dress is the adjustable straps and waist tie. It gives you the ability to tailor it to your body. The color is awesome. It would work with any skin tone. I wore this to a black tie wedding at a banquet hall. Would not suggest this dress for a church wedding because of all the skin showing in the back and the slit on the leg. You wouldn't be able to wear Spanx or a regular bra with this. I wore breast petals. The dress was wrinkled when I received it. Therefore I had to iron it but wasn't too difficult. I received lots of compliments throughout the night!","June 5, 2019","Wedding"

It's not very forgiving, but I found it incredibly flattering and confidence-boosting. The fabric was heavier than I expected, which was helpful for a smoother look. I chose to go bra-less and felt fine about the cutouts. It helped that my torso is a bit shorter than the dress was designed for, so it had a natural ruching camouflage around my abdomen. 5'6"" and wore 2.5"" wedges, had no issues with hem length.

I was definitely the only person at the event in a dress this color so if you're into standing out, this dress is for you. Lengthwise, I'm 5'8 and wore 3 inch heels with the long version of the dress which was perfect, but if I had worn flats the regular length would have exactly right. In terms of fit, being able to adjust the straps and the tightness of the bow was super helpful in getting the top part to fit, so I would say order size based on lower half. I was worried about the amount of skin showing at first but I didn't feel like the cut outs were too revealing.

The color on this dress is SO beautiful. It's definitely not very forgiving, but that's bc it's a slinkier style dress, which is fine. I just did a lot of sucking in.

Even though RTR's pic makes it look like a light pink, I have to agree with other reviewers that it's really more of a fuchsia. Definitely a bold dress! I wore the 6R, which fit me very well. I'm 5'6"" and wore kitten heels with the dress - if the heels had been much taller, I would have needed to get the 6L. I will say, this dress is not for the faint of heart - it's an attention-getting color, and because of the cutouts, it's difficult to wear a bra or any shapewear with.

The bow must be secure, or the dress design will fall off. I am 5'5 so length wise I did have to hold the fabric a lot walking around. It was still a fun dress, and I loved the sexy sides on top of the open bow back!! If you love bright purple you will not be disappointed.

The only downfall is that the material is fairly thin so I was a little self-conscious about my cellulite showing through (you def can't wear Spanx) but I decided to channel my inner self-confident goddess and embrace it ;) It's all about the body positivity, ladies!","September 24, 2018","True to Size"

I wore it to an investor lunch, brunch, happy hour, work, vacation in Italy, running errands around town, etc. This is a versatile dress that looks so good paired with heels and a blazer to dress it up, or sneakers and a t-shirt for a fun, casual look. I love the slit up the front, it's enough to give it an edge but not so high up that it's inappropriate for the work place. The material feels silky & high quality. True to size, although it's a little tight in the chest; if you are busty I would size up. Very flattering dress! It hugs at the waist but loosens up around the stomach so no need to worry if your stomach is your problem area, this dress hides it well. The back is also super fun, & you can definitely wear a bra with this dress if preferred. Pictures do not do it justice, I will be purchasing!","September 7, 2019","True to Size"

Lots of compliments even though I dressed it down with sandals. It's cut straight but the slits add some flow if you have a stomach so it's not totally tight just a very smooth silhouette.

A little more snug in the crotch than other jumpsuits I've rented, which I assume means this may not be good for longer torsos. My torso is neither long nor short.

Because I was wearing a size too small, I got some boob wings on the fabric and had to use fashion tape to keep them in check.

Awesome because it has the look of a dress but you can move around more because it's a jumpsuit. Got compliments from strangers! I didn't give it 5 stars because as you tighten the top, the torso gets pulled up at the crotch area (not enjoyable) so I was checking the straps a lot.

Threw on heels for dinner. Unfortunately , romper straps are sewn. U tie them in back, but don't adjust like triangle top bikini. Had to use safety pins under arms and on straps to make outfit work.

I usually wear a 6/8 and the 10 fit but was tight. You will need a buddy to zip you, it's a really tough zipper. I appreciated this dress because you can wear a normal bra with it-score! The lace looked great and was high quality. There were flowers that kind of stuck out, which I kept going back and forth on whether I liked them or not. Definitely a unique dress.","January 23, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP14","Shay","Did Not Work For My Body Type","I rented this dress for my birthday dinner in San Francisco. Sadly it did not work for my body type at all. The first thing I noticed, when I opened the this dres is that the shoulder pads are huge in it. Seriously huge like 80s huge. I felt a little like a linebacker wearing it. The next thing I noticed is that there are zippers for some reason on both of the arms, I'm not quite sure why they exist, but they were really uncomfortable on and dug into my skin. The next thing that didn't work for me what is the neckline being so hi, it rubbed against my neck and created a bright red rash, not a good look at all. Lastly, the dress did not work with my rear end at all. I have a little bit of a bigger rear than most, and this dress hit it in all the wrong places. It flared out right as my rear end, making me feel exposed and trying to pull it down constantly. Some pros about this dress I thought it's made of really warm high quality fabric that feels quite luxurious. The open back was absolutely beautiful and the lace was in perfect condition and really stunning. Ultimately, I think if I was a slightly different body type and enjoyed the bold shoulder look more, this look might have work for me but sadly it was a no and I went with another option. For reference I am 5'8, Dress size 2, Jean Size 27.","May 3, 2018","Party"

They were subtle and just added structure to the shape. I have fairly narrow frame and shoulders so this looked fine on my body type. The open back and side peekaboo meant no bra which was very doable because of the cut and thickness of material. I did use athletic tape to tape my boobs so they would land closer together than they do naturally because I did not want any side-boob since this was a work event.

I got compliments all night and it was so swingy when I was dancing. 10/10 would rent again","February 27, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JS33","Missy","The pockets are a HUGE PLUS. Got more compliments on the pockets from men than I did women, lol.","Fit - would have been perfect if not for the bust area. I debated including the 2nd pic because of the embarrassing way my boobs are being pulled down (this is not the way my cleavage looks in fits), but it's a good warning for reference if you have a similar problem with dresses fitting great everywhere but your bust/upper back. (That cut is from fashion tape that moved around all day) I have broad shoulders and a (slightly) above average size chest area, so getting the dress pulled as far up as I needed first was a challenge. A 6 would be slipping and too big, but the 4 was just tight enough in my upper back that I had problems keeping it all the way up on my chest because it would threaten to slip down! Wish there was a size in between 4 & 6. CONS - The dress lasted me 12 hours of wear, but after a solid 8 hours, the last 4 were a struggle with fashion tape moving around and not sticky anymore. During the reception I had to keep subtly pulling it up my chest as I walked around because of the heavy material pulling down, and I didn't want low cut cleavage showing. By the end of the night when the tape had given out, my boyfriend was even helping me keep it from pulling down while we danced! We were drunk and turned this into a funny game on the dance floor, but I would NOT recommend risking this fit if you have the awkward bust problem with formal dresses. I rented a 2 as my backup because I read a lot of reviews saying to size down, but I don't recommend sizing down if you're a bit more top heavy. PROS - All that said, the dress is beautiful and the thick material was perfect for attending a formal winter wedding in Chicago. It's elegant and subdued color, which I think is perfect for wedding guest. I felt very pretty, tea length was perfect, and I'm 5'8 and have long legs. Overall, would recommend but consider the dress being strapless and heavy material before choosing a size.","February 20, 2020","Small"

It's a slightly heavier material - just something to keep in mind if you're attending an outdoor summer wedding. Really lovely fit overall, it has pockets which are cool, and the length was perfect for me (technically it's tea length but it fit me like a full length dress - didn't have to worry about any part of the dress dragging on the floor, etc.)","August 2, 2019","True to Size"

The top didn't have enough structure to wear without a bra. I tried wearing it with a strapless bra, but it felt too bulky and I still kept having to pull it up. I am a 32D and rarely have this problem with strapless dresses. The dress is very heavy, so perhaps that was part of the problem. I was planning on wearing it to a wedding, but there was no way I could have danced in it without having to adjust it every minute. Also, the dress was a bit too long. I am 5'4"" and it wasn't quite tea length on me.","July 3, 2019","Large"

It was tight up top which sort of flattened/squished the chest area (not for a larger-chested girl), which was ok since the fabric was so heavy I don't know that the dress would have stayed up otherwise.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AGST3","Rachael","This dress is 10000% me","Looooove this dress! Perfect for summer, and could be transitional to fall, and here is why/what you need to know: I have a wider rib cage and wear 34B, so after reading reviews about how tight it was in the rib cage, I decided to size up (I'm usually size 8 and went with size 10): even though my breasts don't fill out the chest area, the pattern and colors made it appropriate to wear without a bra. There is a hidden clasp in the front to pull the chest area in just a bit more, or leave it unclasped for an even deeper v in the front. I decided to clasp it. This worked for me, perhaps because I also have broad shoulders so that helped to make the chest area seem less big. I wore this dress while riding my motorcycle (I know, not proper riding gear) from Brooklyn into Manhattan and I didn't flash anyone, so yay :) I paired with gray huarache mules (wore boots while riding and then changed) and received lots of compliments on the dress. Colors are gorgeous!! The dress is the perfect length and the material is lightweight to make a 90 degree day bearable! To transition into fall, I'd pair this dress with black leather boots and a leather jacket.

This dress was a standout and I was so happy with it. I wish the photo showed the dress more clearly--in person it was better! The fabric was a heavy crepe jersey, but a good quality jersey that arrived with no wrinkles. This one travels and wears well--which in my case was good because it didn't arrive till about 2 hours before I had to wear it (UPS problems...) The fit was definitely a close, fitted one. In fact, at was I was really nervous I was not going to be able to zip it! I switched out a padded (strapless) bra for silicone breast cups and pulled on a pair of Spanx and after much gymnastics, finally got the zipper up. If I had had someone to zip me up from behind, this probably have gone more smoothly! It was a 2 person job for sure. That being said, once it was on and finally zipped, to my great surprise it did not feel tight. In fact, it felt very comfortable all night. The leg slit was sexy, yet discreet at the same time. I was able to sit and not have the fabric splayed out everywhere. I normally wear a 6-8. This one fit me (just) in the 8.","September 14, 2019","Formal Affair"

Running true to size with a lot of stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back-up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and at the hips. It works best for A-C cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a NuBra or strapless bra since it is off-the-shoulders. At 4’8”, the length hit just above the knee on me. The slit sleeves and off-shoulder-neckline give this classic LBD some edge.

It's stretchy which is great and I will order again for a fire night...my husband requested to see this one again!","December 11, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMU160","Jennifer","Beautiful and comfy!","This dress was really pretty, but super comfy, too. And even though it is an off-the-shoulder dress, it didn't ride up or slip off (even while dancing)!","November 21, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMU160","Gen","Very fitting and short on tall girls","Wasn't sure this would work and My instincts were right... it's very fitting and short. Being 5'9"" with a few curves I did not feel comfortable wearing this to a work event. If you're straight and narrower and looking for a sexy LBD this is for you.","November 13, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW821","Holly","Very soft and comfy! Love the shoulder cut and the boning on the chest slit.","Loved the softness and comfortability of the fabric, but this didn't really strike me as designer quality. It's not a super high end piece, so it's great for any occasion really. What's keeping me from eating this 5 stars is the way it accentuated my tummy. Really no forgiveness with this material, and everything showed. Also a thread was loose on the waist stitching and I had to cut it off. Would look great on someone a tad taller and slimmer.","February 20, 2020","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW821","Mary","Comfortable and cute!","The fit was really comfortable, especially since it was pull-on with no buttons or zippers. I styled it with a loose sweater and belt for a party and got a ton of compliments. I got even more when I showed off that it was a jumpsuit and not just pants!","December 9, 2019","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW821","Rukiya","Loved it so much I bought it!","This is perfect for the office and beyond. I work in a corporate setting so I wore with a bright red blazer to work. I met a guy for happy hour after work and then went to the club with some girlfriends. It's a perfect transition outfit and without the blazer I felt sexy! I didn't pronounce tummy and with spanx it would've even been better. Love it and fits true to size.","October 26, 2019","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW821","Kelly","So comfortable!!","The material feels like loungewear but it looks completely polished and professional. I wore this to work two days in a row (different offices, different people), got lots of compliments both days, and was as comfortable as if I was wearing PJs. There's no zipper, you just pull the whole thing on and off. Bathroom trips were easier than other jumpsuits I've worn. Highly recommend!","September 26, 2019","Work"
