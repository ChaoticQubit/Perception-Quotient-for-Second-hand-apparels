"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/GRJ44","Mandy","Too small, didn't wear","This was really cute but I was not able to wear it. I usually wear a medium quite comfortably but this was too tiny. I couldn't get it on properly. It was way too tight around the rib cage, and it was much more of a crop cut than I expected, so it showed more belly that I was willing to show, plus it was so tight that it cinched the midriff in a very unflattering way.","November 4, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/GRJ55","RTR Customer","Dinner date with the girls, girls night!","This dress felt amazing to wear, although I think I should have worn the 4. I enjoyed it on me, but I don't think it is very photogenic. I don't think it really captured how it truly fit me in reality.","March 7, 2020","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/GRJ55","Emily","Unique dress for Baptism","The dress was a lovely silky material. I was looking for something appropriate for my son's winter baptism. The dress was a bit too low cut for my liking and was not easy to pin shut because of the silky material. I'm usually a size 6, but easily wore the 4 and could have possibly even sized down to a 2. Overall I liked the dress and it was a reasonable price but not sure I'd ever have a reason to rent again.","January 23, 2020","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/GRJ55","Leah","Wore to the ballet","The dress is pretty fabric and nice quality, but ultimately was not my favorite because it was a bit robe-like with the wrap style front and the pattern. I ended it up wearing it though, so it's not terrible, just not my fav. For reference, I am 5'4"" 118lbs, 32 A, petite frame. When I would sit down with the dress on, the chest would gape open where the fabric crosses. Luckily I have a maroon slip from another dress that matched perfectly, so I had to wear that underneath or else my entire chest would be exposed! But I always have this issue with dresses that have a wrap-type of bodice. If you have that issue usually, then expect that with this dress. Otherwise, the length was a bit long for me, but with some high heels, it worked. Overall, the fabric itself is pretty, it's nice quality, but I wouldn't rent it again.","January 5, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/GRJ55","RTR Customer","Wanted this to work so badly - beautiful material, bust fit WAY off!","I rented this for a ""warm and cozy winter wedding"" - the fabric is a bit shiny, a little heavy, and higher quality than I was expecting, so big points there. There is a strange seam that hits across the hips and stomach - looked terrible in the 14 because it accentuated my ""hip dip"", but wasn't a problem in the 12 as the length was right (fit me like a glove from ribcage down). However, there is so much extra material at the bust that I couldn't even modify this to work as it is a faux wrap - it wasn't just a lot of cleavage, it flopped open to show my entire bra and both of the girls. Pinning across just looked lumpy, and wearing a cami underneath took it way too conservative and just looked like I was making up for a dress that didn't fit rather than something open and flowy. It needed to be taken in at the shoulders by about an inch (too much material to pin there too, but man, if I could have gotten that alteration done it would have been a fabulous dress). Might work for someone with a longer torso or more sophisticated boob taping skills - I'm so sad this one was unwearable for me :(","January 3, 2020","Large"

The only reason why I knocked off a star is because as the night progressed a feel like the dress got even bigger. It was a tad big when I tried it on but the small was already taken. As the night when on I felt like it stretched out more. Even with all that I'm so glad I wore it and would totally rent it again! I received so many compliments and it was very comfortable.

It speaks for itself, but I can add that it is super-comfortable. The slit is serious, which offsets the classic sheath line and mid-calf length. I'm 5/3, 41-31-36 with a bit of a tummy, but this was super-flattering if my husband and all the many compliments are to be believed. The sequins did not scratch or shed. They are the softer kind that you can shade a bit with your hand. I picked the red shoes because it was a holiday party, but for a different occasion I would have chosen more neutral shoes. I would definitely wear this again, with a different crowd. It is MEMORABLE and a showstopper.","December 23, 2019","True to Size"

For perspective, I'm a 34B in bra size but have slightly larger hips, and I think this brought too much attention to the width of my hips (if that makes sense)!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CARC5","Carly","Very pretty & flowing","I enjoyed wearing this dress a couple of times, once out to dinner with friends and another time for a catered dinner party with 3 other couples at my home. It was casual enough to not feel over-the top, given the fabric, but it was still dressy too. It is comfortable. I would say it runs large not because it's actually large, but because it's forgiving. It could have fit someone heavier and bigger than me because the waist and shoulder areas are stretchy, and the skit is extremely full through the hips and below. You're not going to run the risk of it being tight, so I would size down. I wore it with the highest heeled shoes I could find. If you're shorter than me- 5'6""- you should probably stay away. It is very long! I had to be careful not to step on the skirt- even with heels it is FLOOR length! This would probably be a fabulous dress for someone 5'9"" or taller!","December 20, 2019","Large"

The only downside is that there is no stretch or give. I ended up sizing up two sizes so my hips and butt would fit comfortably since I'm much curvier on my bottom.

There is no slit so you are a little limited. Enough to walk up steps but if you want to get down on the dance floor it may restrict your moves a bit. I was worried about it fitting me as typically this type of cut tends to be snug in the hips but big on top. It was really fitted in the hips with the 4 but it was ok. I was little confused about my return date being a Sunday as all the UPS stores were closed in my area. I tried to call but was on hold. I did find in the faq's that if you have a return date on a Sunday And there is not a drop off , you can return the following day by noon.

The embroidery is so expensive looking and especially the netting detail. I chose to style it with a body suit and sheer socks for a little something different which really made it shine.

The dress has aspects that are a pain and make it not worth the hassle. The belt is sewn on to the back of the dress so it is not optional. The silky fabric makes the bow sag to the middle of the stomach. I had to pin it in place so it would stay up. The neckline has a slit that you can't see on the stock photo. The slit gaps open so I had to pin that as well. Even with the pinning, the neckline still gapped at times so I had to be conscious of sitting up straight so my bra wouldn't show. I also have a very small chest. This dress wouldn't work for anyone with a larger chest since the gap would be very exposing and show your bra.","June 30, 2019","Wedding"

The cut ruins what could be a lovely work dress. After getting over my initial annoyance, I decided to get crafty with fashion tape but that didn't work either.

It works perfectly, it will keep you covered up for the office, and the little pop off black with partial skin sticking out of the keyhole looks gorgeous, sexy, and classy. Just enough to cover you up, while still maintaining a slight peek-a-boo effect. If you don't have one, spend $20 on a black spandex camisole style slip via Amazon prime, and rent this dress immediately. I styled it with a wide brimmed cream & black fedora, with tan cap toed cream snakeskin pumps.... I looked and felt like I stepped out of a Cuban luxury photo shoot.","July 17, 2019","Work"

I wore this to a bridal shower, on a date, and during the day at a farmer's market/brewery while exploring a new city and it was perfect for each of those locations.

Also you must wear a shirt underneath this for sure, and the whole thing shifted around way too much to not drive me crazy! I could tell from the photos that it was cropped, but it was not a flattering length for me-- and the movement of the piece meant it rode up even further to make the neck even more floppy.... kind of a nightmare, but maybe just not meant for a curvy hourglass shape.","September 10, 2019","True to Size"

All day long people were stopping me to complement the dress, even people I didn't know! I am usually between an 8-10, as sometimes things don't fit my hips. But this dress fit perfect! At first it seemed a little tight around the arms/chest and I thought I wouldn't have full range of motion. However, it didn't bother me at all. I was even able to reach all around to straighten my hair wearing it. Something that may not be noticeable in pictures: It looks black with green leaves and pink flowers. However the dress is actually a DARK GREEN, with green leaves, and pink flowers. This was something I really liked about it, but if you are looking for a black dress, this is not the one.","January 28, 2020","True to Size"

It was a gorgeous dress but makes me horrified for inclusive sizing that is absolutely not inclusive- makes me not like Veronica Beard, I've rented Veronica Beard blazers and they run pretty true to size so really confused about the dress. In short- rent this dress 2 sizes up if you want it properly sized and 3 sizes up if you want it roomy. And if indeed you wear a size bigger than a 12- I am so sorry- this brand thinks you like to feel shamed and fit one leg into their clothing allegedly in your size.","September 1, 2019","Party"

The size was perfect and the fit was good, but there's just something about this dress I didn't like. If you wear it buttoned up all the way at the neck, you look very bulky in the chest/shoulders. When I opened up the buttons at the neck it was ok, but I still didn't love it. It's kind of gothic/Victorian/old fashioned doll, which wasn't what I wanted. But if you're into that, it's cute. A little short too.","February 21, 2020","Party"

I'm a 10/12 and I fit into both the medium and large. This dress MUST be steamed before wearing because it arrives crumply, which makes the underskirt ride up and the overskirt too short. The zippers on this dress are really cheap, in fact one on the dress I wanted to wear was broken so I sized down. The material is gauzey and more of an off white than a true white. The embroidery is gorgeous. You need a plunge backless bra as there is an open slot down the back and the front V is too low for a normal strapless bra. You could also go without a bra if you are comfortable. I got so many compliments on this dress and it would work well for a casual day dress or a not too formal evening dress.","September 7, 2019","True to Size"

Pros - really cute material and super comfortable. It is very short (I'm 5'10"") so wore with flats as we were walking a few blocks to dinner anyways. I loved the area under the bust that has cut outs. I'm super pale so I just looked like it was my skin. Lol. But wanted to point it out in case others not into cut outs. Cons - I am a size 4 on top and 6 on bottom and the hips fit me perfectly in a size M. I have a very small rib cage and this fit me perfectly which means it runs smaller than normal! The bust area is very low cut. I am a 36C so it actually didn't pucker on me but I had to pin it at the bottom of the v (I wasn't wearing a bra since the only one I had packed wasn't low enough for the dress).

I love the scallop and the cutouts but unfortunately, it was just a bit blah for me. A medium might have been better but I'm not sure if that would've fixed the neck issue either.

The only other alternative would be to wear a cami underneath. I think even if you have a smaller chest you would still have to use double sided tape. I had to return it!","April 23, 2019","Party"

I liked it in front as I found it too plain without the front bow. It’s a great, basic dress, covers you up but is cool - perfect for a spring vacation in a city which is what I got it for. Very flattering because the tie can be made snug to show off the waist - my bag is rumpling the dress on the side in my picture making it look lumpy but it is super flattering.

I ordered a size 6 bc it was the only one available but I think I could've worn a 4 but because of the tie in the front, the 6 wasn't an issue for me at all. I think the tie lets it be flexible in sizing if they're out of your size. I paired it with pink kitten heels and it worked perfectly. It was effortlessly chic and very comfortable. It's very flattering and a great length. It doesn't look quite right in flats but heels look fabulous with it. It also isn't sheer either which was a relief.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going down for your back-up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection with comfortable room at the hips. It works great for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a NuBra or strapless bra since it has a low neckline. At 4’8”, the length hit floor length on me and was sadly too long for me. I really wanted to love this dress, however, I found the bell sleeves to be overwhelming for my petite frame. The material is somewhat sheer so I highly recommend wearing a nude slip underneath. Overall this is a great summer look! Pair with wedges and a layered necklace to complete your outfit.","March 23, 2019","Large"

I wish it was cut a little narrower in the rib cage. It didn't need to hug my body, but it was too shapeless to be particularly flattering. If you carry weight in your mid-section this would likely cover it nicely. I got lots of compliments and this can be dressed up or down. With jeans like the model or a pair of dressy palazzo pants or skirt. Lots of colors would match, black, navy, burgundy, light blue, and more.

I wore boob tape, but you don't necessarily have to. Because the plunging neck line goes so far down, you cannot wear high-waisted shapewear because it will show thru. I wore a mid-waisted shaper thong but you don't necessarily need to wear shapewear with this dress either. It's great. Classic black velvet with a classic sexy vibe.","December 15, 2019","Party"

Other renters note the buttons--yes there are tiny buttons up the back of this dress but it is not necessary to unbutton all of them to get this dress on as it does have a hidden zipper. The bust is small so I didn't wear a bra. If you have a more average or larger sized bust, definitely size up.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FP164","RTR Customer","Sexy and classy, all in one!","While the dress runs true to size, the fit is a bit snug right under the chest. I found this to be flattering because it accentuates a narrow waist before becoming more lose on the hips -- perfect for someone that has a wider bottom, like me! Perhaps the only problem I found is that the dress tends to ride up so slightly, so I had to be conscious of this when I sat down. The material is super soft and the dress can be worn to both semi-formal and formal occasions depending on the shoes and accessories you pair it with. The buttons on the back look very elegant, although they can be frustrating to get through without help. Overall, flattering in the right places. Sexy, cute and classy while keeping it comfortable.

CONS: Due to people stepping into the pants previously, the top was larger than it should've been. The hook and eye at the top of the back did not stay connected, it came loose multiple times causing the chest and cleavage area to enlarge.

I received so many compliments all night long!","So as many of the reviews have stated, the waist band is pretty tight. Although I said the dress ""fits small"" it was really only the waistband. In fact, when I tried on my size-up back-up dress the other parts of the dress seemed too big, even though the waist felt more comfortable. It wasn't tight enough to ruin my night... but a big meal or any bloating could have changed that. I wore a strapless black bra with this dress and did not have issues with the bra showing in the back. The front is actually kind of low cut, but the lace hid/meshed in with the black bra really well. The only other issue was the zipper was very hard to close and not because it was too tight. Not sure why that happens but it got stuck and I felt nervous I might break it. Overall, I really loved this dress and am so happy I rented it! I was sad to send it back!","February 9, 2020","Small"

It was true to size as well. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 is because my husband had a hard time zipping me into it, and not because it was too tight--the zipper itself seemed to be of poor quality.

This was my first rental with RTR and it was such a great experience!","October 24, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CD52","C","Five stars despite the annoying zipper!","I loved this dress! At the time of the affair I was probably around 151 pounds. I'm usually an 8, but sometimes a 6, sometimes a 10, depending on the brand. The 8 fit great. The shoulders slipped a little and the zipper was hard to zip, but I loved this classy, unique dress. I got loads of compliments.","October 23, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CD52","Lauren","This dress was magical to wear! Received so many compliments and felt amazing in it!!","I normally wear a size 4, but was able to wear a 2, probably could have gone either way, but the chest area was a little too big on the 4. I will say the zipper catches and is difficult to zip. I needed a few people to help me, but we got it zipped :)","October 22, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CD52","Lauren","Very flattering","The lace v does go down quite low so I used an adhesive bra, but could have gotten away without anything probably as the dress has good support on its own. As others have said, the zipper is very stubborn. I had to run a pencil down the zipper to get it to go up and down a bit easier. Other than that the entire dress was fantastic. Very elegant, not too flashy but special and flattering on pear shape!","October 18, 2019","Formal Affair"

The fabric was gorgeous, nicely weighted but not heavy. I wore it to an outdoor wedding and the evening was cool - the dress is elegant, perfect for a wedding. Numerous compliments all night long! Literally! Catherine Dean designs beautiful gowns - I would rent another in a heartbeat. Note that the zipper IS tricky as others have mentioned. It was frustrating - I had to enlist a girlfriend to get it zipped.","October 9, 2019","Wedding"

I didn't have an issue with this. I preferred it to be tight. I like my dresses to have give below the waist for extra food :) I had plenty of compliments all night and really enjoyed its vintage flair. It is a gold and black dress but honestly even in person I think it comes off more metallic olive green and black than gold. I was fine with it though. Watch your heels in this dress as the pretty fabric can get caught if you aren't careful.","September 16, 2019","Wedding"

Built in bra is very comfortable and supportive. The difficulty with the dress is that the zipper is extremely difficult to zip in the area where the black belt is. Don't rent this if you don't have anyone to zip the dress for you. The shoulders were a bit loose and tended to slip a little bit.

The only reason I gave this dress 1 4 star and not 5 star was because it has a lot of 'shiny' thread throughout it, which I did not realize, nor can you tell from the pic.

The fabric is lightweight, but feels sturdy and expensive, while also not wrinkling easily. I wore with white tennis shoes to dress it down.

Luckily I had a few straight pins from my husbands new shirt or I wouldn't have been able to wear this one. I was able to pin the straps in the back to make it perfect.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MH31","Grace","Stand out in the crowd","This bright and cheery dress was great. The material is more of a thick linen, better for a daytime affair. My only issue with the dress was the straps were a tiny bit too long on me. Still fit but had I bought it I would have had them tailored. My MAJOR issue with Rent the Runway is their delivery service in NYC. They say delivery by 8 pm but use a 3rd party service and only when I called at 8:30 pm do they mention that actually, they deliver until 10 pm. I was also told I would get a text just before delivery and upon delivery. I didn't get either. The lack of communication is terrible and is not my first time having this issue. On a past rental, I waited around my office for the supposed 8 pm delivery only to never get it because ""they don't deliver to offices that late"". I was told I would be top priority the next morning. I had to leave for the weekend at noon and did so without my dresses. I called and cancelled. At 6 pm, I got a call from the delivery service that my rental had arrived. I told the delivery man than I was not there, I had cancelled my order. He asked me ""What am I supposed to do now? Go back downtown?"" Not. My. Problem. Anyway, this dress was my attempt to give RTR a second chance but they didn't impress me. Until they can have clear communication and a reliable delivery service, this will be my last order.","September 12, 2018","Large"

I have worn it once a week or more for the past couple of months, and I am planning to make it a permanent part of my closet. It is linen so it does wrinkle but I don't mind steaming it! The tie on the front of the dress allows you to easily adjust the top to fit your bust. However, if you have a larger chest, it is definitely a bit revealing. I imagine you could size up but then I fear the bottom might be too large.

Typically wearing a 2 and analyzing the material, I thought that would be the best option. It came in and was very oversized so I sent it back and waited for it to become available in a size XS so I could rent it for a wedding at the end of the month. Unfortunately, the size XS came in and still was oversized on the left arm. It fit everywhere else but was unwearable as-is and the shoulder pad would not stay in place or sit correctly (maybe I have skinny shoulders, idk??). At the end of the day, I wanted to make this dress work so badly it just didn't. I wouldn't recommend it for a wedding like I was trying to wear it for, but if you're in need of a dress for a 80s Prom style social, I'd give it a try.","September 19, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CS84","Emily","Woah","This dress, clearly, is a standout. The color is something you really don't see especially in a formal dress which I would consider this mostly because of the fit and flare at the bottom. The 4 fit perfectly and the material is a dream silky and smooth with a little stretch to it as I was on vacation and eating more than usual but it still fit and was pretty comfortable. This was a backup dress and I ended up going with my first choice to the main formal event but wanted to wear this very much as it was such a statement piece and I'd never worn anything like it. My husband loved it and convinced me to wear it to brunch but that to me definitely ended up feeling like an inappropriate occasion and I was super overdressed. But the dress is still fabulous. Only lost a star because the flare at the bottom is a little awkward in my opinion. I'm 5'4"" and have about 3.5"" heels on and the back of the dress barely missed the ground. I did not wear a bra and have 34b/c bra size. The straps are adjustable and have a cute but not that noticeable leopard print. I was about 130 pounds at this point approx 28 inch waist 36 inch hips.","May 28, 2019","Date"

Fabric is thick and seems very high quality. While it's very form fitting, because of the quality of fabric, it's fairly forgiving (although I did have on Spanx underneath). Another review noted the back touched the ground, I didn't have a problem with that although I'm 5'9 and wore 3-4 inch heels.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LMT1","Rachelle","HORRENDOUS. PICK A DIFFERENT DRESS.","I'm not sure who it is for. I'm 5'2"" and it was VERY short on me. The waist hits far too low to accentuate my thinnest point, making me look extremely wide. Its already a very voluminous dress with the fabric and pleating, so this was not at all flattering. I'm a 32 DDD at Victoria's Secret and my bust did not fit quite right in the dress. The space for the boobies was just way too large to accommodate an actual human being shape. I even tried criss-crossing the straps in the back to see if that would help. It did not. I opted to wear a friends dress, a size 12, which was better than wearing this dress. I'm not sure what kind of body type this dress if for: if you are tall, it will be too short; if you aren't busty, it will be baggy; if you are looking for a dress to give you an hourglass shape, this will hit you in all the wrong places. I'd HIGHLY advise picking a different dress unless you'd like to look like an ugly cake topper.","May 22, 2019","Small"

The dress is pretty low cut but classy. I''m a 34 C and could fill out the top without adding cups or any tape for security.

I'm busty with a small waist and normally styles like this look great on me, but I found having the peplum start so high on my waist added undesirable fullness to my abdomen rather than making it looks smaller. I might try a 6 at some point to see if the seam hits in a lower, more flattering place in a larger size.","July 30, 2018","Small"

It was comfortable to wear all night. The only con to this dress was how large the top black portion was. The rest of the dress fit perfectly but the top gaped open whenever I sat down. I wear a 38D and the top was still very very large. I had to wear a black satin bra underneath so that way when it showed it didn't look too obvious.

Could have done regular size and probably had similar fit, but would have likely taken a little sucking in to zip (zip is near waist, and near delicate fabric so sizing up ended up being nice to not worry about grabbing any delicate fabric with zipper) forgiving for small belly bumps. This is a mini dress I'm 5'8"" for length reference. I wore with front a little open. Does tend to open a little in front, next time would wear black bra (wore tan and occasionally it would show slightly). The top is loose and flowy. Would rent again.","August 19, 2019","Party"

I was shocked at the construction for the price tag. I opened for an oversized top bc the waist is weird.

Thought it could have used a button to hold it as the tie, while adjustable was a bit unusual. One side felt smooth and the other felt bumpy along my waist.

I am 160lbs, 34C, usually a six but this I chose an 8R to allow some room and not too tight - yet this fit me exactly in the right places with an athletic build was very pleased. Love the scarf /ribbon effect in the back which hides the two openings and one hook of closure. Ladies, best worn with Spanx! Yes, Spanx, to give the smooth front and back look... :). Tons of compliments 'lady in red', I wore this with similar shoes as the model which worked well! Will definitely do again - arrival was as expected early part of the day... packaging was great too along with a 'backup' dress. That one, I wasn't as happy with due to being tighter than expected but this red one was right on. Return - simple, easy in the same packaging back to UPS drop off.","March 12, 2020","True to Size"

Keep in mind the material doesn’t stretch at all & the silhouette is more revealing than you’d expect because of how it is meant to hug the body.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR57","Emily","Epic color and detail","I loved this dress and received SO many great compliments. It was perfect for an autumn wedding. I didn't realize the little cut out details were sheer, so that was alarming. Also the slip would not stay down with my wide hips...luckily I wore nude Spanks shorts underneath so it was not noticeable.","October 14, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR57","Sarah","Stand-out dress for welcome drinks","Loved wearing this dress to welcome drinks the night before a black-tie wedding. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I didn't realize the cut across the top was so open and I was worried it would slip down and show too much. I think it was lower because I am pretty flat chested. I works have felt more comfortable if I used dress tape to keep it in place. It should also be noted that this dress is pretty heavy.","October 11, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR57","Malvina","Great for a garden wedding!","This dress caught my eye because of its rare mustard color and beautiful silhouette. It looked chic and modern. Open back was a nice bonus. I wore it to a wedding at the botanical gardens. Dress looked fitted while providing comfort and ease of movement. I absolutely loved it!","September 16, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR57","RTR Customer","The dress was a total highlight and I got so many compliments!","This dress was perfect for the derby party we went to. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because one of the lace details was slightly larger right by the bum which seemed to be from excessive wear which was a bit frustrating. Also, as the other reviews mentioned, the slip is extremely short and is definitely something to be aware of. I do have a long torso so I think this may have been worse for me. The dress seemed to fit true to size and the lace at the arms and back definitely do not lie flat as the other reviews also mentioned, but this did not bother me. Overall, the dress fit great and I would recommend it.","September 12, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR57","RTR Customer","Perfect Fall wedding dress!","Wonderful dress! I standby claims from other wearers about the slip being incredibly short and the back zipper not having a clip, so falling down just a bit. BUT I would 110% rent this again. Beautiful color & style. The material is thick and detailed so you don't need a bra necessarily (I'm like a 34B/C). I didn't wear another slip, just nude underwear and kept my boyfriend on radar if something went wrong (ha!), which it didn't even with a lot of dancing! Would definitely rent again.","September 11, 2019","Wedding"

I loved the length and the more conservative front paired with the open back to spice it up a little. The lining underneath is very short, but I wore nude color Spanx shorts and you couldn't even tell. Would definitely recommend planning to wear some sort of shorts or longer slip with the dress. An easy fix to wear a beautiful dress!","September 8, 2019","Wedding"

The ribbon color for childhood cancer happens to be gold so this was perfect. I received a lot of compliments and loved that it was so different than anything else I've worn. There was no room for any sort of bra since the back is cut out and it is super form fitting but I went without and thought it was fine.","August 25, 2019","Formal Affair"

Length was a bit longer on me than expected (I'm 5'4""), but worked out great. I didn't wear a bra (I'm relatively flat chested) but pasties would work because of the open back.","July 31, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR57","Jamie","What a beautifully made dress. I wore it to a summer evening wedding and received compliments on it.","I am 5’6”, 150 lbs, 34DD and I took the medium size. I am very curvy and found this to be a flattering dress. I wore my nude stick on bra and spanx skirt slip underneath because the lace cutouts hit my curvy butt at a place where you would have been able to see everything. For this reason I gave 4 stars. If you are curvy, you will want to wear a slip. There is enough fabric on top to go braless. Overall, this is a fantastic dress that I would rent again despite everything I mentioned.","July 28, 2019","True to Size"

I'm usually a size S/M in tops depending on the brand and this top was mostly true to size. It was a little tight in my shoulders, but I have broad shoulders so that usually happens. My only real complaint is that the class that holds the top together is a little fragile and pops open if I move my arms too much. I wore a black tank underneath to avoid any malfunctions, but for my bigger chested friends you may want to size up","August 15, 2019","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL79","Sabrina","Cute top but have to wear a cami under","I loved the quality, pattern, and sleeves on this top! The downside is that it is extremely short, the peplum cinch was right under my ribs and the peplum ruffle was not even long enough to cover my belly button. It is also a cross-over front and will not stay closed if you have a bust. So I solved by putting a cami underneath. For context, I am 5'4.5"" and wear a 34D bra.","February 29, 2020","Everyday"

This is definitely a crop, so pair with something high waisted. The cut is quite low for work - can get away with it if you are not busty (i am not, so the button closure was enough for me). I didn't mind the shortness on the sleeves, but the stitching is a bit weird and was pulling on my arms in places, particularly on the underside near my armpit and bicep.

I was not disappointed! The ruching in the stomach area has a lot of give to fit a range of hip sizes and the clasp in the front of the chest allows you to either be more conservative with cleavage or more covered.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL71","Sarah","Gorgeous pattern but some issues","I'm between a 6 and and 8 and the 8 was perfect. The pattern is gorgeous and I received multiple compliments. I really liked the fit. The downsides though were annoying. The zipper on the back was too stiff and went up my neck and stuck out in the back at the bottom a bit. The material, while gorgeous, felt a little cheap. And the buttons on the front kept pulling to the side - maybe the dress was cut on a weird bias because the were constantly pulling to the left and I had to adjust. Definitely a mini dress, I have a long torso and it was barely but thankfully appropriate. I would wear again for sure because it's lovely but with the design issues would never buy.","September 8, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL71","Maria","Rented for 4th of July family outing.","Fit: Im normally a size 8 but I sized up based on recommendations but I felt like I could have easily fit into my regular 8. The 10 was too big around my waist and due to my 36B I didn't have enough to fill it from the front. The front ended up sagging down so I had to wear a little tube top. The sleeves were too long for me so I ended up srunching them up. Material: The material overall was light and airy, you could wear it during a hot summer day and be fine. The underskirt (the white part) not sure if its by design but it does show. Overall: I think if you size it right this could be cute but I wasn't feeling it.","July 17, 2019","True to Size"

The v is a bit low for work as my bra pops out here and there. It didn't bother me as much as the white lining that stick out so much in the front right and back.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL71","Elizabeth","Fun print and easy to dress up or down","I honestly wished the skirt was fuller (it somehow made me look a little top heavy and I'm definitely more of a pear shape) but the deep v was shockingly flattering. A bit more cleavage than I usually show, but it was still appropriate around family and didn't show any of my bra. The cuffs and waist are very stretchy but the fabric itself has no stretch. I wore it with white sneakers, flats, sandals, and heels and they all worked equally well. The fabric is absolutely beautiful. Lightweight and doesn't wrinkle. I'm slim to begin with but I thought it made my waist look super tiny from the side view. The lining does show a little when you sit down but it's easy to pull the skirt down to cover it.","April 30, 2019","Party"

I had a 2P for back up size (no 0P available) and the length was better but top way too big. The ruching and ruffling is very flattering.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BDT15","Annie","I SOOOO wanted this to work but the top is problematic for larger chests.","I rented this for a video shoot for my own company where the video would be selling our entertainment and music services to brides (I'm also the lead singer). I absolutely fell in love with the disco ball effect of the jumpsuit online and, when I tried it on, the overall fit through my legs, butt, stomach & hips was perfect. However, I needed to be able to move and groove in this outfit without feeling like I was going to fall out up top, and the fit of the bodice was just not cutting it. For reference, I'm about 5' 5"", 135 lbs. 32/34 DD. First off, the strings that hold up the bodice are like bikini top strings and, I don't know about you other full chested ladies, but I never wear those kind of straps even on the beach because they can't hold up my breasts enough. Same problem here. I guess I just didn't notice how thin the straps were when I rented it but I ended up having to cinch up the strings so tight to be able to hold my breasts in place that I could barely move my neck. Then, even when in place and cinched tight, I had to stay almost still for my breasts to not pop out the sides. We tried putting double-sided tape on both sides of each breast and it helped but I just still couldn't move normally or freely. So, had to scrap it for this shoot and didn't wear it at all (drat!). I still give this outfit a 4 out of 5 since it's a beautiful jumpsuit. Especially in person, it's just scrupmtious and magnetic! A real showstopper. AND, if I had rented it to go clubbing or out on the town in Vegas, I would have had zero problem relaxing the strings a bit and using the double-sided tape, and just being a bit ""cheeky"" with my ladies. Big chested ladies -- just beware before renting, make sure you know that you will be showing a lot of middle and side boob. :)","March 4, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH364","Lauren","Pretty color, weird fit at bust - didn't wear it","I had rented this for date night, but wasn't able to wear it due to the fit in the shoulders and bust. The skirt portion of the dress was fitted (as expected), but the shoulders were a bit big and the seaming around the bust would not lay nicely - it folded over and out so you saw the inside of the dress. I'm a pear-shaped 34B w narrow shoulders, so it's not unheard of for the top of a dress to be big on me, but the fit at the bust is just odd. Not sure if my rental just needs to be pressed.","February 14, 2020","Date"

I had a friend comment that you might need to have a certain body type to look good in it - I think if you have bigger arms/shoulders, it might not be he most flattering, but I think it worked well for my frame. The fit that didn't work for me, however, was the bust. Since it’s lace, it's a fitted bust with no stretch. I’m an A cup and did not fill it out, which left the top looking somewhat deflated. I would not recommend this for another A cup person, unless you have a very good push up bra. But for B or C cups, i bet this would be great.","August 30, 2019","Wedding"

I sized up to a medium for a more flowy fit, but could have worn a small if the medium was not available. The dress flows behind when walking, and lays against your body in a flattering way when standing. The dress was worn to an outdoor California wedding with flats (the venue was rocky), but could be worn with nude heels for a more elegant feel. I'd also like to highlight Jesse from the RTR staff. Our flights from FL to CA were changed several times and Jesse ensured I received the dress on time.

I thought I would need fashion tape to keep the straps from falling, but the high neckline and cut of the dress made it so I didn't have to use the tape.

Everyone asked why I was all dressed up. The frills and light colors made me feel like a little doll. I loved it for maternity! I even considered purchasing it. Maybe later.","October 5, 2019","Party"

I didn't end up wearing this one. Dress runs slightly large overall, but the reason I didn't like it was because of how it fit up top. I wish I'd taken a photo, because it's kind of hard to describe. It was super baggy up top, and appeared to just kind of hang off of my body - not ideal with a straight neckline and elastic waist - it kind of just looked like I was wearing a sack. That being said, I may have just needed an XS versus my usual size S. The fabric was beautiful though - great drape and no wrinkling. Wish I had time to order and wait for a size XS before my event! Probably ideal for someone with larger breasts since there is plenty of room up top. The modesty factor & coverage is also very good if that's what you're going for.","November 25, 2019","Large"

Loved the way the dress looked in the front, but the back bow was really hard to tie on my own because the fabric is only black on one side - so you have to tie the bow just right in order for it to not look inside out. Overall, really cute. I normally wear a S and the M was perfect.","October 28, 2019","Small"

I'm glad I got both, since though the 8 fit, the lack of structure in the chest kinda pushed the girls flat. I opted for the 10, which was a little too big on my waist/hips, but the ruffles and midi length balanced everything out, and I had plenty of room to dance, eat & drink in this dress. The straps also run a little long (even though I'm 5'11.5""!!). Despite those minor fit issues, the pattern and look of this dress was absolute perfection. This dress is exactly why I do RTR unlimited - rather than spend $700+ on a dress I'll wear maybe twice in one season (& would have spent even more on tailoring the straps/taking in the waist), I can just size up here as needed! I will definitely rent this one again.","May 3, 2019","Wedding"

The fit is TTS & the fabric has plenty of stretch. I liked that the draped piece has a large snap to detach it while putting it on. Unfortunately the draping adds a lot of bulk that's not very flattering from the front or right side - as you can tell from my photos. It only looks good from the left. Also it's a bit too long for petites. Not something I'd rent again, even if I had an event. There are much more flattering styles to choose from.","September 12, 2019","Work"

The lining rode up a bit at times (which was already shorter). The dress also has no stretch. Other than that, it was comfy! I'd imagine the SR would have fit better in the mid-section for me but may have been more difficult to dance or walk up steps in. Beautiful dress. Love the color and lace.

I have a broad back (34b) so I would recommend sizing up to a medium if you are 34 or higher. Sizing up wasn't ideal bc then it was pretty loose fitting everywhere else but this dress is pretty and photographs well. The caviat -like others mentioned- is that the straps are not safe. One popped off mid-wedding and luckily I brought a safety pin based on reviews and just seeing they looked barely held on by the threading.","November 5, 2019","Wedding"

This wasn’t even under consideration when I was trying to choose dresses for vacation. In an act of desperation I ordered at the last minute and never regretted it! This dress is beautifully made, is so feminine and has vibrant colors that don’t quite come across in the pictures. And the trendy mixed patterns with colors just give you the ultimate push to stand out in any event. It is true to size with little give. If you have heavy boobs you may have to pin the cleavage area as the button kept popping open- minor downside.... a MUST rent! 38D, 185lbs, 5’6” & curvy.","January 26, 2020","True to Size"

The waist/bust situation worked for me and I'm pretty comfortable braless, but I could see it becoming a problem for others. I loved the fit in the end, but I definitely had to finesse the wrap portion and the straps when I first put it one. Still a winner though!!!","December 29, 2019","Vacation"

The XS fit snug but wasn't uncomfortable--the top of the S was too big and the wrap too loose.

The bodice runs tight, and the zipper likes to get stuck at a seam, so it's not the easiest to put on. Then, there is this short, clingy thin white layer underneath. While I appreciated some coverage, since the wrap piece would fly up, it was just not comfortable in any way. Returning after one wear.

It's super lightweight so it's great for a summer party, even if you're out in the sun you won't sweat through it. It's very flattering.

(34 years old, 3 kids, 34C) but I loved it and felt it was well worth the time it took to tape myself into a younger looking lady. I normally wear an 8, on the line of being a 6.

It was a hot day, 90 degrees, but the dress felt cool and light. I love it so much that I almost considered buying it, but don't have enough occasions to wear it.

Finally! The 4R is available! I have never added something so to my cart and confirmed shipment so quickly! RTR recommended a 2R but I am a pretty true 4 all around and so I went with the 4R (plus, RTR size recommendations are seldom correct for me). The 4 fits me fine, I had to pin the top together so I wasn't exposing my bra, but I'm almost certain I could have gotten away with the 2R. I have a good inch to inch and a half of fabric at the waist that I could have filled out. Walking in the dress is fine for me but if you have stairs or a rolling chair at work, you will need to bunch and hike so you're not tripping over it - and I'm 5'7 in 3.5-inch heeled booties. So if you're short, this dress is probably not for you. The hem is uneven which wasn't very clear on the model so it would take some maneuvering to tape a shorter hem.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/GRJ52","Marianne","Great fit and beautiful flow","Got this yesterday and already obsessed with it. Nicer than I thought it would be. It's a perfect autumn dress with material that is flow-y but also warm enough. It's thick enough to wear with no bra if that gives an indication! Fits wise, I am usually a 4 and went for a 2 and it is the perfect size. But the reason for that is that the only place that's really 'fitted' is the waist - so judge the size by your waist size. If you have a smaller waist (like me), keeping it as your normal size or going one size down is a great move. If not then you may want to size up. Length wise, it's true to the photos here. I'm a bit over 5""9 and the length was spot on, exactly like you see in the photo on this page (long but not touching your feet). In short, a keeper!","November 8, 2019","True to Size"

The waist tie helped to give a little shape, but I have very curvy hips and I felt like most of my shape was lost in the fabric. I wore it anyways because I didn't hate it, but, a little frumpy and more yellow than the model photos.","March 26, 2019","Large"

It possibly won't have a long lifespan. The 8 fit like a roomy medium. TTS. The fabric is matte in some spots and shiny in others (two colored fabrics with two different sides used). It looks a bit like a parachute, but it doesn't feel like one. I'm 5'6"" and it was the perfect length. Didn't drag on the ground in flats. It'll be far too long for. 5'2"" gal.

The embroidery is beautiful and NOT scratchy! A bra is not required with this dress, but I used tape to feel more secure on the dance floor.

Other women around my same height rented a 6L, so I changed my order from a 4R to a 6L and I am so happy that I did! The 6L dress fit perfectly. The wedding was also black tie preferred so I did worry a little about being under dressed... I shouldn't have worried at all because once I received the dress I saw that the stitching and fine details were so lovely and sophisticated that it was definitely formal enough for this particular event.

But this year I'm slimmer (10-12) and was so excited to rent this beautiful dress for my husband's formal holiday gala. I think I had the most beautiful dress at the event. So, it definitely runs small; don't kid yourself, but get your backup in the larger size. It was snug, but I was able to dance, sit, etc. I got a million compliments. I didn't wear a bra and that was not a problem (the pattern obscures any ""headlights"" I might ordinarily worry about, hehe).

The dress honestly looked as if it was tailored specifically for her, and had heads turning all night. The gala had a futuristic theme, so she styled the gown with a sleek high ponytail, a bright red lip and a pop of yellow with her bag.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN155","Mj","This dress made me feel like a Glamorous Warrior Goddess!","Pros: Beautiful detailing, the peek-a-boo midsection, the fit makes the booty pop. Lot's of compliments throughout the night. I loved that it covered my shoulders as I have a tattoo that I don't like to show off at formal events. Cons: Backup dress came with a strange velvet bow that was not advertised in the photos. At 5'9"" the 8L did not touch the floor so it hovered above my shoes. Could not wear this dress with shapewear due to the tight fit and the peek-a-boo midsection. If you have wide hips then you will need to size up because this dress has absolutely no stretch or give to it. It is made for hourglass proportions, not the apples or the pears of this world. Overall this dress made me feel so strong, confident, and glamorous at the gala. Unfortunately there was another woman there wearing the same dress but we had a good laugh about it.","September 6, 2019","Small"

I got so many compliments on it!","There isn't a lot of stretch in this dress, so while it it lovely, it's not the best dress for dancing. It's also shorter than I expected, I am about 5' 4"" and had to wear flats with the size 2. I did receive a lot of compliments on it and felt good in the dress. I runs a tad small, I usually wear a 0 in dresses but sized up.","September 3, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN155","Rosa","Everyone asked who I was wearing","Initially I was disappointed when receiving this dress because it does run small. I sized up to the 6 and found it to still be more form fitting than preferred (the zipper seemed to curl and there was visible pulling in the front). However I stopped myself from calling for a backup after viewing other renters' photos and seeing how the fit of the dress is supposed to be. I packed a pair of Spanx instead and hoped for the best. Also the dress runs short. The picture of the model shows a horizontal band of fabric but this band is not included in the regular length. I'm 5'2"" and the dress did not hit the ground when I stood on bare feet. Keep this in mind if you are taller than me and expect to wear high heels. I wore a 3"" heel and was fine with the length. The third point I will note is that the zipper comes up to your mid back, making it uncomfortable to lean back against a hard surface since the zipper will press into your spine. Despite these challenges, the dress turned out to be a gem. I received a million compliments and everyone asked who I was wearing. I would definitely recommend this dress to others, but be aware of sizing when you order (size up and consider length). Perfect dress for an Indian wedding!","August 19, 2019","Wedding"

I have a 26 inch waist and the size 0 sat just barely below my natural waist, unstretched. The whole back of the waistband is elastic, so they could definitely fit a larger size person. They were the perfect length for me to wear flats without stepping on them. They're great quality and lined above the knee, not sheer at all. I'm not sure if the short lining would be noticeable outside in the sun but I don't think it was noticeable in my office. They felt nice and lightweight so I think they'd be good for year round weather. They did wrinkle pretty easily, but I don't think they looked too terrible because of it.","August 23, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN190","Alexandra","Fancy pants!","True to size, but a bit of elastic in the back of the waist adds a bit of give. Color was fun, super comfortable, and a breezy vibe for summer. They are lined to about the knee, which I found just made it hot. The polyester has a nice drape, but lacks breathability. Good for an air-conditioned office in the summer, but would be too hot for outside on a summer day.","July 24, 2019","True to Size"

Still the 2 was fine, just a little big in the waist, but nothing too concerning. The pants are a bit cropped. I assumed they'd go to the floor (I am 5'6""), but they cut a little closer to the low shin/ankle. I thought it looked funky at first, but it ended up working out!

There is elastic in the waistband, so there is some give if you need it. I think they are supposed to be high waisted, but hung in my hips so the crotch of the pant was 4 inches too low. Oddly, with them hanging on hips and low crotch, the pant length was just right for me at 5'4"", so tall girls beware, these pants may be too short for you","June 4, 2019","Work"

It's an off-white base (I think the top it's paired with in the RTR photo makes it look like a brighter white). This is such a fun, pretty pair of pants. The floral pattern is really beautiful and unique, and the cut is pretty flattering. I often have to size up in bottoms (2 or 4), but I'm glad I went with the 0 - it was even a little roomy, and certainly comfortable. I didn't like that the lining of the pants stops at the knee. It didn't look obvious or bad, it just felt kind of weird having a hem rub against my knees. These are excellent for petite ladies!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN190","RTR Customer","Love Fabric and Flow/Strange Waist...","These pants are fully lined and zip on the side. They are very high waisted. The waist has a few inches of elastic in the back. Pros: amazing pattern, flow beautifully, very comfortable. Cons: they are cut very straight in between the waist & hips, so I don't get the flow off the waist that I would like. Additionally, the elastic in the back causes the fabric below it to bunch and stick out, so instead of seeing my shape and my ass, it looks like I have a flat butt and that I'm very wide. All of this to say, these pants look amazing from the hip downward, but are a hot mess from waist to hip for someone curvy. I got the bigger end of my pants size range and they are too big around the waist, but oddly tight around the tummy. Anyway, all of this to say I am still wearing these, but with something that goes to hips: a stretch white button down that is tight, creates shape to my hips and then the pants flow from there. I could not wear these with a shirt tucked in.","June 6, 2019","Large"

I am a little heavier right now so I ordered the M and L and the L fit best because I'm built straight up and down at the waist. The top was a little big but not bad. I used double sided tape to keep the straps in place. The skirt is AMAZING. There are sequins on the embroidered flowers that sparkle in the light.

I would probably size down if I rented again as it was a little long on me in both the dress and sleeves (however, I am 5').

It does run small as I used the backup size. Only issue I had was that the top the dress kept rolling forward a bit.

I thought the top half was a little big around the chest while around my hips it fit just right. I used dress tape to make sure everything stayed in place - mainly to feel more comfortable. If you like to dance like me, you might feel a little restricted because the style is very fitting. While sitting, I did have adjust the top occasionally. The cutout in the middle of the dress was hidden for me because I have a short torso but I still loved the style. You won't need a sticky bra for this dress - I didn't wear a bra at all.

I'm a true 4 and the small fit everywhere except around the rib cage. I'm fairly certain that a medium would've been too big in the chest and hips but be warned if you're not a 30 Bra band size this will be right. I'm small 32B and needed a push up, without a bra the dress was a lot more breathable but lacked the ""it factor"". Comfort aside, it was a great pick.

It was hard to sit in, go up stairs, and dance in. I was constantly adjusting the top. It looked great in photos but was not worth the discomfort.
