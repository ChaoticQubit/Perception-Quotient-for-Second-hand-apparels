I've worn it to school, work, and for a simple walk in the park! I wore a size Medium, but I think I would've felt a bit more comfortable with a large- for the simple fact that I like my jackets a bit loose on me. It's not a stretchy material.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SB104","Jenny","Lovely color and fabric but didn't like the sleeves","I liked this dress for a warm fall day; the material is heavy enough so it doesn't wrinkle, and the color is really nice, almost a peachy orange. But the sleeves were hard to tie and I didn't like how they looked or how the strings felt. I also think they needed to make the back zipper longer as it doesn't stretch so was hard to pull off. I only wore it once because of those points.","October 26, 2019","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SB104","Christine","Fun- casual but work appropriate","Lovely fall color- I would call it burnt orange. Small around the chest and shoulders. Busty ladies can consider sizing up- but the a-line cut will make the skirt larger. Easily wrinkled so if you are up and down all day you may not want this one.","October 24, 2019","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SB104","Julia","Not for busty women","For reference, I typically range from a size 2-4, and am typically more of a 2 in dresses. I have my rent the runway set to a size 4 though, just because it's nicer when things are a little too large rather than a little too small. The dress was very cute but SO tight in the chest. I don't have tiny boobs, but they aren't huge either. If you size up, you run the risk of it looking very boxy. I would be forewarned that it's not for bustier women.","July 30, 2019","Small"

I’m usually a 2 or 4 in pants (my hips!) and I wanted these to be relaxed and they were great. Actually kind of roomy throughout which is nice for non-stretch jeans, although they did sag just a little after wearing all day. They still looked great even when they were saggier but the crotch seam then fit at a place between my thighs that rubbed a little when I walked. I might try the 2 if I rented again but I suspect they might be too tight or less comfortable.","February 5, 2019","True to Size"

Also the v-neck is a deep V so can show a lot of cleavage- I kept the top button clasped which reduced a bit of the cleavage. Overall beautiful dress and super comfy!!","May 21, 2019","Party"

The dress has a slight waist detail to pull it in a bit, and the keyhole adds interest in the front. It is quite low, but the dress would be matronly without the pop.

The lips pattern is pretty subtle and most people will think they are hearts. When I initially rented this dress, I based my sizing off the model picture thinking the dress was a shift and a little shapeless, but not true! It has a nice defined waist although the sleeves are puffy. The neckline is actually a keyhole that is better buttoned than open like on the model because it tends to flap open and show too much cleavage when left open. Might be a different result for smaller chested girls (I'm a 32D) but regardless it was cute and I got a lot of compliments on it!","February 28, 2019","True to Size"

It was actually quite fitted and flattering. The pattern is so cute, and was perfect for a Valentine's Day date night. However, the v-neck is pretty deep, and I found this was cut fairly small on top. As a result, there was a LOT on view, and I absolutely could not wear this to work without a cami underneath. Even then, the girls were squeezed a bit, so probably a little more cleavage than I'd normally allow at the office. Overall, adorable, but for limited purposes.","February 18, 2020","Small"

The colors are more beautiful in person and there is beautiful stitching detail that you can't see in the photo. The fabric is THICK but has stretch so it hugs every curve (definitely recommend Spanx, even if you're thin, just to smooth everything out. Although the fabric is thick, it does show some ""bumps""). It created a very beautiful silhouette. My only complaint is the top. It is cut straight across and just fits very strange. The dress as a whole fit small, but the chest was HUGE. You could see straight down the top when I was just sitting. Maybe better for a smaller chest so it lays more flat? I don't know but it was odd.","October 24, 2019","Small"

The shoulders and arm length were great.

However with my bigger bust it meant the white line was only just below my boobs so if it wasn't perfectly flattering -if I had a flatter chest the shirt would've sat a little better where it supposed to it definitely doesn't make you look very slim. it's a fun look if you pair it with some tight skinny jeans. I would recommend for a C cup and below as my D cup was a little bit too much for the shirt to make it look the way it should.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ZDV28","Amanda","J'aime beaucoup!","This is not at all what I expected, but I loved wearing this sweater! First of all, it is THIN. I thought this would be more of a sweatshirt top material, but it's a fine knit. If it's cold you're going to need something on underneath. I wore a tank but wished I had worn long sleeves under it. However that makes it breathe nicely. I'm normally an XS but got an M because I wanted it to be a bit oversized. Even sizing up, however, it wasn't long enough to wear with leggings like I thought it would be; it's more of a square shape but if you have a shorter torso it might work. The sleeves were long on me, covered my hands, but that's to be expected a few sizes up. The letters are more of an off-white than white. It is soft and comfy. I will say, the BEST thing about wearing this sweater is the light it carries. Everywhere I went people were reading it and smiling, smiling at me, one guy waved at me from across the street (not in a creepy way! Lol). I felt like I was spreading love just by wearing it and I smiled all day long it returned the favor. I don't normally wear things with phrases on them unless I really believe in what they say, and I would absolutely rent this again to feel l'amour.","January 9, 2019","Everyday"

My pair did NOT come with the tie shown in the picture. The pants were WAY too big in the waist and, even for high rise, the waist was way too long. I could have hiked these up over my boobs and I still would have had a droopy crotch. The pants looked like I needed a large belly to fill it out. I think that my thighs are a bit too large to make the flared bottoms look flared enough. This was a huge fail on in my books.

I wore this on vacation in Spain in winter and it was warm but not too warm (40-50 degrees). It also doubled as a great blanket on the plane. It can add bulk around the hips where the pockets are so it probably doesn't look super flattering straight on if you hands are in the pockets.

I wore in in about 50 degree weather with fairly thin layers underneath and was warm enough but not overheated (although I was pretty constantly walking).

However i typically wear size 4 and could have definitely worn a small. With that being said it was gorgeousssssss! Flows when you walk and at 5'3 it didn't touch the ground. I wore a lace bralette under because i was going out with family but you can do a stick on bra or pasties with this. Pair with layered chains and jeans or shorts and you have the perfect summer outfit. A little more stylish than a typical maxi. Will definitely rent again!","June 1, 2019","Everyday"

The L was too small around and I have a 29 inch waist. The XL felt big everywhere else. The buttons were impossible to button.

Fit is true to size, I'm a true 6 and got a medium, but it's the kind of dress that would probably still look fine if you didn't get your ideal size.","June 28, 2019","Work"

Like any legging should, they have nice stretch so as to be flexible in sizing above the knee, but suddenly they become wide and unfitted below the knee which, with the faux leather material, results in a really odd and, frankly, cheap look (like a plastic bag that stretched and didn't go back in place).","April 1, 2019","Large"

Appropriate length as well - sleeves just a tad long but not noticeably so. Fits true to size but there is zero stretch - the arms are quite narrow, so if you are bigger in that area this dress will not work for you. I love the dual navy satin / black chiffon look, the only thing that is a bit weird is that the tie-across sits a bit drapey, not 100% diagonally/taught.

It's really cute, but as someone who is rather busty, the transition from the pink to the navy hit right in the middle of my chest and made everything look very angular and strange.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are able to wear a standard bra with this dress. At 5’6”, the length hit mid-thigh on me; but the entire hem is high-low. The pattern on the dress is amazing in person and the buttoned sleeves add a nice touch. Pair with nude heels, sneakers and fun earrings to complete your outfit!","August 10, 2018","True to Size"

I do recommend wearing double stick tape between the buttons where your chest is largest. It kept gaping open. If not so expensive, I would definitely buy this.","July 18, 2018","Vacation"

It was snowing with a wintry mix out in NYC today, and I was super warm with just that and my winter coat. I was warm and toasty at work too. It definitely needs to be paired with high-waisted pants though, because it is cropped. It's not overly short like most cropped tops though.

I came VERY close to buying this brand new with the tag on. The ONLY thing I wish this romper had was pockets. If it had pockets I'm pretty sure I would have shelled out the $ for it. I wore this to work and then out that night with a denim jacket. Of course the biggest drawback with this, and any romper, is that you have to take off your entire outfit to pee. I only wore petals underneath so I felt utterly naked in a bathroom stall. Pretty sure some people saw through those little stall-cracks, but oh well--live free! I cannot stress how much I enjoyed wearing this. I will say this; if you don't like attention, don't rent this romper. I didn't look particularly good or different the day I wore this but believe me when I say that EVERYBODY was looking at me all day. A little boy on the bus in the morning stared at me for 10 minutes straight. Red is a powerful color, folks, wear it wisely. Pictures do not do it justice. It wears a little loose, and the tie in the back is hard to do alone if you don't have someone to tie it for you but I managed. The length came to about my ankles, I'm 5'3 with a long torso. The XS was long enough so I don't think long-torso-people need to size up like with some rompers. It feels pretty free-flowing true-to-size. I ended up wearing this 2 days in a row. I'll definitely rent again and I wholeheartedly recommend you try this fun piece out yourself.","June 25, 2019","Everyday"

So glad I DIDN'T listen to the reviews saying this ran big, because in my case if did not. The medium is my normal size and it fit me very well. If I had done the small I there is no way I would have been able to button the top buttons. The Critique I have to share is about the buttons. The buttons are so cute, but They are not very functional. The only downside to this dress is sometimes the buttons come undone, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that the buttons are crouched and the button holes are large.

However, the bottom part of the wrap dress has buttons to hold it together but they don't go very far down your leg. It also weirdly has a lot of heavy fabric (separate panel for the buttons underneath the top layer). As you're walking, the slit kicks open with every step and there's really nothing you can do about it except try to hold it shut as you walk.

I put it on and quickly realized that the elastic waist makes the top balloon out above my waist and the skirt balloon out below it. When you add to that the faux-wrap feature, that’s just another layer on top of the ballooning. I tried tying it around the back like I read in the reviews, but the skirt beneath has an odd style to it— it’s cut like the conservative denim skirts my mother wore to church in the 90’s. So then I was blobby AND school-marmy. But with major cleavage. In general, I’d call this dress a risk and suggest getting a second, back-up style JUST IN CASE so you don’t end up tearing apart your closet in a panic like I did.","January 14, 2020","True to Size"

Also, when I received it, it was slightly puckering at the seams and even steaming it didn't get these wrinkles out. So I wouldn't count on it for an all-day polished look.

On top of being very chic and having pockets, it's constructed very well and great quality. The white is a little off-white, so it's forgiving for sitting on park benches or anywhere that may not be the cleanest. The zipper is also great quality, which adds a bit of weight to the skirt.

Because of how pale I am, I rarely wear white but this was a worthy exception. I was able to wear it on a windy day without getting all that cold which is a bonus for me.

The fabric is very thick, high-quality, and not see through it all. The color is a bright light cream-it's not exactly white. It fit well on the waist but wasn't tight on the butt or thighs. The front zipper is fully functional and it stayed put the whole day. It wrinkled slightly after a whole day of wear. The length is appropriate if you're really tall. The fabric has a tiny bit of stretch to it but I wouldn't rely on that. Also it has two giant pockets in the front and in the back abs they fit so much. I hate tiny pockets you can't actually put anything in. I adore this skirt; it's a great closet staple and it's upsetting to send back","July 12, 2018","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF194","Christine","Fabulous fit. Runs 1 1/2 - 2 sizes small. Great length for taller girls.","This skirt fits fabulously, but make sure to order 1 1/2 - 2 sizes up from your regular size. I rented this skirt in size 12 compared to my regular size 8 (sometimes 10; I am 5'8"", 155 lbs) and it fit perfectly. Extremely flattering fit. While the description calls this a ""mini"" skirt, I think this is a fairly regular length skirt at 19"" long, not a mini skirt. The material is very thick (with no lining), which covers any bumps, doesn't show underwear, and doesn't show the tucked-in shirt color. The zipper can be opened from both sides, in case you want to show more leg. The only minor negative is that the zipper doesn't lie flat.","July 5, 2018","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF194","Esmeralda","Nice change of pace","The skirt runs small. I went up a size but as the day went on I thought I should have gone up two sizes. Because if you can tell from the pic the zipper puckers and perhaps it would have layen better if I had gone up in size. Over all the skirt is one of a kind. I enjoyed wearing it.","June 12, 2018","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF194","Meghan","Loved the style, shape, construction. But the waist was way too tiny!","This skirt is undeniably cute. Great shape, comfortable fabric, and not too short. However, the waist was way too small! I'm a 4 in the waist, 6 in the hips (big booty girls, where you at) and so I sized up to 6. The skirt looked great: wasn't tight in the booty (which is usually my problem with mini skirts) but was too tight in the waist. Then I sized up to the 8, but the waist was only marginally bigger. I could zip it up, but anytime I bent over, or sat down, or basically moved, the top zipper unzipped! I was surprised there was no hook to keep it closed. I thought about sizing up one more time, but the 8 already puckering in the front, and so I decided to return it.","February 6, 2020","Small"

I was surprised when the jacket arrived, the overall feel of the jacket was more like a chunky sweater. I think it's because the sleeves are very thin and do not have the sherpa lining, it lacked structure. The body of the jacket does have the sherpa lining so it would likely be warm. As other reviewers mentioned the jacket does run very large. I ordered a small for my 4/6 size and it was still a little big. Depending on you style it, it may work.

I have a mini-bump (16 weeks) so I sized up, and I shouldn't have. The cut is roomy so I'd say stick with your normal size even if you like a looser fit, or maybe go down one if you want a more fitted look. The neck tie was a little awkard in a bow, but looked fine with a double-knot. The fabric is on the thicker side and feels a bit stiff. Overall a great work dress with beautiful details.","December 20, 2017","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SB45","Lisa e","Cute feminine work dress","The fabric was not at all what I expected - I thought it would be very smooth and light (maybe it was the ""airy"" in the title) but it is quite stiff and almost a little crinkly. It wasn't bad though and holds its a-line shape nearly as a result, although it does wrinkle a little too. The stiffness also made the bow harder to tie and it didn't drape as much as I'd like. The color is beautiful though, a nice cool gray. The fit was a bit loose but with a nice shape - there is no zipper so you can't really size down for a smaller fit or you wouldn't be able to get it on. The wrists are nice and tight (with zippers that are a bit difficult to do up yourself) and have a pleasing pleat detail. In terms of length, a fairly conservative knee-grazing hemline. Overall very nice for work, but not too terribly special for me.","November 22, 2017","Work"

The color is a pale grey/blue. So pretty! I had to wear a cami underneath as the neckline is quite low. Unfortunately the lines of the waist of the cami showed through. I think I need to wear a cropped cami next time.","November 20, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SB45","Emily","Beautiful, comfortable, flattering dress","This dress is beautiful. The fabric is heavier than I initially expected. It has a wonderfully soft and warm lining which makes all the difference in terms of comfort. The tie collar was a bit troublesome at first - I kept attempting a bow but I couldn't get it to lay properly (and I like to consider myself pretty well-equipped when it comes to bow-tying). In any case, I opted to skip the bow and just do the first under-over layer of tying. It laid quite nicely and stayed put with minimal adjustments. Another favorite detail: the sleeves. The elongated tight wrist is a unique, classy touch. I styled this with white slides as it is still early Fall but could see myself renting again to wear with black tights and booties. All in all, it is a nice, comfortable, stylish dress. True to size.","October 30, 2017","True to Size"

I do suggest going up a size for your back up size, because the fit is a little straight and the fabric has no stretch. This dress is super comfortable, giving you room to move around as you please. A standard bra works just fine and the dress hit me a little bit over the knee.","October 26, 2017","True to Size"

Were it not for my big chest, I'd be a 42. The fabric and lings also were good. Great for a winter birthday dinner party. it's a little low cut but for me that works well.

The fabric beautifully flowed with my body, the sleeves were gorgeous and the bow put the entire thing together. It really was a statement dress. I wore it to work with opaque stockings and low ankle suede booties. I got a ton of compliments! I'm going to hold onto it a bit longer to wear it to a nice brunch or afternoon tea session with the girls. It's very English but also doesn't make you look too mature wearing it. If anything, it makes you look very put together. I didn't have the problem that others had with the bow or chest showing, so I didn't need to wear a cami or anything. I also didn't need to wear a slip because it was nicely lined, which was awesome! Oh and my favorite thing about the dress? It doesn't wrinkle!","February 15, 2019","True to Size"

I went up two sizes and found they were a little big in the waist but tight in the butt, which flattened it and boxed out my waist line a little. And then they bagged out in the legs, butt and waist.

I do like the overall fit of the sweater, which was boxy but not oversized. It was short but I wouldn’t say cropped. It did, however, actually feel a little shrunken on me – the sleeves were a good four inches short of my wrists and while it fit correctly and not too small in the shoulders, it was a little constricting (perhaps because of the thickness of the knit). The yarn was very soft but I wouldn’t say it exactly felt like cashmere-soft – definitely not itchy to me though.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BSH23","Cristie","Stylist Review","I love this little comfy and boho casual dress ba&sh! Running true to size with stretch in the waistband, I recommend wearing your true size, and going up a size for your free back up. This style is roomy throughout the top midsection and flowy at the hips. It works best for all cup sizes. You are, are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress. At 5'3, the length hit lower mid-thigh on me, but you can kind of adjust the waistband the make the hem hit where you would like. I love the little metallic detail in the print. You can pair with sneakers or sandals for a casual day and then take the look from day tonight with some fun strappy gold heels!","May 5, 2018","True to Size"

As many have said, it does run a bit large as you can see in some of the pics and it's quite voluminous if you don't use the drawstring waist which is tucked inside of the coat.

Cinching the waist and hem cords helped to give it a little shape, but with the coat zipped all the way up and cords cinched, I couldn't take normal strides! It was heavy and seemed very warm, but it just didn't work for me. The knit sleeves were quite tight and definitely could not wear long sleeves underneath.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KF28","Lisa e","Great mid-season jacket!","The jacket is roomy but I didn’t find it insanely oversized the way some other people described it - there’s a waist elastic (adjustment tabs are on the inside of the coat) which were super cinched when it arrived and I was actually surprised how fitted it was. I don’t prefer an hourglass-shaped jacket so I let those out which results in a straighter and more voluminous shape which I found on-trend. I do like to wear a jacket unbuttoned and it’s fairly swingy when it’s not zipped up, but I also liked it zipped. Very high quality, the finish of the fabric is a bit satiny. Four zip pockets are super great for holding everything. A small quibble is that I didin’t love the zipper - a little chunky and rough, and double zippers are so needlessly difficult to hold together to start the zip (who really finds it that useful to be able to unzip a coat from the bottom?). In terms of the weight, I would characterize this as not a winter coat but pretty good for nearly winter. I thought it might be a bit warmer and ordered it to try in late New York winter (early March), and luckily the temperatures turned a bit warmer when I had it. It’s great for like 40s and 50s, but much colder than high 30s it would not be warm enough unless maybe you layered a lot (which certainly there is room in the coat to do). In terms of layering also note that the cuffs, which are the whole forearm really, are quite tight, so you may have trouble wearing a really bulky sweater underneath because of this, especially if it’s one with a thick folded cuff.","March 17, 2019","Large"

And the sleeves, oh the sleeves. My absolutely favorite part. They're big and voluminous without looking crazy and totally add to the structural appeal of this sweater. The hemline is a high-low one perfect for french tucking it into high waisted bottoms.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RMB69","Lisa","Cute and stylish but sleeves too long","I love the 80s look of this jacket with the puffy sleeves and shoulder pads. It gives a little flare to a boring black jacket. The material is an all season crepe like material and good quality. I am normally a 12 and it fit true to size. I only had two complaints. First I'm petite and the sleeves were very long on me. I tried rolling them up but they would not stay. I tried pushing them up but they were not quite tight enough. The other was the button. There's just one but it's almost as if the hole is not wide enough and I kept struggled to get it in and out. For long term wear I could see myself accidentally pulling off the button. I would enlarge the hole slightly if I owned it.","August 15, 2019","Work"

Soft leather and classic circle cut makes for a great garment. Lining does run a tad long, but it was t too noticeable with dark opaque tights.","January 27, 2020","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VD24","Natalie","Classic sexy staple piece","After reading the reviews I was afraid it was going to be tiny, but to me it felt true to size if not a little bigger. I did feel like it stretched out while sitting which is more obvious by the length and flare in the standing photo (I know, circle skirt, but still). I have bigger legs and butt so this allowed me to get the mini skirt feel without the pulling in the butt, thighs, and gap in the waist. Perfect for a night out almost anywhere. Definitely purchasing.","November 30, 2019","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VD24","Rita","Softest leather","I have a 26 inch waist, and the small fit perfectly. I prefer skirts to sit high up on the waist, and this one did just that. It's made of super soft and supple leather and was a great skirt to wear out at night. The only negative would be that it does wrinkle easily-- I packed it on a trip and had to lay it out for a day to give it time to unwrinkle. This isn't a look I would normally go for, but so glad I did.","July 31, 2019","Vacation"

I'm usually a size 6, occasionally a size 4. I got the medium despite everyone saying to size up and it fits absolutely perfectly. The length is cute, not too short, not too long.

Two stars for the beautiful, buttery leather, but minus three for fit. I'm a solid 12 or large. Sometimes if something runs small I'll size up to a 14 or XL. Just to be on the safe side I sized up to XXL. That just wasn't enough. I had to shimmy my way into the skirt and suck everything way in while praying to the fashion gods to get it to zip. I succeeded, but I did not think it looked so great. I was going to take this on a business trip, but clearly this isn't going to work out. For reference, the lay flat measurement of the waist on this skirt for the XXL is 15.5"".","September 28, 2018","Work"

It definitely didn't look too big and the length was good for me, I wanted it to sit higher on my waist which would have required me to get my normal size small. I typically wear 26 waist bottoms so I think sizing depends on wear you want it to sit on you. Will see if I can wear the M again but would love to give the S a try!","September 22, 2018","Everyday"

After reading reviews I rented a medium, figuring it might sit loose/low on the waist. That was a correct hypothesis. With opaque tights it was decent, barely, for work. I think my problem with this skirt is that it's a cross between a circle and an a-line, which is a little risque at this length -- I really a black leather skirt like this to be a cross between an a-line and a pencil, more conservative, with less flare at the mid thigh length.","March 21, 2019","Small"
