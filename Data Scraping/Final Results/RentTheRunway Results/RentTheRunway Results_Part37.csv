This blazer is slightly fitted at the waist, so not a boxy/rectangular shaped blazer. Because it's more fitted, it doesn't look great if you wear it unbuttoned. The bottom portion of the blazer awkwardly flaps out. I think on most people, this blazer would look better buttoned up but I didn't love how that looked on me personally.

I'm so upset that I couldn't do it justice in the pictures. It looks so much better in person. It can be dressed up with some nice pumps or down with boots or booties.

For whatever reason the front of this shirt is not secure anywhere, and it's flowy so that one small movement and your entire stomach is showing. And your chest. It doesn't help that the only thing holding the shirt closed is one of those teeny tiny buttons that, let's be honest, never stays buttoned and that would be particularly unfortunate on a shirt that is not capable of holding itself up and together to begin with. Luckily I noticed this mishap in the comfort of my own home and safety pinned the hell out of it so I could go out in public. But if the fine folks at RTR want to do everyone a solid and sew the inside lining together or remove this shirt from circulation so no one suffers a career limiting sudden movement or utter mortification, that'd be much appreciated. designers should design for people and not mannequins!","June 5, 2019","Work"

It's true to French sizing. The 10R fits like a true 6. The cons: it's wrinkles extremely easily, and if you get any water on it, it will ""stain"" it. Upon very close inspection, I noticed it had stains on it everywhere. This isn't noticeable, but after I spilled some water on it, the darkness from the water spot never really went away as it dried.

The front is super low cut and requires double-sided tape to not flap open, or simply wearing a cami underneath like I did, for modesty. The length was perfect and I'm not very tall so taller gals keep this in mind and find appropriate shoes. I ended up wearing ankle booties with 3"" heels and it was still a good length. It's true to size and the empire waist area is where you need to keep the true-to-size in mind. If you have a bigger ribcage, you might need to size up for that area. Otherwise, it's free-flowing by size. It does have a slit on one leg, beware on windy days like we had :D","September 23, 2019","True to Size"

It is very, very thick and warm, so you almost don't need a coat with it in lower temperatures. The color is great for the holidays because it's not red/green overload and can be easily dressed up or down. My only (very minor) gripe (not even enough to dock a star) is that the torso length is semi-cropped. On me, it came down to just below my belly button. I generally size up for thicker tops, including sweaters, and I'm very glad I did because I think, while a small would have been perfectly fine in other aspects, it probably would have been too short for my preference. tl;dr: very warm, very soft, will rent again","December 25, 2019","True to Size"

I am normally a size 10 on top and the shoulders were still a little bit big but I kinda liked how that looked. With the belt folded and tied( it comes unfolded and looks so weird when it's just hanging), this dress was super flattering and I loved the full skirt and pockets. The sleeves were a little long and tight so I unbuttoned them and folded them up. Highly recommend this especially if it's warm out because the fabric is pretty thick. I would definitely rent again.","June 30, 2019","Party"

The shape is flattering for pear or hourglass and would work well for large busts. The crossover top is stitched so there is none of the gaping open that can happen. Belt is nice and wide and attached along the back. From waist up there was just too much fabric for this to be a real winner for me.

However, after one afternoon of wearing it, I reallyyyy didn't like this coat. The top part was too tight for my shoulders and kept cutting into my underarms. I also have long arms, and the coat sleeves were too short. Only the bottom two sets of buttons on the double-breasted closure have buttonholes, which means the coat can't close up all the way. And then the pockets. They are set high up on the coat and with a narrow opening at the top of the pocket, making it uncomfortable for putting my hands in them.

And boy am I glad that I did - the fit is absolutely AMAZING and super flattering. The sleeves aren't too poofy - they have just enough volume to make this piece look super modern. Much to my pleasant surprise, there are slits in the front, which make the midi length a little less conservative and a little more fun. All in all, this is a great slimming, comfy and super cute dress for work, a dinner date or out and about for everyday. Highly recommend!","July 8, 2019","True to Size"

I wished I could have worn a size down - the 16 was noticeably too big, especially in the sleeves and waist (bust was probably ok) but they didn't have the 14 available so I just went with it. I'm an hourglass figure (with an extra twenty minutes thrown in!) and these kinds of dresses aren't always flattering on me, but this one was just so lovely. Compliments all day. Fell below the knee a bit - which was perfect for my event - a bar mitzvah that included a service in a religious synagogue. Wanted to buy it, but it was a tad too expensive even with the discount.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKB1","RTR Customer","Perfect for a baby shower as well as dinner and drinks with friends!","I normally wear a 0,2, or 4, depending on the brand and fit of the dress (I have a very small waist- 24.5). After reading the reviews, some suggesting to size up 2 sizes, I (hesitantly) opted to order the 4 and the 6. The 4 fit perfectly and I loved how it looked for the baby shower I attended that morning. However, the material did wrinkle easily on the backside of the skirt, and it had zero give, so I opted to switch to the size 6 for dinner that night with friends. It was longer and looser in the waist (a little baggy almost) but was a little more ""relaxed"" fitting for a dinner and drinks, which I appreciated. In the picture above I am wearing the size 4. I would say this dress runs small for LK Bennett, as I own another dress in a UK 6/US 2 that fits me about the same. My husband had to zip it up at the top and commented how much he loved it- it's a really pretty dress! I paired it with black tights, suede heeled boots, a Burberry trench and black Chanel clutch.","February 12, 2018","Small"

Pink seersucker, so the funky shape is balanced by a preppy fabric. They came quite wrinkled so I had to actually iron them (I usually get away with just steaming) but once pressed the typical sitting-down wrinkles that developed didn’t bother me. Photo is after ironing and then a day of wearing to work. Fit: they are quite tight in the waist – I have a small waist and a larger hip area, so generally I am a 0/2 in most things and then often up-size to a 4 in pants, but here the hip is plenty full and the waist fit me perfectly (I’m pretty sure the 2 would have been too small in the waist for me).","August 3, 2018","Small"

The color is such a perfect shade of blue and the high waist is the perfect height. It had 4 buttons that were hidden below a flap instead of a zipper then a top 5th button that was exposed. Not bulky tho. The length was only about a half inch long and I'm 5'3 so I cuffed them once. The only reason they're getting 4 stars and I didn't buy them was because they stretched out so so much pretty quickly that by then of my work day the waist was no longer form fitting but had a gap and the knees were baggy and kind of sagging which was unexpected. If I rent them again I'd get the 25 in hopes that they'd be a little tight in the morning but then not as baggy throughout the day. I have a very athletic build with thick thighs so I never report back with baggy jeans.. if anything most ""girlfriend"" or ""mom"" jeans are fitted on me.","May 2, 2019","Everyday"

The pictures I took don't do it justice, and it didn't look like much on the hanger, I'm not sure I would've looked at it had I seen it in a store, but it's very flattering on. The bow on the chest is super cute, a little sexy but not too revealing (for my casual office anyway), and the mother of pearl buttons are beautiful. The fabric is thicker than I expected, and it's lined in a soft knit that almost feels like flannel -- not really meant for this July day, but great for my office where I'm usually cold. My measurements are 33-26-35, and the XS fits me perfectly. It's stretchy, and not tight on me, so it could probably accommodate slightly larger measurements too (more in the hips, less in the waist, and may become overly revealing with a large chest). It's a great length for my height too, short enough to be cute but long enough to not have any worries sitting down or bending over.

If I had the entire app's worth of choices, I would have picked something else for this occasion, but I had 3 slots open in my unlimited order and used them to make a cute outfit. With regard to this dress, the hanger had definitely stretched the shoulders out and it fit a little funny as a result. Otherwise, I liked the fit. The sweetheart neck was flattering and did not require fashion tape to cover my bra- which is very rare for me. The dress is fully lined with a very soft almost fleece material that feels very nice.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TYB110","Lara","Comfortable for work, and for cocktails.","This dress is all about the legs. The waist is not fitted and there is room to move (and slouch if you have to spend the day at a desk and want to just not think about what you're wearing). For a long-waisted (or busty) 5ft 8in person, you want to make sure you've got coverage under the dress on the bottom half. The interesting detail about the dress is the bottom panel, which is a separate panel held onto the dress with sturdy brushed-finish gold grommets and lacing. As you move around, there's a little intriguing peekaboo. So when I lift my arms, the grommets slide up several inches and potential show booty/crotch along that line of grommets. Tights or leggings are a good call, or maybe some black granny panties or boyshorts if you want bare legs. It's conservatively cut except for that racy grommet detailing.","November 9, 2018","True to Size"

The small fit me how I wanted-- an oversized fit, with enough room for bulky sweaters and hoodies. The material is thick and warm-- this was may go to jacket all month, perfect for fall weather! I was a little surprised by the pockets and the cuffs of the sleeves though because they are velcro. At first, this seemed odd to me but the pockets stayed closed and the velcro was unnoticeable and I did like changing the cuff size depending on if I was wearing bulky sweaters.

The cut is easy through the leg but nips you in perfectly at the waist. You can also adjust how tight the waist feels with buttons on each side, depending on how easy or structured you want to feel. The weight of the denim is substantial (worth the retail) but has a great wash so the drape of the silhouette still feels feminine.

It is slightly see-through, but I opted not to wear a slip. The front slit down the middle is still work appropriate as it only comes to the knees (just be careful when sitting/crossing the legs). I did find the V neck to be a bit low for work, so I pinned it an inch above the hook, but would probably be fine in any casual setting. The fabric is also stitched under the arm hole so even though the holes are big, you can't see in.

If I would have gotten this dress in a Medium, I would not have taken it off! Like other items by Elizabeth and James, I HIGHLY suggest going up a size! This dress does not have any stretch like typical denim pieces, but does have really long sleeve which is a total plus to me! I selected this dress for everyday, but you could totally dress it up with cute heels for a Spring/Summer brunch! This dress is great for the straight and narrow body type, but anyone with a little more in the bust... get 2 sizes up as your backup size.","February 10, 2017","Small"

This jacket, paired with Donna Morgan pink dress was so perfect. All night I received compliments and even won the costume contest. The jacket is large and not very form fitting, I ordered a medium even though I could have used the large for the sleeve length. The medium still felt very big. The material is thick and heavy, best to be worn for cooler but not freezing weather, it does not have a way to fasten close.","February 27, 2019","Large"

I don't mind over-sized things and the fit is pretty large, but the way the pockets fell was just a little too unflattering.

The fabric is a baby soft, thick, stretchy felted wool in a vibrant shade of deep fuchsia. Unfortunately, the sleeves, even when cuffed, were too long (you can see my right one rolled vs. left arm as-is in pic). Even worse was that the proportions on the lapels and shoulders just swam on my frame. I tried belting and it didn't help. I wish this came cut to petite sizing because I would have given anything to wear the coat, but just couldn't carry it without looking like a clown. Ah, well. Tall gals, enjoy it for the shorties.","December 15, 2018","Large"

I'd definitely size down (I'm a size 6 in shirts). Also, this one came pretty wrinkled and stayed pretty wrinkled. Since it's cinched at the waist with the tie, it's not as obvious.

It was quite itchy at first, but not unbearable. Love the color and am keeping it to wear again next weekend when the temperature drops a little more. Would definitely rent this again. One issue with it is the sleeves are so thick, I couldn't get any of my coats over them without squeezing my arms in.
