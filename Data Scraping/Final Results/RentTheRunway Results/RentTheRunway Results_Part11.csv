"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS126","Sally","Great dress!","Love the pockets and the material. It's thin, but has a good weight to it. I would suggest a strapless bra because the neckline is nice and wide.","August 3, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS126","Kimmie","Red rover, red rover, send this dress back over.","I would wear this dress every day if I could. The sleeves, the cut, the color! A great option for anyone who wants a bold and elegant look with traces of 50s vibes. The retro, oversized belt cinches the waist in just perfectly, and the midi cut (hit me at mid-calf, and I'm 5'4) flatters for any footwear. I tried both the 12, 14 and 16, and found the 14R to work best. It was flattering without being too tight. Heavier and well-made material, but still airy for any season to be honest.","July 31, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS126","Karla","Perfect dress","Man I love this dress. It's comfortable, flattering and has pockets. Great color. Not too low cut. It's probably better for tall people, im 5'10"" and the heavy sleeves tend to slide off my shoulders which would be extra problematic for shorter people. The waist sits right where it should (also a hard thing to find when you're tall) and it's very slimming. It fits pretty generously so you can go down a size. I'd buy this but it's around $600!","July 8, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS126","Eva","I felt and looked fabulous!","This dress generally fits well. It is not for someone who is super busty because you can't wear a bra with it.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","RTR Customer","Very pretty but extremely uncomfortable.","This dress is very cute but like many of the other reviews say, the ribbing hurts worse than any other dress I've ever worn. I was so uncomfortable even within an hour of wearing this we ended the date early so I could go home and change. It wasn't because the dress was too tight, this is just poor design. I usually am a size 0 but wore a 4 because I'm 6 months preggo. 4 fit just fine aside from God awful ribbing. Don't make my mistake and rent this because it's ""so cute"" and you think people are just being whiney about the ribbing. This dress stabs you!","March 25, 2020","True to Size"

The built in padding allowed me to go without wearing a bra. I gave it 4 stars because the wire from the padding was sticking out and poked into my sides all night. I'd rent it again, even with the wires though!","February 17, 2020","Formal Affair"

Somewhat uncomfortable on top bc of the boning of the dress. May work better for smaller bump, and might have been better with one size up.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Jordan","Beautiful colors!","This dress fit nicely over my 18 week baby bump and the colors are amazing in person. There was some wired ribbing that started poking out in both the size 4 and 6 that was quite uncomfortable/painful. The 6 fit me better but the wiring was poking out so badly I had to wear the 4. The 4 was comfortable enough, but by the end of the night started bugging me as well. As long as RTR fixes these maintenance issues, it's a great dress! Got lots of compliments!","September 21, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Elizabeth","Love, love, love.","Dress fit perfectly. I'm 5'5, so I imagine this would be even better on someone taller. Might be too long or hit you in the wrong spot if you're under 5'3. Great for bigger chested girls as well. The only issue were the hanger straps that kept popping out. Otherwise, photographed beautifully and fit even better.","August 27, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","RTR Customer","A beautiful summer wedding in Chicago. Gorgeous views and the perfect dress to fit the bill!","This dress is fun, flirty, and PERFECT for black tie/black tie optional wedding. My bust is a little smaller so the 4 was a tad looser on me, but I think a 2 would have been too tight. Gorgeous colors. The flowiness of the dress is so fun for the dance floor!","August 26, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Jamie","Perfect fit at 5 months pregnant","I sized up 1 size because I was 5 months pregnant when wearing this dress, otherwise I would say it runs TTS. I absolutely loved the red and pink colors, and didn't want to take it off at the end of the night! I'm always nervous about long or tea-length dresses given my height (5'1""), but this length was perfect (unfortunately, I don't have a full length pic). I highly recommend.","August 6, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Rachel","OBSESSED WITH THIS DRESS","Wow. It truly pained me to return this dress. I almost thought about re-wearing it to another wedding next weekend because it was THAT great. I have never had so many compliments! I'm 5'3"" and 200lbs so and normally wear a 14/16 so I was nervous this wouldn't fit, but it fit like a glove! If you're big chested (like me) you don't need to wear a bra. It flowed perfectly down over my hips and was super flattering with a tan. 11/10 recommend!","August 5, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Sylvie","Great color!","This dress is on the longer side for petite folks. I was at the end of my first trimester and had to go 2 sizes up from my original size as this fabric really doesn't have much give. Still a lovely dress and I received tons of compliments!","July 31, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Katherine","Wish I would have gotten the correct size!","I wore this to a friend's engagement party. Very cute dress, but unfortunately my usual size was unavailable at shipping time. Was able to fit into the size down, but was not as comfortable as I would have been in my true size. Lovely colors and fabric. Easy to dress up or down and boning in dress makes it secure to wear.","July 30, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Ashley","Show-stopping party dress!","I really loved this dress. I ordered a size up from my usual size (my usual size was not available), and the dress was just a little big. It did not wrinkle in transit (I didn't need to steam it at all) ‚Äì and it was long enough for me. This is a great option for tall women! It's true the dress hanger straps poked out a couple of times throughout the evening, but it was not a major hassle at all. Great dress!","July 29, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Gina","Big hit!","This dress was beautiful and super flattering. Got tons of compliments all night. I would suggest taping down the straps as they do tend to pop out a lot. It was a little lose up top on me but a strapless bra worked perfect to make it snug.","July 20, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","RTR Customer","Great maternity option","I was 6 months pregnant at the time and 2 sizes up from my normal fit well. I didn‚Äôt wear a bra because the build in cups felt secure enough despite my DDD‚Äôs. Two small negatives - the clasp on the built in bra fell off after I tried the dress on the first time but I was able to sew it back on, and the ribbing was poking out of the fabric and into my ribs in a few spots. Overall, I got a lot of compliments on the dress and it fit well.","July 18, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Nikki","Perfection in a party dress!","Rented this dress for a bat mitzvah and needed something that would be comfy and forgiving of an ever-growing 2nd trimester baby bump. My pre-baby size was a 6 or 8, but this pregnancy has tripled the size of my assets, so size 12 was the winner at this point to get it zipped up. This dress is so fun, flowy and super comfortable. I received compliments all night on the style and color - it really pops! Probably could have gone bra-less pre-pregnancy because of the ruffle over the chest, but did need a strapless bra. Love a dress that I don't have to hike up all night and this one stayed where it was supposed to. I'd definitely rent this again and highly recommend to other mamas to be. (This is not a maternity dress, but is a great option for a bump)","July 16, 2019","True to Size"

I also didn't like the flap and thought it was overwhelming. I tucked it into the top pretty easily and loved how it looked. Got compliments all night on the dress. Super flirty","July 16, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Ashley","So fun for a summer wedding!","This dress was simply amazing and one of my all time favorite rentals! It was perfect for a semi-formal summer wedding and I received compliment after compliment. It fit like a glove and was true to size. I'm a B cup and it fit very snuggly at the top which I definitely appreciated, as I didn't have to worry about it falling down even once the entire night. No bra needed as it has a structured bodice with some padding. Rent this dress! You won't be disappointed!","July 15, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID12","Emily","Beautiful and easy to dance in","This dress runs a little bit on the large side because it's only fitted in the chest. I usually wear a size 2 and I got a 0 as a backup. Here's my advice: size down for your backup size, and even if it feels really tight in the chest, wear it around at home for a couple of hours and see if it starts to stretch. I wore the larger size to the wedding, and because of the material, I found it sliding down from time to time. (You can see in the picture it rode down a little low on me). The material isn't stretchy, but it seemed to get a little bit looser throughout a night of dancing. Because of the structure of the dress I didn't need a strapless bra, but a bra might have kept the larger size from sliding down. I'd recommend trying it on with and without a bra. Overall I would definitely recommend this dress; it's easy to wear and would look good on a wide variety of body types.","June 29, 2019","True to Size"

The boning in the dress helped keep the dress up and I was able to go bra-less . The length is ankle length on me since I'm only 5'1"" but I still love how it looked.

The natural fabric kept me cool and since there's some crinkling in the fabric, I didn't need to iron it (just kept it in the shower for a quick steam). The dress is lightly lined and has pockets!

I've never had more compliments on anything I've worn other than maybe my own wedding dress. I wore it to a wedding as wife of the best man. Some of the highlights of the nonstop compliments I got were that I looked like an evil villain... but the villains always dress the best, a little boy who asked if I was a princess too (in addition to the bride), a Charlie's angel, a mafia wife who's secretly the real boss, and that I was ""pushing the Dynasty vibe in the best possible way"". It fits true to size, the legs are cut a little jogger style so they'll fit more athletic thighs, and the subtle wood grain texture is a nice touch. For a muddy outdoor ceremony I appreciated the ankle length; I wore it with ankle boots which maybe wasn't the best look, but it wasn't too bad and worked for the weather.","January 20, 2020","True to Size"

If you are a small 6 then i think this would fit best. The top is probably made for a larger chest but the design and lace detail makes it so it is not noticeable at all if it isn't quite as tight on top.

I didn't need a bra (although I wore one) and NO SPANX because of the waist and flare of the skirt. It fit beautifully across the top so I wasn't tugging it up all night (I'm a 36C but they're flat C's because...breastfed 3 babies in the last 5 years). The length was perfect - I'm 5'4"" and wore about 2.5-inch heels. It had pockets too, which was great for carrying my phone around. I wore big chunky pink/coral earrings that matched the flowers and no necklace. I wasn't too hot or too cold (my event was indoors in March).

Felt completely comfortable wearing it, top never slipped down (I'm a 36A/B). Loved the pockets, the high/low hemline, the material. FWIW, the material is a bit heavy, a brocade-like fabric, so it doesn't lie flat. I was fine with that but someone else may not expect or want that look.

Its difficult to find things that are flattering without being bodycon or tight fitting, or that even fit right! This dress was perfect. It fit so well, I read most of the reviews to determine my size. I teeter between an 8 and 10, and the 8 was perfect. Occasionally, I had to pull the top up, but the fabric had a nice weight to it and my bust is on the smaller size compared to my height, shape, etc....so I expected it. The high low was awesome, made it unique compared to others at the event. I received so many compliments! The pockets were a selling point. So many times I go to events and you have a phone and a drink and sometimes a purse or a wallet in hand and its too much. These were deep, sturdy pockets....loved them. Only negative, towards the end of the night a wire sticking out of the bodice on the inside started to impale me. I noticed it the minute I put the dress on but figured it wouldn't cause too many issues and it didn't unless I sat a certain wait or towards the end of the night.

This was the PERFECT option! Looked so fancy, and did not drag the ground in the back (though I *did* wear 3.5ish"" heels).

I wore the 6R to the wedding but I wore Spanx with it to give my stomach the flattest look possible because this dress hugs you tightly up top. If you have a smaller frame, you might be a better fit for this dress. My shoulder strap kept coming undone too and it was all the way lose too. The zipper is super cheaply made, the kind wear it gets stuck when the fabric changes and you're afraid the zipper will break off if you keep tugging. I tried the dress on right before vaca (before travelling, the new food in my body etc) and it was still like ""Ah this is weirdly tight up top"".

Running small with no stretch, I recommend wearing size up for your primary size. The style is fitted at the midsection and roomy at the hips. It works best for all cups. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear either a nubra or no bra since the back is low. At 5'5"", the length hit mid calf on me. I loved the soft & feminine quality of this dress and can't wait to wear it to an event! Pair with a strappy sandal or heel to complete your outfit!","January 31, 2019","Small"

This piece is ultra feminine and a true head-turner. Although fitting true to size in both the waist and length, I felt the bust area has more fabric than needed. The garment has no stretch but the placement of the buttons truly flatters any hourglass figure. Overall - Would rent again.","July 11, 2018","True to Size"

I am loving the print and these amazing colors, which are a little bit more vibrant in person. The puffy sleeves are so fashion forward. It fits true to size with comfortable room in the top and the hips just cinched tight in the waist. This works great with a standard bra. I'm only 5'3 and it was about mid-thigh length on me, so it may be more mini-length on taller women. Such a fresh and fun look, I love it.","June 26, 2018","True to Size"

I loved the print and although the sleeves were a little poofier than I anticipated I still really like it. The only issue is that is gaped a bit in the front which I think could have been fixed by going up a size (large instead of medium). You can't really see the gaping in the picture but I couldn't wear the dress to the event I intended because it showed too much cleavage and wouldn't lay right.","June 13, 2018","True to Size"

My reason for 4 instead of 5 stars, though, is the fabric. I wore it on a summer day in NY with heat and humidity (not my best choice) and the fabric didn't breathe at all.

The dress is on the longer side (hits below the knees) - I'm 5'5.5"". I'm planning on wearing this for Christmas Eve with some black booties. This dress has A LOT of stretch, so I would actually size down. I had tried on the top version in navy blue of this in the NYC Flagship store which fit fine but the material tends to roll/bunch up, because it is very stretchy. It is a forgiving material but still hugs your curves enough that you it's better with spanx underneath. Great holiday dress but you'll definitely need to wear pasties as it won't look good with the open back (unless you have a racerback with lace detail which may look good).","December 21, 2019","Large"

If you're not seated or standing with great posture it can sag a tad in the underarm area. If you fill out with a bigger chest, that may help. That wasn't an option for me.

The neckline, the cutout back, the color, the bodycon shape. But it just didn't work on me. The shoulders had strange bunches at the neckline, the back wouldn't hang straight no matter how I tied and reties the bow and the square shape of the cutout showed my panties when I moved. I couldn't make my DD breasts look good in it. I am 5'4"", 123 pounds, with an hourglass shape. It fit me like a glove, so the sizing was right.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BDT1","Lilibeth","Flirty & classy at a scholarship program anniversary!","My body type: I'm 5'0"", 145 lbs, and about 50% legs/50% torso. I carry extra weight around my waist after having 2 kids via c-section. This makes dresses look very different on me vs. the models. I wore this to a cocktail party for the 30th anniversary of the scholarship program he graduated from. This dress fit the bill. PROS: The lacy, woven part is *not* itchy in the slightest and this is something I usually struggle with because I have eczema. The zipper didn't stick at all, which is a big thing for me since I have to use shapewear and things are often snug in the midsection. The skirt was very short on the model but since I was wearing a L and I'm short, it hit me just above the knee. CONS: The top isn't made for people with shorter torsos. It could be because I was wearing a bigger size but if I were more talented, I would've have cinched the top by the shoulders (as shown in the 3rd picture). Overall, I'd definitely rent again and I would even buy if I managed to lose a little around the middle.","June 3, 2019","True to Size"

And I fell in love. I found it to be a perfect and flattering fit for someone of my height. I was worried about the length being too short, but it was a totally appropriate length for me, and I even ended up wearing instead of another more colorful dress to a wedding shower. It's a multi-season dress. It has a 1960's flair to it. And despite all the frills, it doesn't feel overly girly. I'm not a big ""sleeves"" person, I hate feeling restricted around the arms, but found the short sleeves to be comfortable.","April 17, 2019","True to Size"

I'm only 5'2 so the shorter front was perfect for me to walk easily without having to hold up my dress and a little train-look (b/c I'm short) to give it the perfect touch for our special day. Given the chance I would have purchased this dress. Be aware that, if you are short in the shoulder area, the straps ARE NOT adjustable BUT I used a pretty ribbon and tied the straps together at the neck which allowed less cleavage and a nice lift (to the girls) so I didn't need to wear a bra - NO COMPLAINTS :) Thank you Rent the Runway - your business model ROCKS!","September 8, 2019","True to Size"

I received so many compliments and LOVED the pickets-obviously. I will say, however, that I wish there were cups or more form for the boobs. Without a bra it didn't look great because they looked squished, but because it's cut so low it wasn't ideal to wear a bra with it either. I wore a bra, ultimately, which was the best option but also meant I constantly checking to make sure you couldn't see it in photos, etc. Regardless, loved this dress and would wear again for sure.","July 31, 2019","Wedding"

They selected this for me and I would never have picked it for myself, which just goes to show that sometimes we need to try something new as it was completely stunning in person. It was too light in color for the formal wedding I was attending in SF at night but I would happily rent this for a different event.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM521","Melissa","Fantastic for a wedding in France","The comments were so helpful and accurate. This dress is gorgeous, the pockets are amazing, the cut of the skirt both dramatic and romantic / so pretty -- if you can make the sizing work. I normally wear a 4 but am quite petite up top with hips. I took advice from other comments to size down to a 2, and while the straps were still long and the dress was a bit tight to zip up, worked well. Fit issues: (I'm 5'2"" a 34B and 135lbs) per other comments, a racer back adapter would have been helpful for comfort and piece of mind for the long straps, but I was ok with out it. I did wish I had brought fashion tape. The cut of the bodice is quite wide - part of the drama of the simple top, and a little tape would go a long way to keeping everything just so when sitting / getting in and out of cars / just keeping you from having to adjust or check. The full skirt was VERY full, so even though I had to squeeze into the top, there was more than enough room through the skirt (despite me being quite hippy). As another commented noted, it's quite long. It just grazed the floor for me in heels, I made it work but had to watch the hem in crowds. The pockets were big! You could hold a phone and lipstick with only minor effect on the silhouette - and so practical. I thought it was fun and romantic and dramatic enough for a big, destination wedding and got a number of compliments. I had a great experience wth the dress.","July 14, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM521","Christie","This dress is perfect for a summer wedding at anytime of the day!","This dress was gorgeous! I received many compliments.

I wore a size 4 and I‚Äôm 128lbs -the area below the breast was a bit loose but maybe because I‚Äôm small on that area of my torso. I didn‚Äôt wear a bra and although I read the reviews about how revealing this dress was- guess what? It was indeed revealing! Not conservative at all and I still loved it. I felt sexy and classy all at the same time. My bra size is 32D or DD and the girls were definitely noticeable. The dress even gave me a lift and kept them in place. So did the straps. The pockets were to die for! I wish I could keep this dress. It felt a bit heavy but the fabric and quality are amazing! I paired it with navy heels/sandals and a navy purse as my husband was wearing a navy suit and the dress has a very faint tint of blue.","July 9, 2019","True to Size"

It was a bit big, as I expected, but true to size. The fit was forgiving and not falling off/down, as long as I kept good posture! The straps were quite long, so I tacked them up, which also helped give it a better fit and the length was just right for a 3.5‚Äù-4‚Äù heel. The dress was lightweight making it easy to move freely and stay cool. The only potential drawback is that if you have really sensitive skin, the fabric of the bodice is a bit itchy; not an issue for your torso/chest itself (it‚Äôs lined there) but the straps are of the same material so arms/shoulders could be a concern.","June 26, 2019","True to Size"

I looked quite busty in the dress, probably because I am a little heavier (10lb) right now than usual. Still, I owned the ""girls"" and wore a dainty crystal long necklace to deflect and honestly the compliments were all night long.

It was VERY small in the waist, and because I sized up to a 6 based on reviews, the bust was a bit roomy/ yet super low cut so I wore a cami. Hope this is helpful.

It's kind of like a trench coat material which is unique for this type of cut. Despite its beauty I didn't feel this dress was very functional. Sitting down was nearly impossible because the slit opened right up.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC104","Gabrielle","I had to run out to store and buy a new dress and made it back just before the ceremony.","I rented this for a Summer wedding ceremony in a church. I rented 2 sizes, 4R and 6R. I am 5'7"" and weigh 125lbs. I wear a BC cup bra. I do have broad shoulders so I should be able to wear this dress. Depending on The cut and material of the dress, I knew one had to fit me. Boy was I wrong. The dress wrapped around or was suppose to wrap around and button on the inside at the waist, then wrap and tie bow at hip. I could not get either size to button. I tugged at the dress, I raised it and lowered it to the thinnest part of my waist and tried the thinnest part of my rib area, my stomach...just trying to get the button to meet the button hole. Both sizes were too small and couldn't get the inside side button to reach buttonhole. I was at least 5 inches apart from the hole. There was no way anyone's waist was that tiny and their chest and breast were that voluminous and wide. The dress def was not cut for a size 4R or 6R. Even the wrap around part across the chest/boob area was too far apart. The material didn't close enough to criss cross to cover your chest/ boobs. It crossed and met at the belly button area exposing your entire chest/boob area and to underarms. It was very strange. I never had a dress fit like that and I've worn plenty of wrap style dresses. If you lay the dress out and button it and tie the bow, you will see the disproportionate fit of the teeny waist and the wide shoulders.","August 29, 2019","Wedding"

I found it very difficult to find an even way of closing the tie, that complemented my d√©colletage. I wore it out to dinner while on vacation. It's a beautiful color but I did have to make sure that my posture never lapsed, otherwise other guests would have gotten a show. I wrote that it runs true to size because there wasn't a ""Runs Weird to Size"" option.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC104","Danielle","Perfect for a hot outdoor wedding!","I loved the fabric of this dress, as others have said. The linen blend helps keep things cool, but also has a great stretch to it. I ironed it briefly before I put it on and it was super easy to smooth out. The neckline is definitely low, even with some creative safety pinning. Not the most modest, but okay for my occasion. I was able to wear a normal bra, and the cut at the arms allows for a large range of motion and also ensures you won't have sweaty pit stains. Also, pockets. I would totally buy this dress!","July 21, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC104","Ashley","Gorgeous color!","The fabric is a little more like a linen bag - like tougher and less flowy than I expected.

The colors and details look gorgeous in real life. I wore it with some black suede booties. Anyways, I had to write a review because I can't wait to rent this dress again. It's sexy for date/girls night but still classy enough to wear to a work function. I highly recommend!","February 10, 2020","True to Size"

It was super silky, stretchy, and comfortable; you hardly feel like you're wearing anything! You can also wear a regular bra, which is always a nice thing. Even though you're covered up top-wise, the rouched mini skirt gives it a very sexy feel. Easy to walk, dance, sit in, all around awesome rental!","January 21, 2020","True to Size"

The sleeves are puffy and boxy like which I adored since it gave the dress great character. It is on the shorter side for length so one must feel comfortable with showing some leg (as short as a mini skirt). Would even consider buying. Excellent choice!","January 1, 2020","Party"

I unfortunately didn't get any full body photos from the night, but you can see a close up of the pattern in this photo. The material is a little heavy but doesn't look it. It's perfect for a black tie optional wedding in the summer or any other fancy spring/summer event. My one comment is that the straps fell down pretty frequently, but I didn't mind much. I am usually a 2 or 4 in dresses and the 2 fit well, so I would definitely say this dress is true to size.

I would recommend sizing up at least one size (I sized up one for my regular size and two for my backup and while both fit I wore the back up). The pockets are in the front and if it is too fitted you can see the lining through the fabric which looks a little strange. Other than that it was perfect!","August 12, 2019","Small"

I had to size up because my torso was a bit long for the 2, and it gave me a full rear to front wedgie lol. It's a good thing I had heels because even though I'm tall, it was on the floor as I was standing barefoot! 4 stars for the fact that I still had a small wedgie issue which I fidgeted with a few times while standing/sitting.

I received a ton of compliments but, ""That jumpsuit is everything!"" was the one that really summed it up. Comfortable and effortless, this outfit was flawless, and the color is just gorgeous. The cut would require bustier girls to wear some sort of strapless support I believe, but the material is substantial enough that I didn't feel that it was necessary to wear a bra (I'm a 34B).

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THF14","Kimberly","Fun, if a bit frivolous for work.","Very cute dress. I rented my normal size, which fit snugly where the waist is cinched in below the bodice. It was fine for me, but people who like a looser fit might want to consider sizing up. The higher part of the hemline fell about two inches above my knees, and the lower part just past the knees. The fabric is thin, so I wore dark tights with it. Knee high boots rocked the look. I did have a few quibbles with the fit. I hadn't realized that there was a deep keyhole neckline, so had to wear a cami under it to make it work appropriate. And since the waist is cinched in so tightly, the extra material from the bodice just hung there right below the chest. I thought it was a bit frivolous for my professional office, but wore it on a Friday when I didn't have any client meetings scheduled, with a blazer over it to tone it down a bit.

The material is very thick and stiff, which makes the super long sleeves really awkward. You would have to scrunch the arms to find your hands and then you'd have a weird balloon mid-arm. It's also so low, you'd definitely have to wear a cami. I don't think fashion tape would be strong enough for the material.

I was worried about the off the shoulder look because my shoulders are fairly wide but with a few adjustments it ended up being very cute.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN193","Kaitlin","This is a showstopper","This top is absolutely stunning and really elevates a casual outfit. I wore it to a bachelorette celebration - dinner at a nice restaurant followed by (wait for it) beer pong reservations at a cool little ping pong bar. Paired with dark wash jeans and black wedges, this was the perfect outfit to suit both occasions. The cons all have to do with the fit - it runs very small and I ordered up a size and would have liked even more room. I could not get it on by myself because it has a side zip and had that annoying thing where it won't go over the seam. It was also too large at the top - we had to tie the neck ribbon to make it work, otherwise it dangled awkwardly (I believe this is because I am not busty). It's not the most comfortable top because of where the boning stops right at the waist - bending over wasn't fun and sitting required some delicate adjustments. All that said, it's truly beautiful enough for me to put up with the cons again and again, hence the five stars.","September 11, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DLF11","RTR Customer","Liked the looser style though it does run big. Pleats were not in my dress which was disappointing.","Definitely runs large and would've sized down if I had the option. The straps are a little long and I had to use fashion tape to make sure it wasn't exposing too much when I moved around/bent over. My biggest issue with the dress is mine came with all the pleats undone. You could see the hint of pleats that once were, but it looked like a regular but kind of wrinkled skirt bottom which took away a large part of the refinement of the dress for me. The pleats are a key part of the style of the dress. Unpleated, it also had more material and made the bottom bulky. I would have had another one sent if I had had the time. The tie waist does allow a certain amount to customize the fit and it is very comfortable with the looser style. It hit me maybe 5 or 6 inches above the ankle. Would rent again if I could guarantee the dress would come with the pleats pressed like they should've been.","September 28, 2019","Large"

I dressed it up with soft pink heels for the office and will be wearing it with bright white sneakers this weekend. If you don't take yourself too seriously and want to try out one of the designers of the moment - this skirt is for you! I have a small waist and wider hips/thighs, so I'm glad I opted for the medium. The small might've worked, but the medium isn't tight anywhere.","September 27, 2019","Work"

You really need a bodysuit to wear with this otherwise the fabric from anything tucked in will bunch and you will see it.","September 11, 2019","True to Size"

While it fit in the hips and waist it was super baggy and big in the top area (as evidence by my bra showing). The color was alright- a little too orange for my taste.

Giant belt loops so it'd look weird with no belt and it's bright orange so black or brown would look like Halloween or Candy Corn. Zero response for over a week from multiple reach outs to RTR customer service and ultimately returned without wearing. Such a bummer as the color is so fun!","August 6, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC101","Lindsay","So many compliments","The color is beautiful. I received so many compliments at an evening spring party. I could have actually worn the size smaller as well so I guess it runs slightly large. Some reviews said the fabric is thin, and it is thin, but high quality. It's a typical silk dress weight (like a classic Vince silk top). RTR has put a half slip in it to add an extra layer and that helps. The wrap top almost shows too much, so I debated wearing a chunky necklace or scarf, but decided it would distract from the beauty of the dress. Great dress and experience.","April 13, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC101","Leticia","I loved thus dress so much, but Wayyy too much cleavage for me","I SO wanted this dress to work out. The color is phenomenal! If you've got curvier hips, it's more of a mermaid style skirt than on the model. It has pockets! The sleeves are a perfect length and width. The buttons are a little tricky, especially the front one but i was really pushing it. I squeezed into the 12 i was sent but a 14 would've been more comfortable in the waist. The wrap part of the chest opened way too much and was too revealing for me. Unless you're comfortable with lots of cleavage, wouldn't recommend this dress for anyone larger than a C cup. I could've worn an tank underneath but I didn't want to compromise the style of the dress. It really is a stunner, and I'm still sad I couldn't make it work for me.","March 15, 2019","Wedding"

Very lovely material but there's a piece of fabric that's stitched on the shoulder pads to make the sleeves puffy and the seam of this fabric is pretty scratchy.

It's made of a satiny fabric and feels so luxurious on. One drawback is the chest area: it made my size 34Bs look like DDs! So, if you're busty: beware. For some reason the cut enhances bust size dramatically. Also- the sleeves are 3/4 length which I didn't realize until I tried the dress on. Overall, I liked the dress enough but only wore 2 time.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AX159","Lauren","Beautiful, structural, statement ruffle!","I wore this dress for a New Year's Eve party and had so much fun wearing it! The statement ruffle around the neckline/sleeves was so bold and flirty, and I felt really good in the dress! There is corset style boning in the bodice of the dress, but this is maybe the first time ever I wasn't being poked and prodded by boning in a structured dress like this. The material of the dress is a little slick (not a woven material). At first I wasn't sure how I'd like it, but it ended up being flattering, and it meant I could pair a glitter covered Kate Spade cross body and not suffer any pilling from contact with the dress. I would warn that the dress does run small. I'm a true hourglass, and a size 8-10. The XL was snug on me through my mid-section, but not uncomfortable. Because I'm only 5'2"" with a short midriff, the top/sleeves felt a little loose, but were so structured with the ruffle that you can't tell they aren't snuggly anchored on my shoulders/arms. I would caution too, that the dress is short in the front. It was perfect for standing and walking around at a cocktail party, but gets pretty short when sitting down (I positioned my skirt on my lap when I found myself sitting).","January 3, 2020","Party"

Def not made for dancing and if you plan on sitting at all have a jacket to drape over your lap. (Seriously.) The front is dangerously short but stays put while standing/walking. The hemline dips beautifully in the back for plenty coverage. I'm a small but the medium was perfect. Braless and flawless friendly.","October 27, 2019","Party"

The fit of this dress is amazing, it has a wire corset built in for structure, and yet it's really comfortable and offers quite a bit of movement and room.

It's so flowly on the bottom, I couldn't help but spin and twirl and the rifhr was snug and sexy. 110% would rent again and would urge anyone considering it to rent.","November 19, 2019","Formal Affair"

Highly recommended!","September 5, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS143","Rayleen","Fun, sexy and flattering!!!","Wore this for my 20th wedding Karaoke party. I felt so great in it, I was comfortable singing and dancing all night long. I received so many compliments, the cut out on the sides and back was super sexy. At the same time the dress was very flattering. The material is a little heavier than I expected but I think that helped it hang smoothly and hide any bumps I wouldn't want anyone to see. The longer fabric sides are asymmetric, took me a minute to get used to them but added to the overall aesthetic of the dress. This was a rental love.","September 2, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS143","Amandah","Elegant Wedding Look","This wasn't my favorite RTR purchase of all time, but it was still was a fun enough look to wear. I thought it was going to be more ""sexy"" than ""elegant"" based solely on the photos, but even my date mentioned that he thought it cute that I was so ""covered up"" (haha). My only compliments were from older people, so that might say it all. However, the venue ended up being very stuffy and old-school, so it was kind of a random, unintentional win. I totally felt like some dark princess. The cutout isn't as large as it looks, it was just a tiny little opening on the side, and the dress was longer than I expected it to be (probably my own fault for not measuring). You can't wear a normal bra with this, the front cuts in a lot, so I just went without one. The clasp in the back digs into you, so you'll have to sit a few inches from the back of any chair. The material is a bit on the heavy side, which was a lot for a hot summer wedding (again, my bad for going with a long, black dress in the summer), but I've got to say: the bottom is very fun to twirl around in on the dance floor! I don't think I've ever twirled so much in my life (so, win). I didn't dislike it by any means, I think I just thought it was going to be more fun than it was. It was my first wedding with my new boyfriend and I wanted to ""wow"" him, and I don't think I really nailed it with this one.","July 3, 2019","True to Size"

It was a little tighter in the stomach area and was hoping it would be a little more empire waist to hide my stomach area. I did have a zipper issue where I could not get the top part to zip up once I had it on, after several attempts, I had to take the dress off and zip it up and then put my head and arms through.

I think the combination of both a zipped back and a wrap front made the overall shape so flattering. Wasn't too short and overall is the perfect romper if you're looking for a sun dress that's kicked up a notch. My only cons would be it wrinkles easily and is a bit complicated during trips to the bathroom but a small price to pay!

I'm smaller up top, so I needed a strapless bra to really fill it out, otherwise, there would have been some slight gapping at the top, but nothing that would have made the dress unwearable.

I love the sweetheart neckline paired with the oversized pouffy 80's sleeve - it really made a statement. My only complaint about this dress is that the fabric looked cheap in person.

Everywhere else fit fine, but the chest area is super tight with no give to the fabric. The material of the dress is pretty thin, so I don't feel like I would have been comfortable wearing it without some sort of a bra or padding which would have made it even tighter. I may try it again in a large, but not sure if that will do the trick or not. Unfortunately, I had to return it without wearing it.","July 29, 2019","Small"

The off the shoulder look stayed that way for the most part which is of course always a concern with off the shoulder dresses. There was a little cord to tighten it if you wanted to but you didn't really need it. It was very forgiving with stretchy top and some stretch in the waist. I find most Kate spade dresses and rompers run a bit large so for this brand I would say it's true to size however if you usually wear a medium dress you could probably easily wear a small in the dress as I did.

The waist and hip fit perfectly and booty area as well. I do have a smaller booty so if you have a larger one, you might want to size up. I thought it worked really well on my petite frame, and was pretty conservative for a bodycon dress in terms of the hemline. (If you‚Äôre taller it might be less so on you) I really liked the asymmetrical hemline as well. The bright red color was super nice. The only issue with the dress was the chest area‚ÄîI‚Äôm a size 32B with a smaller chest width in general and while it was doable, I had to use fashion tape to avoid having the strapless bra show. This is typically an issue for me with dresses that aren‚Äôt altered for my fit, though, so it wasn‚Äôt a big deal.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR134","Kelly","Beautiful colors and fabric, but way too revealing on top if you have big boobs","I loved the colors and feel of the material of this dress, but I didn't end up wearing it to the wedding I attended because I just couldn't figure out a way to make the exceptionally low and revealing neckline work for my 38DD boobs. I have an amazing WonderBra that was just covered up when the dress was worn naturally, but I had FULL-ON SIDE BOOB ACTION with that, and when you have big boobs, that look is a little less sophisticated than I was going for. The waistline was almost a little bit big for me (I'm ~45""-34""-47""), and if I cinched it tighter, I could cover a little more chest, but then the seams on the side were pulled forward along the hips and it ruined the straight lines on the side of the dress. The dress was also see-through and made from a relatively thin material, so I would have needed to wear a slip with it to cover up my underwear lines, as well as to protect in case of a blustery wind (since it's a wrap dress, there's always a danger of exposing too much). Truly a shame the neckline is so low and wide -- I'm a couple inches short-waisted, so that probably didn't help, either. I just couldn't make it work without a LOT of other accessories (I was even contemplating creating a faux neckline garment to wear underneath and pin in strategic places to cover additional area, but it was just too much). I want a lined version of this dress that has more fabric up top!","September 5, 2019","True to Size"

It looks like sexy little fishing lures on top of black silk chiffon. Yes it is short, but absolutely no shorter than it looks on the model. For me it was a little longer, as I am shorter.

The fabric also adds to the comfot as it was super light! The sleeves and the slit in the front add a nice touch with minimal effort in the accessory department.

The deep plunge would normally be great with my bust (not very big, just wide-set) but thin fabric without structure and thin legs was unflattering on me. I have athletic thighs (~24 inches) so the fabric clung to my upper leg and flapped around my shins...yikes. The plunge is very deep indeed, you'd need an undershirt for work.

The dress runs a little big, I am usually a 6 or 8, depending on the bust, I have small hips, so can't speak to how this would fit if you're more curvy there, but the Medium in this, which is a 6 in US sizes, fit like a glove. It's definitely midi length on me, but has 2 slits on the side, so didn't look too long. The material is very light with just a touch of stretch, it feels almost like a cotton lawn rather than synthetic, very breathable. So many compliments on this dress, if you're bosomy be prepared for acres of cleavage, but the dress is so sweet-looking that I never felt inappropriate. The sleeves have elastic and stayed off my shoulders and were no problem whatsoever, it's low in the back , but my strapless bra never showed, just a great summer dress.

But it held the whole night and was so comfortable to wear. Got so many compliments throughout the night. I'm 5'8"" and wore 3.5 inch heels and it was long enough. Without shoes it dragged. I did wear spandex under it because it was slightly see through when held up to the light. Would definitely recommend for a wedding or formal event.","October 2, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Lisa","Classic","Loved the classic look of this and would be easy to dress up or down. The way the wrap part worked ended up being a little more flashy than I felt comfortable, so I sized up.","September 25, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Naicie","Great dress!","It was my back up but my husband loved it. The fit was amazing. May need some double sided tape to keep the top in place. Length was good with 4 in heels.","September 22, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","RTR Customer","This dress is stunning!","Wrap dress fits true to size. I am a larger women's size 10, 36 DD. The XL dress fit great. I did not wear a bra with the dress, it just didn't work, and the slit is kinda on the high side...just a warning. I loved the dress, and got tons of compliments!","September 14, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","RTR Customer","wore this to a formal wedding","like others said I preferred to have a strip of wardrobe tape at the chest and a pin at the leg, it's a wrap dress and there is nothing stopping the wind from opening it right up LOL but you can have as much leg or as much cleavage as you want with the placement. Both the LR and the XLR fit I just tent to wear things bigger for comfort so I chose to wear the XLR. Lightweight material but not see through. Did wrinkle easily. It was so flattering, no shapewear was needed. Lots of compliments!! will rent again for sure!","September 3, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","RTR Customer","Such a fun dress!!","I loved this dress and wanted to keep it. It was fun and comfy all night. I had read other reviews about the fabric tape though so I got that and it's DEFINITELY necessary. I give this dress 5 stars with fabric tape. Seems pretty hard to manage without it. I also normally wear a small/medium, but wore a large in this just for some extra room and fabric for the wrap/slit.","September 2, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Allison","Beautiful dress!","This dress fit great and was very comfortable, I did have to use fabric tape on the top and bottom though as other reviews mentioned. The XS and S seemed very similar in size, but the S didn't lay right (bottom split of wrap wanted to come open very high on my legs) so I wore the XS. The dress is very prone to wrinkling so I steamed it after it arrived and again the day I wore it, after that it looked great!","August 26, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","RTR Customer","I looked great next to all my girlfriends!","I didn't realize that this was a wrap dress. The slit comes up very far and I ended up pinning it so it didn't fly open. Once it was pinned it looked great! It was bummer that I had to find pins in order to wear it. I'm not sure how this dress would be worn without pinning it since it just flies open.","August 21, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Amanda","Not worth the hassle","I ended up wearing this as a backup for a mountain wedding, with my other two rentals just not working. Being 5'2, this dress is LONG. Even with my tallest pair of shoes, it was dragging a bit. I loved the thought of this dress but it required so much fashion tape, and even with that I kept having to adjust it all night. I also felt self conscious of revealing myself in the chest or with the slit on the bottom while dancing. If you're going to be sitting still, this might work. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this.","August 8, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","RTR Customer","Love. Love. Love.","Amazing! Simply elegant, easy to adjust with wrap style. Had to use some fashion tape to keep from flying open - compliments all night.","August 5, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","RTR Customer","Dress worn to a hot and humid July wedding in PA.","A lovely, navy (true) wrap-dress. The material was light-weight but not see-through. I definitely needed fashion tape for the neckline and slit! Even with wearing 2-inch heels, the dress was slightly long on my 5'6"" frame. Overall, enjoyed wearing this dress!","July 23, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Jennifer","Easy to dress up or down!","Had to pin it but super cute! Loved the light fabric. Like everyone mentioned, wrinkles easily so ideal for when you're walking most the day. Easy to steam out wrinkles though!","July 21, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","RTR Customer","Perfect for a summer black tie wedding with the right amount of sexy","I feel like it runs a little small.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Amanda","Lovely","This dress was pretty great! I'm tall and wore 3"" heels and it was still a good length. I have a small chest so I went braless and didn't bother to pin it in place and it worked fine. I should have pinned the bottom together but forgot in my rush out the door; I'd definitely do that the next time. I somehow didn't realize the whole dress is fairly sheer, so note that, I guess? I wore this to an event where a 'look fancy-ish' dress code got interpreted as 'formal' by a lot of people, and I still fit in great.","July 9, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","RTR Customer","Love it","I bought tape like other reviewers suggested and it was perfect for the event.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Mj","Definitely need some fashion tape for this!","Like several other renters mention, this slit is very high. I'm 5'9 and consider myself to have long legs and the slit came all the way up to my underwear. I used some fashion tape to hold the fabric together. I also taped the top to my bra as it was gaping (I'm small chested though). Once everything was taped so I was decent, I loved it. I got several compliments and felt like a goddess with the skirt flowing behind me while I walked.","July 3, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Eva","Compliments galore!","This dress made me feel elegant and sexy, while also being appropriately formal for a wedding (the wedding photographer even told me I had the best dress at the wedding). As all of the other reviews said, fashion tape is absolutely necessary for both the top and bottom part of the dress, and I'd recommend bringing extra just in case. The fabric is pretty thin, so this dress is better for warmer venues.","June 19, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Mara","Fun, breezy dress!","I love love love this dress. Overall it does run a bit small, I tied the waist tight to get more leg coverage and pinned the skirt where it met in the front to keep from flashing everyone all day! Other reviewers said no bra but I found a plunge bra worked fine. It arrived a bit wrinkled so be ready to steam/iron before wearing. With all the said, it was such a fun, sexy dress that was super easy to wear and comfortable on a hot day! I will definitely rent this again.","June 13, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","RTR Customer","So flowy","I love this dress! I wore it to a wedding. I had to make some small adjustment though. I ended up wearing the larger back up size. I think wrap dresses on curvy figures tend to run small. Additionally, I ended up pinning about an inch up for chest so it wasn't overly revealing. I would definitely rent this dress again. I received compliments all night. Some reviews were concerned with the fabric. The dress is not silky but has more or a linen touch however the color is deep and the material is not see through so I didn't feel that the fabric made the dress any less than.","June 12, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","RTR Customer","Comfortable and classy!","I wore this for a family wedding. I sized up for the whole purpose of more coverage. I did pin the top. Sizing up allowed me not to have to worry about the slit. I danced freely the whole night! This dress is very comfortable and the material was perfect since the wedding was on a very warm day! #glamorous #wedding","June 5, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Erica","Perfect wedding guest dress!","This dress was perfect as a wedding guest! Pros: Super airy and comfortable. The length was long for me for my height but with heels it worked great. Cons: I had to use A LOT of fashion tape. Because it is a wrap dress, the top is open and I couldn't secure the strings tight enough to stay close which meant the slit in the middle was wide open. Thank goodness for fashion tape to secure the top section down and close up the middle slit from flashing everyone! Overall, really loved the dress and glad it worked out.","May 30, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF5","Cristal","Flattering but need multiple pins","In the end this dress is flattering but you will need to safety pin the slit and the neckline. The slit goes all the way up to your underwear, there's no way around not safety pinning it. The neckline could work for smaller chested women, but I am 34C and had to pin it as even wearing a plunging neckline bra didn't work. Also wrinkles very easily. Would be best for something you are on your feet for the majority of the time as sitting caused wrinkles almost instantly.","May 30, 2019","Small"

This dress covers everything and smooths out bumps nicely and is work appropriate but still a little sexy. I got compliments all night. No itchy sequins either.

I don't normally go for tight dresses but this one has a very nice thick fabric that made me feel secure and confident. I was also impressed with the length- I'm 6'0 tall and I didn't feel like my butt was hanging out! The sparkles are beautiful when they catch the light and it was the perfect festive dress. Taller/ bigger girls, this dress is super flattering. Rent it!!!","December 21, 2019","Party"

This dress is killer! It was very stretchy and comfortable but did require me to wear a backless and strapless sticky bra.... totally worth it. The sequin and pattern are really festive, the back is super sexy and the length was appropriate for an evening event, but I certainly wouldn't wear it to work.","December 2, 2019","Party"

It hugs in all the right places. Slightly too long of sleeves, but it wasn't that noticeable. I was able to wear a strapless bra with it and not see it with the V back.

I have a bigger bust for my size and this jumper still hung down way too low to go without a shirt underneath. I thought about pinning it but the seam is sewn in a V shape so trying to pin together, higher, didn't work out. Maybe if my torso was longer it would have fit my bust better. I needed to maybe pin at the shoulder seams and it would have worked without a shirt underneath.","March 5, 2020","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/STS82","Lauren","A bit short in the torso","Very cute jumpsuit--soft and thin fabric that kept it airy for the summer. No pockets. I wore it once to work, and once out with my husband. I liked that it has a lining on the inside since the fabric is so thin--unless you wear a seamless thong, you'd see a line without the lining. I had to wear something under it because the neckline was too low for a bra. I would have gone without one when we went out (not at work lol) but I didn't have any fashion tape. The problem I ran into was the midsection is too short so I was on the verge of having a wedgie the whole night haha. I have an average torso length, but if yours is on the shorter side maybe this was made for you!! Loved the fluttery sleeves.","May 26, 2019","Date"

However, the length of the torso was SHORT, and rode up *you know where* all day.

But will be renting again because I loved it!","May 3, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/STS82","Tamara","Better for short torso","I wanted to wear this so badly but my torso was too long, even though I'm not really long torsoed at all. The crotch part was giving me front and back wedgies and I couldn't comfortably lift my arms. I got a small (5'7"" 130lbs 34c) and a medium would have been way too big in the chest area.

It's not something I would have wanted to wear all day as the top is pretty loose and required a lot of taping. Rompers are harder for me anyway as I'm a small on top and medium on bottom so I knew it would run big on the top for me. The length was fine for me but as someone with a short torso I found the midsection to be shorter than expected, sitting for long times might not be ideal.","April 24, 2019","Party"

Love the color and classic, simple styling. The fabric is soft and cool. The V was a little low for my taste, so wore it with a cami. Because these are capris, the length was fine for me in the leg, but JUST fit in the torso. Anyone taller or with a long torso might have some fit issues there. Wrinkles a bit as you sit, but nothing big. I ordered the XLR because it was what was recommended for my size - usually a solid 10 - and it fit without being tight or too big.","March 22, 2019","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/STS82","Elle","Great way to make casual a little elevated","This fit really well. I ended up wearing the large, even though the medium fit, because it was easier to safety pin the vneck closed a bit higher.

I also found the hip/butt area to run small. I'm currently 140 lbs. post-baby and needed the large. The medium would have been very fitted on me and I wanted to wear it looser. The fabric was very light and comfy, and it worked surprisingly well on a hot summer day. I liked this jumpsuit a lot!","July 25, 2019","Other"

It was a cooler day, so I did not have to wear any type of jacket thanks to the long sleeves, yet the fabric was light enough that I did not get too warm during the reception/dancing. As someone who is in between sizes (4 and 6), I opted for size 6 due to the reviews on the ""tightness"" of the sleeves.

Sitting down was a little hilarious with the slit being so high, and of course my cousin got married on a windy day, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons with this dress, and I would 100% rent it again. I listened to the other reviews and ordered my size as well as the next one up, but ended up wearing the smaller one. It was a little snug in the arms, but not uncomfortably, and it's meant to be a bit fitted around the hips/chest. I felt like I was swimming in the next size up, and with the right spanx, my size fit me just fine.","May 30, 2019","Wedding"

It was subtle but sexy at the same time! I'm usually a small/medium but I got the large as a back up size. The large ended up fitting a lot better because it was slightly longer (I'm tall) and the skirt portion that zips up didn't have to stretch as much as in the medium, making it more flowy than body forming. The band in the back was way too big for both sizes, so make sure to bring safety pins. I forgot, so I used Bobby pins!","October 16, 2019","Wedding"

I thought it was going to be too short on me and not ""tasteful"" (since I am 5'8) but was it was just long enough for me to feel totally comfortable in. Ended up not wearing this for my original event, but had to wear it somewhere so ended up going to a movie and out to a bar afterward in it (super classy) :) :) My arms are a little bigger compared to my smaller body frame so the lace sleeves were slightly tight but ended up working out just fine. Also, the band around the waist buttons closed at the back (snap buttons) and this was too big so it was sagging, I ended up using boob tape to tape it to my back (at the center back) and it worked out! Actually used a fair amount of boob tape to secure everything but was super comfortable in it and didn't really worry about it too much throughout the night. This dress is definitely a show stopper!","June 3, 2019","True to Size"

It was just a tad too big esp the sleeve length. I tried to cuff them under but the fabric has no stretch and is slippery like crepe, so it didn't hold. I ended up cuffing over and had to mess with it all night to stay up. The color is vibrant and the shoulders add interest. Initially I wasn't sure about it.

The chest was large on me, but the shoulders fit and a smaller size probably wouldn't have. It also seemed kind of short when I tried it on, because the last button was at my belly button and then the last 1-2 inches of the shirt is open.

I know it is hard to have them in a variety of lengths, and I realize that this is a clothes sharing business, but I really wish that there were a tall(-ish) girl option.

The photo makes it look like an easy fitting dress. Maybe it was my curves that kept it from fitting, but the top was completely loose to the point of ridiculousness. There is no way to adjust the straps and with the low back and too long straps, there is just no way to keep the girls in place. I was really disappointed and returned it without wearing, the day after I received it.","July 30, 2019","True to Size"

It literally was falling off my body due to the size of the chest area and crazy long length of the straps. I tried to pin the straps but couldn't make it work due to the cut of the dress. No way you could wear this unless you're 6' tall or have enormous boobs (I'm 5'5"", 32C, 120 lbs).

I wasn't sure how formal or casual the event was, and this dress would be perfect for either. I was much more comfortable sizing up. The waist is snug and sits higher, which creates a weird bunch in the back. The larger size sat slightly lower on my waist, which makes the bust sit lower too (showing more cleavage if you have any - I don't!). It also felt a bit short to me, so the next size up gave me that extra length. Also, the ruffles seem to lay flat.","November 11, 2019","Party"

The fabric was light and held up well in the humidity, although after traveling in the suitcase the dress did need a lot of ironing prior to wearing. (Took me about 20-25 minutes to really do a good job with each ruffle layer) I did notice the very weird hump of material in the low back area. I solved it by just tucking it into the waist band. Overall the fit was perfect for me but I do have a big bra size and I filled out the front of the dress well. I'm not sure this dress would work for small breasts.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAB9","Lisa e","So fun, but unusual shape","I really liked this one although it‚Äôs definitely a more unusual silhouette. The shoulder pads, while not massive, do really make the dress structured and wide, and the rest of the dress is unfitted so it‚Äôs really sculptural in a way that is anti-body-conscious. The colors and print are really pretty, very bright, and it‚Äôs a comfortable dress. I wore it once to work as is, and I wore it with a wide belt to an 80s theme party. The shape you get from the big shoulder pads plus a cinched waist is VERY severe and very Designing Women, so if you are renting this with that as a backup plan to give it structure, just be aware that makes it look more costume-y, not less. One small quibble is that I wish the velvet bow was a little bigger ‚Äì if it were exaggerated it would have more purpose, but it‚Äôs so tiny as it is, it‚Äôs kind of like an afterthought.

This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works best for A-C cup. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this romper so you should wear a strapless bra, nubra or no bra due to the cut. At 5'0"", the length hit above mid-thigh length on me.

If you are considering renting this, just do it. You will not be disappointed. As the other reviewers have noted, the side zipper is a bit tricky, but all I did was swivel the zipper around to my stomach then zip it up there then swivel it back to the side and put the straps up. It wasn't bad at all. Honestly the zipper was not even an issue when you take the beauty of this dress into account.","August 14, 2019","Party"

LOL). I could not have gone down a size though. it was fit well in the ribcage but not roomy. I have smaller/moderate hips and there was some room there. the straps slipped a little but they are adjustable (like bra straps). I did not end up wearing this dress (as I chose one other) but I felt it was really beautiful. It's longer, so more length for ladies who want that. It's a subtle blush pink color - definitely not white or cream color. The fabric is very sturdy. The zipper was extremely tough to get up and down.","July 1, 2019","True to Size"

I ran lip balm along the zipper, turned the dress so the zipper was in the front of my body, zipped it up after numerous tries and twisted it around until it was positioned correctly.

The length and cut is so flattering. I carry a lot of weight in my lovehandles and hips, but this dress really minimized that. The straps were comfortable and the lace not itchy.

Also, I couldn't find the actual size chart on RTR. But I searched the internet for the Catherine deane dress for sale so that I could find the company's size chart and I went according to that, and with some help from pictures on RTR, I was able to select the perfect size. I agree the zipper was tricky but I've had worse on dresses. I also agree the color is completely different. I tried to choose pictures that show its true color. Either way, super cute dress, tons of compliments! No bra needed! Our rehearsal dinner was at a German beer house so I dressed it down by pairing it with a denim jacket and it was perfect.

I have a large chest, and felt fully supported with no bra, but I did have to get used to the fact that it's a lot more cleavage than I'm used to showing. Being short, I was worried a bit about the length but I wore it with pointy-toed flesh-colored heels and it wasn't an issue. I felt so pretty in this dress! The only thing I'd change would be the zipper - because the fabric is thick and there's the belt at the waist it was a wrestling match to get the zipper past the ribbon. The dress fit perfectly (the zipper wasn't straining) but the thickness of the fabric made it a three-person job to try to get the zipper all the way up.

The straps are thin so I wore a strapless bra so my bra straps wouldn't show, but I should have just worn a regular bra since my hair covered the straps anyway! I received so many compliments!

Cons: With this being an off the shoulder dress, the ""neck"" of the dress kept riding up making it not so off the shoulder. However, even when it sat over the shoulder, it was difficult to move my arms much. All in all this was a perfect dress to pair with my OTK boots during the cold winter months.

Very limited stretch + no zipper means it is a challenge to get the flattering waist band over your butt if you have one. But don't give up hope--just take it slow, inch by inch! After you put it on once it gets easier to get on and off (bathroom) without visibly stretching out. Attire for the party was ""going out clothes"" so I dressed it down with silver sneakers, hoops, and pulled my hair back. But, this piece could definitely be dressed up for cocktail with heels. Not hot, very breezy feel--worn in Alabama August and was fine! Jumpsuit works best with a barely there strapless bra and nude spanx shorts (it is semi sheer bc its knit).

I did like the color/design, but the material is thin/lightweight and the underskirt is very short. If i had tried to dance in it I surely would have exposed my underwear to the see-through lace part. Also I found the straps to be a bit tight, which is fine to hold in your chest and go without a bra, but could become uncomfortable after a long period. Also the way the fabric ruched/cinched leaves a little extra lace hanging if you look at it in certain angles. If you order the dress tight enough it shouldn't be an issue.

Fit perfectly and I was concerned I should ho a size up but the 8 fit great. I have an athletic booty and some me hips but the 8 worked well. Tip to designers, make adjustable straps, your customers will love it . Had some minor slippage with the straps but nothing too big. The print and material are lovely. The ruchet and varied length added some extra interest and fun.","June 9, 2019","Wedding"

The ruching detail is a really nice touch that made me feel comfortable eating, drinking, sitting etc all day for a wedding! Light material which was perfect for the hot weather. Would highly recommend for a summer wedding or event. I did have to slightly safety pin the straps as they were too long for me and not adjustable, and a little more low cut than I usually wear but felt covered and comfortable and didn't need to wear a bra.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS123","Nicole","RTR team review!","I enjoyed wearing this dress and got lots of compliments! It's actually a dark blue but looks black in photos. It runs a bit small if you are hourglass shaped - I'm usually a 2 but the slip was too tight so I went with the 4 (which I rented as a backup size). The 4 was loose in the waist but fit my top and bottom much better (2 was way too tight on my bum and the top wouldn't zip). The top is also revealing with not much ""room"" for a bra/support so I would be mindful of that. The slip is short so I think this would be trickier for taller ladies (I'm 5'2). The fabric that extends over the slip is pretty. Overall I really liked this dress!","May 20, 2019","Formal Affair"

It runs small. I'm typically a 4 and this was very tight especially through my waist and bust. It's low cut so I did not wear a bra which helped with the fit. There is no give in the fabric.

The slip underneath was snug, and didn't slide or move around at all. The straps are very pretty and very thin, but also didn't slide. I was walking a ton, and snagged the ends of the train a bit on my heels, but the fabric was durable.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM606","Kelly","Perfect dress for a formal summer wedding","I got so many compliments on this dress! I wore a low-cut wonderbra with it to make sure you couldn't see my bra, but I'm short-waisted and might have been able to get away with a regular bra otherwise. It was definitely a little busty on me (again, if you have regular proportions it would probably be better... things are always more low-cut on me than on models, and my boobs are big - 38DD/E), but that was fine for the wedding I attended in Liverpool. I was worried the ruffles would add extra volume and make me look bigger, but combined with the print, cut and color, they were actually very flattering. I normally wear a size 14 if a brand accommodates for more hourglass figures (I'm 5'6"" and my measurements are 45-34-47), but I sized up to a 16 for this to make room for my hips and boobs, and just tied the waist tighter with the attached fabric belt. It fit perfectly through the hips and chest, although it bunched a tiny bit in the back by the waist because, again, of how short-waisted I am. The pattern hid that, though. Length was great with a pair of 3"" stilettos, and I changed into 1"" slides later for dancing and was fine as well.","August 29, 2019","Small"

So classy and fun!","I ordered a 2 (could not zip the 2 up) and a 4 and the 4 fit perfectly. The dress was snug and I did wear Spanx underneath. If your spanx match your skin tone you can't seem them in the little cutout details around the waste. I loved this dress, it was classy and so much fun to wear and dance in. It didn't wrinkle which is a huge plus for marathon wedding days and everything stayed in place on the rowdy dance floor. The dress does have a deep V neckline so if you aren't comfortable with showing some cleavage this may not be the dress for you. I loved wearing it!!!!!","May 8, 2019","True to Size"

It was so comfortable and so fun for dancing. The plunging neckline was slightly loose but a tab of fashion tape helped close gaps. I highly recommend this dress.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK372","Alison","Fun print","I liked the style of this too, it felt long enough which is nice considering I am 5'9"" and sometimes tops are too short. The only negative is the neckline, it has a little ruffle around the edge at the top but it did not stay in place. It folded in so you could only see part it. I tried to iron it forward but that did not help. I think that the fabric needs to be thicker at the neckline. It's a minor design flaw but didn't stop me from wearing it twice, and most likely would rent it again.","December 12, 2019","Work"

The colors are beautiful and I didn't even notice the hardware at the neck until I received the dress. My only complaint is that the dress is sooo long, as other reviews have mentioned. I'm 5'7"" and was in platforms that gave me at least 3 inches and still felt like I should pick up the dress when I walked. I was worried about ruining such a beautiful dress as well as face planting ;) I received many compliments and felt fabulous!","September 23, 2019","Party"

I'm quite tall 5'11"", and the length w/ 4"" wedges was perfect. If you're looking for something short or form fitting- this is not the dress.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KF51","Crystal","A spring or summer dream!","I love this flowy maxi dress by KAUFMANFRANCO! Running large and loose, I recommend wearing a size down. This style has adjustable straps to secure the top fo the bust, then flowy throughout the bust midsection and hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra or strapless bra. At 5‚Äô4‚Äù, the length hit floor length on me. The pattern on the dress is absolutely lovely in person and the light flowy fabric is the perfect item for the beach or boat event you've been waiting to go to! Pair with nude or colorful heels and fun earrings to complete your outfit!","January 31, 2019","Large"

Stunning option and great for women of all sizes and body shapes!","December 1, 2018","Date"

It does have a low back, so you need an appropriate bra to wear underneath. The main drawback for most may be the length of the dress.

I wore a small regular, am 5' 7"" and 165 lbs and I probably would have preferred an XS. I had to wear 6"" shoes to get any clearance and it was still skirting the ground. Still, it's an exceptionally dramatic pattern, has pockets, and you can eat anything you want in it. Ended up not needing it and returned it unworn, but will rent again for sure.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KF51","Tracy","Beautiful and comfortable","This dress was very roomy, but looked great! It was a little too long, so I twisted/wrapped the neck portion under to pull up the skirt (this created extra bulk against my collar bone, which wasn't the most comfy), then I used the ties to wrap around my waist to give the dress more definition. It could also be worn loose for a more floaty look.","June 15, 2019","Date"

The length and v cut make it sexy on an hourglass shape but the ruching, sleeves and pattern made it seem like a fun, I'm-not-trying-to-be-sexy look. I wore it to a day party and a night out and it worked for both somehow (no shoe change needed). It seems small when you first put it on but it loosens up a little as you go through the day.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BSH34","Erin","Floaty, feminine and cool!","I rented this dress for a bohemian, rustic feeling outdoor wedding on a lake in Vermont, on a day that turned out to be 97 degrees in the shade...and I felt cool, elegant and ethereal throughout the entire day! Some things that should be noted: #1 This dress runs small. I am 5'10"", 140 lbs, 34D/C bust and I have a small rib cage for my height. I normally wear a 6 or sometimes a 4, so I was fairly sure the 1L (small-long) would fit- wrong! I got lucky because the 2L (medium-king) fit absolutely perfectly. The 1L (small-long) felt like it was suffocating me around my rib cage and the fabric was tight across the bustline. The band below the bust hits directly at the rib cage (it's almost an empire waist) so knowing how this area fits is important #2 The long is REALLY long (which I loved but maybe some people won't). I'm 5'10"" and with 3.5"" heels that puts me over 6'1"" and the hem still lightly touched the ground. #3 If you rent this dress make sure you have a steamer. Both sizes arrived extremely wrinkled and crinkled. The wrinkles steamed out easily, but had I not had a steamer the dress would not have had the gorgeous floaty effect that it did and would have looked much less expensive. An iron won't cut it with this fabric. #4 The attached slip-liner is a bright blue color and it kept peeking out from the front slit. I found it mildly annoying but if I rent it again I'll use double-sided tape to keep it in place. #5 The fabric is almost completely sheer, hence the need for the attached blue slip. I mention the sheerness because you'll need to wear a bra that is as close to your skin color as possible if you don't want it to be seen. The attached blue slip straps are very skinny and they won't cover the width of a bra strap. #6 if you look at the second photo you'll see that the metallic embroidered diamond shapes are both silver and gold which allow for some nice jewelry options. Overall, It was an absolute pleasure to wear this dress. I felt serene and soft and feminine for the whole hot day and I look forward to renting it again!","July 22, 2019","Wedding"

The waist portion was fine. This is a 12 for a tall, slender and smaller busted woman. Not a curvy 12.

Cons- no real cons, just some fit issues: needed a helper since the zipper was a little difficult to get past the velvet waistband each time but once it was past that the rest zipped easily. I rented the 8L (I'm 5'7.5"") but wound up wearing 2"" heels for comfort and there was a bit of extra fabric puddling all around me- not so much that I ever tripped or stepped on it, and I actually loved the way it looked, I just had to pick up the skirt a bit going up steps.","February 12, 2019","Formal Affair"

Shorter gals, you'll definitely need to wear heels with this one. The straps are adjustable (a fun surprise) but I found that to keep the top high enough where it wasn't showing too much cleavage, I had to tighten them to where it was a little uncomfortable under my arms. They did stay put, though! Nothing slipped or moved once it was set. This is the only part of the dress that wasn't absolutely perfect. Even the bride wanted to know where I got it!

I might have been able to to get away with an 8 but my body is a weird kind of hour glass shape; I'm always sizing up to make sure my bosom and my hips are comfy . The straps do get a little annoying because you have to make sure they're secured on you or you can go from classy to exposed in 2.5 . Though, that didn't take away from my experience AT ALL.

I'm a little thicker at the bottom so I was nervous that it would fit but once It was on it looked great. It has no stretch, but I think that helps the dress have a really nice shape to it. I was nervous about the front being too low but I felt very comfortable that it wasn't too much cleavage. I was even able to wear a regular flesh toned bra underneath so that was a plus. Had to hike it up a little to dance the way I wanted to lol","October 7, 2019","Wedding"

The dress is form fitting, fit true to size, and didn't require a bra for me. It was definitely snug around the thigh area, but I wore it all night without a problem! I couldn't see this in the RTR photos, but the a small strip of the waist area of this dress is mesh. This was fine for me and really wasn't obvious at all, but something to keep in mind for modesty. I would recommend sizing up for this one, since it is quite form fitting.","September 18, 2019","True to Size"

I loved the fun ruffles at the hem and the embroidery detail is beautiful. It's the perfect spring/summer wedding guest dress.

The material is really nice and fits beautifully, I got lots on compliments on the dress. It is very uncomfortable to sit, so be mindful of that.

Wearing a size up allowed a better fit for my hips/legs and was comfortable to move and dance in. I received so many compliments and I regretted having to send it back! This was my first Rent The Runway experience and look forward to renting this and other items in the future.","August 19, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VNE7","RTR Customer","It was a formal charity gala with a garden theme.","I wore this to a formal charity gala and it was absolutely beautiful. The embroidery is gorgeous and I got so many compliments. The fit is lovely and the ruffles at the bottom add a lot of interest to the silhouette. I am 5'6"" and 130 lbs with an hourglass shape and chose to order the 2 and 4. Both fit, but the 2 was definitely tight in the legs. It was possible to walk but not very comfortable so I ended up wearing the 4 and felt great and comfortable all night. If you're someone with really athletic legs/thighs, I'd consider sizing up. Also, undergarments are a little tough with this dress because of the transparency. It's best to wear it without a bra and for that reason, sticking true to size would probably be smart.","August 15, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VNE7","Kristina","The most stunning floral dress!","This dress was PERFECT for a summer wedding at a farm. So so flattering. The quality was exceptional and the fit was great. Overall true to size, but I usually teeter between a 0 and a 2, choosing the 2 because the dress is a bit tight around the hips (and I needed room for eating and dancing!) The compliments did not stop the entire night and I felt very confident in this dress. Although the material appears heavy in pictures, I actually never felt too hot and the mesh panel in the middle helped make the dress unique and breathable. I 10/10 recommend this dress for any semi-formal spring or summer wedding!","August 13, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VNE7","RTR Customer","Fabulous dress with feminine details","I loved the unique features of the dress - the sheer flouncy ruffles at the bottom and sheer mid section (it's hard to tell from the photos but it is sheer in the front middle). The length was just past my knees which was perfect for me. It's almost a dress that requires custom fitting though, as the mid section seems to require a certain length torso - I am 5'4"" and have a long torso and short legs, so the part where they assume your hips will be kind of made a poof at the belly, but the floral pattern made it easy to hide. I typically wear size 2 but the bottom of the dress was so tight on my thighs I could barely pull it on (think tight miniskirt under the ruffles) so I wore the 4 in order to be able to walk and sit! In my photo I wore a nude cami underneath because it was a bit low cut for the event I was attending, but it looked just fine, and was great without it as well (except bottom of bra can somewhat be seen in the sheer midriff section where there is no embroidery). Overall it was a lovely dress and I would rent it again!","July 3, 2019","Wedding"

For sizing help, I felt the dress ran true to size, however the bust area did seem to run large. I actually liked this because I have broader shoulders. I went with a size up from my usual size 8 because I wanted a little more room in the hips because it's very fitted in the lower part of the dress.","June 19, 2019","Wedding"

My dresses actually arrived almost a week early which I found odd, but cool. The original size of 12 fit me perfectly and I typically wear a 12 in dresses. The 10 also fit pretty well but just a bit tighter overall and the trim line just above the ruffles was too tight on the 10. That would be my only con to the dress- the trim line above the ruffle section is tight with no give. It worked for me though and I have pretty muscular thighs.

The first try on the zipper was a little tough to close because of the fabric and like others said, it is definitely tight especially around the rib cage. By the next time I tried it on, the zipper went up easily. For anyone ordering this dress, definitely get a size up just in case. The way the fabric sits, it really hugs your curves and smooths out your stomach and butt!","January 19, 2020","Formal Affair"

It felt way too big in the top and looked almost frumpy, but I think if I had rented the size 14 (US size 10) then it would've been too snug on my tummy/hip area; however, I think the 14 (US 10) would've been perfect up top! The fabric was beautiful and felt expensive. If you don't have a large bottom half then I would suggest ordering the smaller size if you're in between sizes. I think it is definitely made large on top since the US 12 was big on my 36DD size. I may rent again, but will try it in the US 10 if I do. Oh, and it has pockets!","September 4, 2019","Other"

The fabric is heavy enough that you don't have to worry about a breeze blowing up the skirt, but not so heavy that it hangs without any movement. It's an outfit all its own, and I just wore it with white keds.

As stated - the slit can be a little high, so I wore it with tights since my legs aren't my favorite feature. You will also need to wear a strapless bra, and will need to do something with the neck piece since it is a little stretched out (it has to go over your head).

I decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did. This dress in size XS fit me like a glove. My measurements are 32C bust, 24 waist, and 34 hips. If you're tiny or a petite 00 or 0 this dress will fit you in the size XS. The dress is well made and the lace is gorgeous. It elongates your body and makes you appear taller than you are if you're on the short side. The dress came to just above my ankles in the back which was the perfect elegant length.

Per size rec, I got XSR & def could get away with wearing it, but the slit also goes very high up near the lady bits (use tape for security).

It was very flattering and I got a lot of compliments. The pattern was unique and the bell sleeves were not TOO big as bell sleeves can sometimes be. I have a smaller chest so I did not have to wear a bra with this since the elastic was pretty supportive. The only negatives were that the elastics on the sleeves went down past the elbows, meaning it made it more I comfortable than it needed to be in my opinion. Also, since it had sort of a babydoll design it could at times make you look a little larger in the stomach than you really are but because of the flattering top portion it didn't really bother me.","April 3, 2019","Other"

It was short - had to wear a tank top underneath to add some length, but that was okay because it allowed me to wear a regular bra. It stayed off the shoulder fine, but the smocking kept creeping up so I'd have to pull it back down - probably wouldn't be an issue with a smaller chest.

I wore my usual size, Large (I usually am between a 10-12 in normal dresses) Could be worn by anyone looking for a maxi-style. The material and fit is very flattering, the print is extremely fun and can be really dressed up or down depending on your venue/time of day. It could've been worn with flats, I wore 2.5 inch heels (I am 5'10"") and it fell a little on the short side, but a detail probably only noticed by me. A strapless bra was needed for me, but I could see others not pregnant going without one given the nice stretchy material in the bust region.

Things to note- this dress is made of a structured fabric so it is not very forgiving, especially through the midsection and hips. The fabric does stretch a little, but not much. The bodice is also very structured with boning and runs a little on the large side. I had to use moderate bra cups to fill the bodice out, but it actually added a buffer for the boning and made the dress more comfortable. This dress is great if your going to be up and moving most of the event- I would not recommend this if you plan to be sitting a lot.","April 3, 2019","True to Size"

Also, I'm an a-cup and there was a lot of extra room in the top - it wasn't a problem though. Lastly, the straps kept losening throughout the evening so I had my husband continuously tighten them.

This style is a big on me because I am wearing a size 2, However, my true size is a 0. This style should have a fitted look throughout the bust and loose at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra or no bra since there is an open back. At 5‚Äô3‚Äù, the length hit floor length on me. The dress is amazing in person.

It was actually a dress I chose at the last minute when my original dress didn't fit right. They overnighted it to me so that I would have it in time for my event. This dress is beautiful, a thick material that was perfect for a winter formal event, but was definitely too big up top. I just pinned the straps (in the front to bring it up) and the hanger straps right into the dress liner to avoid them popping out all night and it worked great. The material is gorgeous and the fit was very comfortable. I'm 5'8"" 157 lbs and the 8R fit pretty good in the waist, but the top was too big. I could have probably fit a 6R in that dress and it would have been perfect. The back is as gorgeous as everyone else says and was my favorite feature of the dress. And who doesn't love deep pockets? Overall, I'm happy with my rental.","December 11, 2018","Formal Affair"

I would say the size runs big. I am normally a size 10 but was able to fit the 8R around the rib cage.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR90","Marisa","Simple, elegant, and comfortable.","I wore this to a black tie optional company holiday party. I got so many compliments on this dress from the moment I put it on, to the comments on my facebook days later. I didn't want to take it off, and I certainly didn't want to return it. Be warned though, the length is longer than the photo on the model suggests. I'm about 6 ft tall or so in my photo with those heels on, and you can see the back touches the floor, and the front is a bit longer than the knees. The back length didn't bother me (except trying to keep it off of the dirty NYC sidewalks). The only other issue I had was that the chest was a little big on me. It was almost undetectable unless you were looking closely, but I am very small of top so I imagine this won't be an issue for most. I'm a 34A and typically a size 8 in pants. I ordered the 6R and was pleased with the fit. I knew it would be a bit big on top, but was happy with the rest. I'm glad I didn't get an 8 even though that's my typical size. I recommend taking that into consideration if your hips are quite larger than your waist and bust as mine are. This was my back up dress so I didn't get it in another size, but I would recommend a 6R and a 4R as back up if your body is similar to mine.","January 9, 2018","True to Size"

As others stated, the dress does run big so I ordered a 6R but wear an 8 in most cases. The straps unfortunately are big, which I had to doctor up a bit to keep from falling, and being that I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, even in heels the back was too low and easy for people to step on. The look was perfect, the functionality, not so much, but I actually would consider ordering again.","January 2, 2018","Large"

I am 5'2"", 122 pounds, with a size 34A chest. I typically wear a size 4, but wore a size 2 in this dress. The straps were long, and the dress was VERY large in the chest area. I ended up using several pins to shorten the straps and tuck in the sides to make it fit my bust. It took me an hour, but when I was done the dress fit perfectly. The high / low hem worked well for my petite height. The front of the dress hit just above my ankles, and even with my 4 inch heels I had a small train in the back. I am a sucker for pockets, so obvi they were my favorite feature. I felt great, and received compliments ALL NIGHT LONG.

I have a petite frame and normally wear a size 4 but the 4R was too big (straps too long; bodice not snug enough to cover chest) and the 2R was quite snug (had adjust the sides of the bodice to ensure coverage; waist was tight). So this dress runs large and/or small depending on your body type. It was evident that the dress had been worn before given the slight fraying on the skirt and missing hook at the top of the zipper. However, the pattern and texture were gorgeous and the back is dramatic and ladylike. Because of my height, the dress had a substantial train when I wore it. All in all, the style was classic with a little edge and it was so much fun to wear!","June 13, 2017","Large"

When I read reviews, after I got the email about getting my back-up instead, I messaged with the RTR staff and they were able to change my order from a 4/6 to a 2/4, which was greatly appreciated. The clasp on the top of the zipper in the back, was missing the ""eye"" part of the hook and eye closure, so beware, you may need help zipping it up.

I wore a 3in. heel with the dress so it did not feel like it was dragging on the ground. I did not wear a bra with this as the top fit snug enough against my body to feel comfortable going without an adhesive bra.

The 4R couldn't be shipped to me due to it was either returned late and/or damaged. Luckily enough I could squeeze into the 2R, but not comfortably. Was tight around the neck and chest/waist area where the band comes across. I made the best out of the situation was in, but I have a feeling the 4R would've fit a lot more comfortably and not look tight on the top half of my body.

The bust area is wide open in the front, so I couldn't wear a bra (hated it!). I had to wear boob tape, which was horrible, on top of it all the top was big! So I felt quite uncomfortable the whole time. It looked great, and I got tons of compliments, but I felt uncomfortable. Also, probably could have gotten the 20R, since it was SO SO long that I tripped if I didn't pick it up in the front","February 6, 2020","True to Size"

I'm 5'8 and wore a 2in heel and had to be careful not to step on the dress so I could have worn a higher heel.

I am 5'5"" and got the petite version since it was the only one in my size available and it was still pretty long (even with a 3"" heel). I have to admit I almost tripped on it a couple of times going up stairs. I loved that it has a built-in bra (very slightly padded) so you may not needed to wear your own (I still wore pasties because I didn't want to accidentally risk getting exposed if I bent over). I think if you have a medium or smaller bust, this will look classy and conservative. For larger, it may expose lots of cleavage so keep that in mind based on your event!

Not a deal-breaker though. I think this dress runs a little big. Or maybe it's that I'm between sizes & got the larger of the two.

I am typically either a 10 or 12 in dresses, with a 34D bust, but the 10R fit me perfectly! The only downer to this dress is that because I have a shorter torso, the straps were a little loose so I was showing a bit more cleavage than I typically would like to. I fixed the issue by using an adhesive bra, but still felt a little more exposed than usual. Absolutely love the fact that this dress has pockets, and it's the perfect fabric for a beach wedding or a summer event. An absolute breeze to dance in as well!","June 28, 2019","True to Size"

Adjustable straps would have helped to make the bust fit a little better, but the size 6 was perfect for my small waist/large hips. Super forgiving in the hips, size to your waist/bust. The material is like an elevated printed linen. I was comfortable in very hot weather in this dress. Love the bright coral accent along the blue stripes and the Chevron pattern is very flattering. Worked with a normal strapless bra or without a bra if you're a little bustier than a 34B.","June 5, 2019","True to Size"

It was a classy black dress with some fun details-- the print is great, the sheer sleeves are a nice touch, and the length is a fun balance! I thought it was super flattering. The only (minor) complaint was that the zipper was a little hard to get over the waistband when trying to put it on myself and I needed help, but that's really the only issue I had.","February 2, 2020","Wedding"

The sleeves were sheer, so it didn't help that the entire wedding was outside, but the look was perfect for the wedding. I never wear animal print, but the velvet leopard print was subtle enough that I loved it. The waist hit at the perfect spot. The length was a little longer for me than what is showed on the model, since I'm 5'4"", but it didn't make a huge difference. The 10R had a little bit of tearing at the seam on the right sleeve, but that was the only problem with the dress.

Anyway - I'm not a ""flowery"" type however this theme was Spring and this romper was a huge hit! With it being an LGBT event I got away with the shortness (cause they're so fun) but for a corporate or more conservative event wouldn't recommend it.

It was comfy & LOVED that I could wear a regular bra! Good length too- I wore 3.5"" block heels, but took them off during the reception & was able to dance the night away with no problem because of the long slit. Only minor issue was the long slit does go up pretty high when you sit or really get into the dancing, but nothing major. Would rent it again for sure! :)","October 16, 2019","Wedding"

The dress was flattering, and hugged in all the right places. The slit and the subtle waist cutout were just enough to be sexy, but still classy.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL253","Malikah","Comfortable and stylish","You can't go wrong with a black dress, and this one is a classic. It fit well enough, but there was a little bit of bulging in lower back area. I had to keep pulling the dress down and adjusting the top front, as my bra kept showing. This dress is sexy enough without showing a ton of skin. I wore a black bra, so when the top front of the dress slipped down, it wouldn't be terribly noticeable. Also awesome was the fact that I wore my Spanx under this dress quite comfortably. Even though the midsection has a lace-like design that's intended to show skin, my Spanx came up to just under my bra. No one noticed that it was my Spanx showing through, and not my skin! I recommend this dress for any formal occasion. I'm a 38D, and size 14 in regular clothes.","May 8, 2019","Wedding"

It was my back up dress and a solid choice that I ended up wearing. It is form fitting and has zero stretch. It was a little small on me. However, I think one size up would probably have been too big. Because it was a little tight on me with no stretch I did not have full range of motion in my arms for dancing. Also the fabric is a heavy polyester so it was very warm and did not breathe. The front slit is pretty high if you are going to be moving around a lot. I was glad to have biker short style spanx in black underneath. In summary, a solid dress that will flatter your curves. Nothing to write home about but I felt pretty and look good in the pictures.","May 6, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLN21","Elle","A Stunner!","I wore this dress 4 times at both casual and formal events. The fabric where you tie the front is long enough such that you can wrap it to cover the cut out, giving it a more classy and formal look if you'd like. I'm 5'9 and the dress was a great maxi for my height, though it may be a bit long if you're shorter. I'm in between 10-12 (more 10) and XL was the size recommended for me. If I had gone with a L, it would have been too small. I wore this twice with a bra: once with it more conservative and once the way it's shown and I liked the way it looked. I had a lace bra that matched my makeup to tie it together, so don't feel like you have to go braless. If you're bustier, I think braless will be a hit or miss. Fabric is on the thinner side so you may not be happy with the support with the fabric alone. Side note: on a windy day you may need to hold the dress so it doesn't open up. Not too big of an issue. Overall amazing dress!!","May 26, 2019","Other"

The cut-out can be tied in either the back or front, depending on how much skin you're willing to show. This dress is on the longer side, so you might need to wear heels depending on how tall you are. The tie-front is a real, functioning tie-front, so if you're worried about the knot coming undone, wear a bra underneath.

Definitely recommend if you're comfortable showing off your midriff. I'm not sure how the underwear should be applied with this dress--I think pasties would show through so a strapless bra might be needed if you don't want to show nip. Seamless panties still seemed to show as well. I think the drama of the dress would distract people from looking at your lines tho.","December 29, 2019","Party"

The back strap keeps things in place and the cut is very flattering -- flowy and fitted at the same time! The pic doesn't really do it justice, but my robe is the most open in this pic. The blue is darker than I expected which gave it a more preppy vibe (which I was ambivalent about), but if you're not into that look than this is not the dress for you (the back strap, which my robe covered, adds to this effect even more).

It flowed well, was the right amount of cute and casual for a outdoor concert. My only complaint was it really cannot be worn with a bra, which just made me self conscious. I am not chesty and can't imagine anyone with anything bigger than a c cup not spilling out of it. I ended up doing inserts, but felt like I was messing with them most of the evening.

The tiers were fun and ruffly, the skirt was well-made, and the colors were sober but still unique. I loved it. Because there's some elastic in the waist, this runs a little on the larger side - especially if you have a small waist, you might want to consider sizing down. I'm slimmer in the hip than the waist, and the 8 was still a VERY comfortable fit for me. I'd definitely rent again.

The waist cinches you in well enough that it counteracts the volume in the layers and the link is just right and appropriate for any occasion including work if you work in a fashion forward environment.

It's a way to spice up a regular black skirt. It does have some volume, but I don't think it makes you look wider.

So I would say that it was classy with just the right amount of sexiness. It didn't get 5 stars from me because I felt that the straps were super thin (worrisome), there was a snap enclosure at the chest that was working overtime to not come apart, and the seams down the middle of the chest panels gave my (natural and bra-less) chest a bit of a creased shape. From far away in photos, none of those concerns are visible, though.

I liked the button detail in the front to help keep cleavage from falling out. It is long and I read that in other reviews, if I had worn this I would have had to pin the bottom up several inches all the way around even with heels. So not an ideal length for shorter people. Beautiful pattern and the fabric was comfortable. I would rent this again post pregnancy.

I have a large bust and the material kept slipping down and showing a bit of my black strapless bra. I had to adjust the back straps on the tightest setting since the front was so draped. Since the arm straps were so tight, that meant I couldn't get out of it to go to the bathroom without help! So basically I just wore this for a few hours each time.

The bust was way too large and the cowl neck was just too deep of a cut if that makes sense. I do not recommend this for any body types.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AX103","Lisa e","Nice summer skirt","This skirt is great, although it‚Äôs very long (both in the skirt and in the waist) so I‚Äôd recommend it for people who are tall. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and it was to my lower mid-calf. I would also say the way the sizes are listed is a little misleading - they say the size S a 2, but it fit like a Small that more like a 4 and I would definitely have been better off with the XS/0. The waist was fairly large on me, but the belt can be tied tighter to make it fit more like a paper-bag style skirt. I should note, however, that it‚Äôs a bit annoying that there is a belt but no belt loops ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt tie the belt tight and fairly low on the skirt and around your natural waist, the skirt will slip out of the belt. All that said, it‚Äôs a very pretty summer skirt, with pockets. Also, even though it's thin-ish smooth cotton it is not really that prone to wrinkling - I was caught in a downpour in it and it was totally soaked, but after the rain stopped and the skirt dried, it looked crisp and immaculate again, and I wore it again without any steaming or ironing.","August 27, 2018","Large"

It's a beautiful, stiffer fabric but still cool, and the tie around the waist helps pull it together and feel comfortable even with buttons (which don't gape bc the skirt is pretty perfectly flared, even for my wider hips). It IS a long skirt even on me (5'9"") and I feel like it has worked best with heels/platforms so may be too long for some shorter ladies.

After reading all of the reviews, I was so excited for this dress to arrive.... But when I first laid eyes on it, I thought it was super matronly... Then I put it on and felt super matronly. Long story short, this dress requires some styling- don't think you can try it on without accessories, hair/makeup, and be wowed. With that being said, I paired the dress with a thin camel colored belt & matching camel colored wedges... Threw in a little jewelry & natural bronzey summer makeup & felt like a million bucks. The color is stunning, and all but glows when the sun hits it. The floral applique is GORGEOUS & really makes the dress. Very flowy when you walk, and is sure to be a head turner... Just be sure to accessorize! Note: fits true to size. Very roomy dress, but the waist has zero stretch, so be sure to rent your true size to fit your rib cage.","June 14, 2019","Everyday"

This style is fitted through the midsection. It works best for A-C cup sizes since it's fitted at bust. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this top so you should wear a strapless bra since it has a sweetheart neckline. The white floral print is bold in person, but it can work as a daytime and going out top. Pair with black flats and a denim jacket to complete your outfit!","March 5, 2019","Small"

Also, the bust was tight and I couldn't wear a bra. I wore a size 12 and I have a 36c bust. The top has enough structure that you can go without a bra; it holds you in.

It also is *really* long! I'm 5'7"" and normally never have issues with RTR length, but I absolutely had to wear wedges with this or the skirt would trail on the ground (which is just not an option for gross city streets).

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/STS89","RTR Customer","I LOVED this dress!!","I've never worn red before, but I will more often! I received tons of compliments on this show stopper. I'm 5'9"", 145 lbs and decided to go to go with my back up size which was the L. The M fit, but I was more comfortable with the extra room the larger size gave me. Since it's a wrap dress, the two sides came together better.","November 25, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Kian","You'll get compliments all night with this feminine, flirty fit.","The modern cuts and angles of this dress help it avoid the ""tablecloth"" look most lace dresses give. The back slid a lot (see photos), but if you have dress tape (mine wore off with sweat), you should be good. For those who are slim/curvy, this dress is perfect.","March 5, 2020","True to Size"

The only thing I'd note is the tie in the back of the dress is a bit loose since it's a large but outside of that, great fit","February 17, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Carson","I've never felt more beautiful in a dress.","Cuts very close to the side of my bust, but still covered it even through dancing all night. It's short, very short and I have hips and a butt but it was all still covered because the lace stays ridged. The lace is tight- it takes time to pull the sleeves on and in place. I would recommend to anyone to go a size up.","February 5, 2020","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Kristen","So flattering, tons of compliments!","Loved this dress, and got so many compliments! There was some side boob that I had to adjust for with dress tape, but wasn't a big deal after that. Would recommend!","January 9, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Kristi","Too revealing for a winter day but hot, hot, hot!","This dress is stunning but a little young (I'm 33). I paired it with leggings and a lace tank top because it was so cold out. Also it's very short if you have a booty. This dress would be perfect on Venice Beach and worn by a tan 20-something.","November 24, 2019","Date"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Brooke","LOVE THIS DRESS!!!!","The XS fit perfectly! The dress wasn't too long or too short so I definitely recommend it to anyone who is short. The only issue I faced, was that since the dress is open back it doesn't really secure the chest. All I had to do was use a little fashion tape on the sides to make sure I wasn't showing too much side boob. Other than that, it fit everywhere else.","October 29, 2019","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Emma","Perfect for a special night","I have been eyeing this dress for a while and so glad I rented it. Definitely short and revealing- lots of side boob for me! But I loved the look. The back is so sexy and the fabric feels super luxe. The dress was a bit smushed and crumpled when it arrived but the wrinkles came right out. If you have bigger boobs go up a size for sure!","October 22, 2019","Other"

Wish I would have gotten a medium instead of a small , was pretty short had to pull my dress down a few times .Ran a little small but made it work . I looovee this dress .","September 23, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Joy","Sexy yet sophisticated","Perfect fit, super comfortable. Hem was short without feeling like I had to pull it down at all while walking around. I love the balance of exposed sides/back and a short form fitting style with long sleeves to keep it classy. Even if you have a bust (I'm 34C) the cut out covered up without having under or side boob exposure. I'd rent this one again! Big fan of For Love & Lemons I own a few of their dresses and knew this would not disappoint!","September 23, 2019","Date"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Tria","Very cute and flattering but smaller on top.","The dress got a lot of compliments and looked good for the most part. The top was a little right and the snaps kept us napping through the night.","September 1, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","RTR Customer","Must Rent This Again!","I LOVED this dress! It was surprisingly comfortable, and I got tons of compliments. The belt was a little loose since it wasn't adjustable, and the back was slightly longer than the front. I find that I vary in size in FL&L, but my normal size small fit perfectly. I am dying to rent this again for another event.","August 29, 2019","True to Size"

The only thing is that the sides run up the chest. If I put my arms up, I may have had a nip slip... it's best worn where this is relatively acceptable.","August 26, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Xiaoshan","Love the dress.","I wanted a white dress for a summer party, embracing my bride-to-be phase. The XS was slightly tight on the arms and just too short on me. But S fit me really well, even after pizza and tacos! My suggestion is to get a larger size if you want to eat :P I got so many compliments at the party.","August 20, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Masha","More excited about the dress than the party!","I've been dreaming about wearing this dress since I first saw it on RTR. It's slightly elastic and fits the body perfectly so it was super comfortable to eat, drink and dance in. Gorgeous finishes and pristine condition just made me feel like a goddess for the day!","August 14, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Alison","Sexy! Perfect for my Bachelorette!","This dress was awesome. When I rented it it was definitely a little out of my comfort zone with the open back and cutouts but I got so many compliments and felt amazing in it! The only thing is if you raised your arms you could show a little side boob. Overall really fun dress, perfect for my bachelorette party!","August 13, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Sarah elizabeth","HollyShorts Film Festival","I wore this For Love & Lemons dress to HollyShorts Film Festival, where I had a film screening. It was a beautiful, summery dress that filled the niche of being dressy without being overdressed for the occasion. Photographed well, especially over-the-shoulder to show the open back design. Only downside was that the cotton lace seemed to have held a lot of odor from previous RTR wear. #renttherunway #festival #filmfestival #redcarpet","August 10, 2019","Party"

Like how often do you have an opportunity to wear a white, short, backless dress? So many compliment and made me feel so confident. Pro Tip: For all my tall ladies out there- this dress is short on us. I could have fit in a S but just make sure the booty didn't pop out I opted for the M.","August 7, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Christy","Wore this to my bridal shower surrounded by my friends","The dress itself is stunning. I was a little worried when I first tried it on if my boobs were going to fall out the sides since I wore a medium and am a 34C but they were comfortable and I never once worried about them when I got to the party. The dress did not feel too short when I wore heels and I'm 5'6 and 145, I never tugged on it during the entire event.","August 7, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL7","Kiersten","White Party Perfection","So so so many people have asked me where I got this dress. It was a hit! Super comfortable to wear, my only ""con"" was that it was a little short for my 5'10 frame and that the ""belt"" around the waist was a little loose on me and fell out of place if I wasn't standing a certain way. (This was easily resolved with fashion tape.) I loved it and would recommend! Just be cautious of sizing. The small was far too tiny on me. There was a pretty big difference between the S and the M.","July 17, 2019","Party"

Wore the S. The strap around my ribs was too lose and as you can see it fell a bit but wasn't an issue. I'm muscular so the S accommodated my arms better and was incredibly comfortable. I would have been pulling as the XS all night. In the pic I'm ~116 lbs.","June 26, 2019","True to Size"

The strap that goes around the middle of your back was a little loose and kept falling down, but it just looked like part of the bottom of the dress so it didn't bother me too much. I was a little nervous about the bust area as I am breastfeeding, but everything stayed put where it was supposed to!","June 2, 2019","Date"
