"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","Nina b.","Classy & edgy for a black tie dinner","I wore this dress to a ""black tie preferred"" (whatever that means) event. I was hesitant to wear black because I usually opt for flashier ensembles, but I didn't know anyone there, so I played it safe...but not too safe! This dress has a little something extra with the asymmetrical hem and cut out in the back (which I think is a koi fish?). I tried on my usual size 8, but, like other reviewers have mentioned, the 6 fit better, thanks to the free hip measurement. Where previous reviewers led me astray, though, was in the undergarment department: I definitely needed a bra for this look. The fabric is thick and certainly not see-through, but there just wasn't enough boob squishage to make me feel comfortable going without one. I ended up wearing one of those stick-on bras with the clear sides and it worked perfectly. And speaking of undergarments, I was worried that the top of my high-waisted chonies would peek out the bottom of the back cutout, but they were fine. I felt comfortable and fabulous all night!","February 15, 2020","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","Medalit","The dress was an absolute dream. Comfortable fit. True to size.","The dress flows and makes you feel like you floating. The material is a little heavier than I expected, but I liked it because it kept the integrity and shape of the dress. I wore it to a wedding and it made dancing so much more fun. The back of the dress is the beautiful detail. I have to take a picture of it. It's very comfortable to wear. I would definitely wear this again.","June 11, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","Kayla","Such a great dress!","This was actually my back-up dress. I ended up wearing because my original choice was too long, but this one ended up being perfect! I wore to a school fundraiser, so I needed something more on the conservative side. The asymmetric hemline and the back kept it fun though. The fabric was heavier than I was expecting, which was a plus. I wore pasties underneath, but it was thick enough you could probably get away with nothing if you wanted. The design on the back is also intricate enough to hide a black bra if you want the extra support. So sad to send it back!","April 19, 2019","True to Size"

It hugged in all the right places without being tight or restricting. I want to own this thing, that’s how beautiful it is. Got to a of compliments. Be careful if you are someone who ends up taking off your heels, the length is easy to get tripped up on once those come off.","January 27, 2019","True to Size"

It was comfortable and not too tight. The dress material is nice and not too thin, so I was able to get away with wearing pasties and no bra (score!). I got tons of compliments on this dress!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","RTR Customer","Elegant, flattering and fun","I felt lovely in this dress, to the point I was sad to send it back. It was great to dance in it. The dress runs large. Typically, I run between a 4 and a 6, but as they were out of the 6, I ordered the 4 and 2P. Surprisingly, the 2 fit best without shapewear (I can't breathe in those things so don't tend to wear them). The petite length was better with my height. The dress seemed to have a bit of wear but not enough to prevent me from wearing it.","July 15, 2018","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","Tara","black tie wedding perfection!","I'm 5 months postpartum and needed something classy for a black tie wedding since most of my formal dresses don't fit at the moment. This dress was perfect!! The cut and material was very flattering. The high low skirt added just the right amount of drama. The back was fun and I was still able to wear a regular bra. The 4 was a tiny bit tight under the arms but I made it work. The 6 would've been more comfortable but wasn't available since I ordered so last minute.","July 2, 2018","True to Size"

I loved the look and style of the dress but I didn't wear it because I thought the torso didn't fit right. It pooched out a little just below my waist and made me look slightly pregnant. Either that or it was not quite the right length in the torso--but I'm not sure if it was too long or too short! My husband preferred this dress on me but I just thought it was too big--and this was a 0P! Could have used a 00.","June 28, 2018","Large"

I love how it's different lengths and how the fabric cascades down- has a dramatic romantic feel to it. The back was also really cool. It is flattering also. But because I am on the shorter side, the fabric on the long side was very long and I had to hold it a lot, especially on the dance floor. Overall I was happy and it was beautiful and unique!","May 20, 2018","Wedding"

I had to find something formal enough for the event and unencumberome enough to work.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","Emily","A knockout!","I wore this dress to officiate my brother's wedding. I was looking for something formal but not flashy, simple but not drab - and this dress fit the bill perfectly. It's a bit tight up top and has a defined waist, but drapes beautifully at the hips - great for ladies with more of an hourglass/pear-shaped figure. What really sets this dress apart are the little details that make it fun: the asymmetrical hem and the lace on the back. The fabric is thick and stretchy so it hangs well and really does hide imperfections (I was three months postpartum and felt super comfortable in it.) I was a bit worried about the length since I'm on the shorter side (5' 4""), but with 3 inch heels the hem just barely grazed the floor. Honestly for the price of the rental I think this dress is a bargain. I wouldn't hesitate to rent it again!","November 8, 2017","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","Jena","Great material and length.","I ordered a 0R and 0P but both dresses shipped were 0R, so I'm glad the length worked! I'm 5'4"" and wore 4"" block heels. In pics, it appeared to be a plain black dress but was much better in person and with good lighting to show back detail and asymmetrical hem length. Great dress for dancing and twirling!","October 11, 2017","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","RTR Customer","Loved the dress! Simple in the front and intricate in the back.","I am really short (5 feet), so the longest part of the dress did touch the floor which stressed me out. I wore 2.5 in heels. Although the dress was long, I was never stepping on it and I barely even realized when I wasn't looking in a mirror. The rest of the dress fit perfectly and I loved it. I got so many compliments and it was very fun to dance it. Loved the black because I got to pair it with a fun, floral shoe. Definitely would recommend and have recommended to so many people already!","September 26, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","Valeria","This dress was so fun to dance in!","Boyfriend and I did a fun dinner date and went to a restaurant with a live jazz band. This dress was so much fun to dance in! It is so comfortable, the material isn't heavy, and whenever he turned me, the skirt would flare around. I am usually a size 2, but I am pretty short (5ft) so I ordered a 2 petite and for back up I got a size 0 regular. The 2 was a little too big for me on the chest and stomach area (bra size 34A) but the length was just right. I went with the 0R because it hugged on top perfectly and I was going to be wearing heels so the height was not too much of a problem. I got so many compliments! From the hostess to the ladies I bumped into in the restroom. To be honest I was a *little* overdressed for my occasion. I was at a restaurant where a lot of people were in jeans and a nice shirt, but even knowing that now, i still would've chosen the same dress. It's an elegant dress but the flirty cut on the bottom makes it perfect for a lot of occasions!","August 6, 2017","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","Kirstin","Comfortable AND stunning!","This would not have been my first choice, but I decided too late to rent for this ""black tie optional"" wedding, and I kept coming back to this one because of the little details that made it different from your normal LBD - the asymmetrical hem, and, OMG, the back! It is true that it makes it difficult to wear a bra (I wore a Brazee that I got from RTR a while ago), because not only is the black sheer, but it really does start toward the side. I normally wear more form fitting dresses (sheaths), so to have such a flowy dress was different for me, and I liked it. I felt completely comfortable all night long. The dress is LONG, though. At 5'7 in 3.5-inch heels, the 4R was manageable. When I switched to my flats for walking back to the car at the end of the night, the dress would have dragged had I not carried it like a train. The 4R was the only size available, but I think I could have easily fit into a 2, and the tightness in the chest might have made me able to go bra-free.","July 30, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA143","Brooke","Perfect Black Dress","My sister had her bridesmaids wear any black dress for her wedding. I saw this dress and thought it was perfect for her winter themed wedding. I loved the side high-low to show off my snow boots and I loved the lacy back for the elegant details. The cut is perfect to feel comfortable and you don't have that ""I need to suck it in"" feeling. Length is perfect even with flat shoes. Definitely an edgy dress but still elegant.","July 6, 2017","Wedding"

It was extremely comfortable and with 4in heels the train in the back was the perfect length. You can see a bra through the back, but personally I wore a regular black bra and I felt it didn't diminish the beauty of the dress. There is no built-in support so if you're larger in the chest area, you'll need something! I will be looking out for this dress in the final sale section ;)","June 17, 2017","Formal Affair"

I typically wear a 6/8, and this is probably pretty true to size. It was slightly bigger than I would have liked, and the ruching bunched up a little because of that (which made me feel lumpy at times). However, we had dinner in Hell's Kitchen, walked to the theatre for a show, and then walked around for dessert and Christmas light viewing, and it was remarkably comfortable.

I had so many compliments and people asking where it was from. The arms are a little snug, but I think maybe some people are wearing it too far down on their shoulders and that's what it making it so uncomfortable...its supposed to sit right at the top of your shoulders. It was long enough for me, and the liner was comfortable. I ordered up a size and got the 12 with 14 as a backup. I am 5""11, 170lbs, 36D, hourglass shape.","November 11, 2017","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CN19","Anna","Fabulous hostess dress","Got so many compliments; it was the ideal cut, style, color, shape for hosting a cocktail Christmas party. There's not a lot of stretch, so def glad I ordered a larger back up size. The only drawback were the weird hanger loops that due to their placement and the unusual neckline, really liked to poke out, so I spent a lot of time fussing with them. But it's such a gorgeous dress; fits like a glove, but still flattering. Great for a winter party. Bottom of the dress is fairly tight, so don't do too much dancing. Ideal for floating around a party though.","January 1, 2017","Party"

Absolutely GORGEOUS on. I wore it to a NYE event and I got compliments all night. I'm usually a 2, but ordered the 4 because the 2 wasn't available. The 4 was perfect.

The ceremony was outside on a mountain in PA in the early evening. Found a great dress on here and ordered my true size (6) and the next size up after reading the comments. Luckily I did, because I ended up wearing the 8. It definitely runs small. It arrived as stated in 2 days, in a beautiful garment bag. The dress's lining was silky smooth and very comfortable. As written in other comments the back zipper was VERY hard to zip! ? It was longer than I like, but did get lots of compliments on it! Again it was very comfortable to wear all evening. I will definitely use RTR again!","October 16, 2016","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CN19","Megan","Sexy","The fit is tight but you wouldn't want it any bigger otherwise you'd look like a golden bag. I have bigger arms so it was a super tight fit in the arm shoulder are and the dress cut into me there. Problem solved with a black pashmina. Also the lining in the front does hang down noticeably. And there were several quarter sized holes in lace. No one noticed. I would definitely rent again & will recommend in the future.","October 9, 2016","Wedding"

But I ended up wearing it anyway and it photographed very well at our annual holiday party. A note for my fellow short ladies, this will hit you below the knees, so it looks best with heels. The other reviews are 100% accurate, the sleeves are EXTREMELY tight, so you should definitely size up just for the arms alone.","September 5, 2016","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CN19","Lisa","Eye catching and flattering dress - perfect for a fancy night out!","Overall, this was a great rental. I received many compliments on the fit, style and sparkle of this dress. As other reviewers have reported, the color has quite a greenish/brown/black undertone, and there is a distinct floral pattern to the gold overlay. Cut is very flattering, but there is little stretch to this dress and it has very slim arms...although there are zippers along the forearms, it doesn't give much wiggle room. Slim cut skirt as well, with little stride room when walking/upstairs. There are four (!) attachment pieces of ribbon to assist in hanging the dress, which were very short, poorly placed and consistently popped out throughout the course of the night...really a shame for an otherwise flawless dress. I generally run between sizes but read reviews carefully and went with a 6. Glad I did. Don't have large arms but they never would have fit in a 4. Great sparkle and wears easily. I paired with gold and brown jewelry, black tights and heels to wear to the opera.","March 12, 2016","Date"

The overlay was a little tight and slip is on the shorter side, and I debated wearing the larger size (6), but ended up wearing my normal size (4) and was happy I did. The downside was there was a big white tag on the lace overlap. I recommend bringing a safety pin so you can roll the tag up and pin it so it's less noticeable.","November 21, 2017","True to Size"

I liked the lace overlay print and the uniqueness of the high neck, which made it feel edgier. As other reviewers noted, it is two separate pieces. I rented a 6 and a 4. The size 6 under slip was actually considerably shorter than the size 4, so I wore the 4 slip under the 6 dress for a perfect fit, so definitely recommend getting the free back up size with this to give you that option. It is a little snug in the upper arms, and the fabric doesn't have much give, but it wasn't an issue and I had no problem dancing the night away.

I ordered this thinking the weather would be cooler considering we're late in September, but it ended up being almost 90 degrees so sweating was probably the only issue I had.

I am 5'7 typically wearing a medium (155lbs and 34b) but ended up wearing the large back up size. If you have a pear shape body type like I do, and smaller chest- the dress sorta falls a bit tighter on the hips and leaves a bit more fabric around the stomach than originally preferred. The zipper is cute extra touch in the back but just heads up it does tend to weigh on the back lifting the dress up a bit closer to your neck than I prefer...making the dress a bit shorter for us taller girls. Overall it's a cute dress that you can dress up or dress down depending on the event. I did have to wait to put it on right before I got to the event because the fabric does wrinkle very easily.","June 30, 2019","Small"

I have a petite build - 5'3, 130 lbs. I typically wear a size 4 dress, 6 jeans and 34 B bust. The medium fit perfectly. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star is because it came with a little snag near the lower hem. Not too noticeable but definitely worn - likely well loved.","May 7, 2018","Small"

The zipper worked well and never came undone, which was something I was worried about because, well, RTR's zippers have a reputation. I do wish I ordered an XS, because the top was roomier than expected. Word of caution: I had to wear a slip underneath (and keep my long hair down all day!) to cover up the low cut in the back, which made this dress office appropriate.","April 5, 2018","Work"

It's not tight or clingy, but is definitely cut to flatter through arms and body. There was no bagginess, which makes it a comfortable yet flattering option whether you have a baby bump or not. Was a little worried it would be too short, but I was comfortable all night--felt it was perfect length and didn't ride up. Color was exactly what I expected from seeing it online.

I ordered a medium (I'm 5'3"", 130 lbs, 36DD) but it fit pretty loosely so if I were to rent again, I'd order a small. The color and shape of the sleeves were my favorite features of this dress.

However, this dress made me a believer! Pretty true to size, however it does run a bit on the shorter end. I had planned on wearing the XS, but felt it may be a bit short for a wedding. Went with the S, and felt more comfortable. The fabric feels expensive, and easy to travel with as it doesn't wrinkle easily. The color is gorgeous for a fall outing, and looks good on almost any skin tone. Best thing about it is, you can dress it up or down! I paired it with some black T-strap heels, pretty gold accessories and later in the evening switched into some comfortable booties to dance the night away!

The top is a thick and stretchy material and on one of my rentals it was very stretched out; so much so it had warped the part where the top met the skirt. The bottom half is very light, fun, and airy. Be aware that it is slightly see-through. I wore nude colored spanx and that seemed to be fine. The pleats were more flattering than I anticipated and I ended up getting a handful of complaints through the night. I usually wear an 18/20/2x but ended up having to size down with this dress.","September 2, 2019","Wedding"

I would say it's true to size, I'm in between sizes right now and the smaller one was just a little too tight in the chest area. I would highly recommend this dress, it's been on my ""maybe"" list for a while now and I wish I had rented it even sooner.

I loved that too but the cardigan reduced the flare look. Careful of the flare. It can make you look hippy if you don't have a tiny waist with this one because it only flares to the sides.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL62","Amie","Tight, and so hard to get on by yourself.","I had such a hard time with this dress. It has a corset like lining, with rigid boning all around the rib cage. The zipper was ungodly. I took the dress off, and still had the worst time trying to get it zipped even with it off my body. There are five hooks involved in putting the dress on. It's just not an easy, slip on and go dress. Once I finally got it on, I was incredibly uncomfortable within five minutes, and decided it just wasn't worth it. The fabric is beautiful, and the colors and pattern bold. The 14 runs more like a 10.","July 27, 2019","Small"

I normally wear a 12, and ended up wearing a 14 in this dress. It was TIGHT on the top, but it flares out at the waist, so that's a plus. And it has pockets! The lining of the dress has a bit of tulle to make it puff out, and the one side was missing a layer of tulle, but it didn't effect the look of the dress. I'd rent it again!","December 2, 2018","Party"

My one complaint is that the specific dress I rented had definitely seen better days – the sticky part on the inside of the bodice that helps hold the dress up was very worn, and the zipper had very little black paint left on it. I would say the dress I was sent probably needs to be retired. I have not had this problem with other RtR dresses I've rented.","October 17, 2017","True to Size"

First of all it was over the top comfortable and not to mention IT HAD POCKETS. This was my first time using rtr so I was a little wary of the whole experience but it was so easy I will 100% use it again. The dress was comfortable and for a 34B it only slipped a teeny tiny bit. It was great for dancing and for my first Homecoming I constantly was complimented on the color and the overall style. The back was a challenging to zip up, so my mom had to do it but the fabric held the whole night. The dress has an interior support bra to keep the dress from slipping which helped a lot. Stop now, rent it!","October 15, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL62","Stephanie","#RTR","This dress was beautiful. It was very thick material but perfect for the chilly evening. The only negative was the wires kept poking through the fitted part of the dress. It hit at the top of my ribcage. I have a rather large rib cage area and don't have a full bust. If I had a full bust I would not have been able to wear the dress. Pretty true to size. Pockets were a major perk!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL62","Rachel","The structured bodice makes it figure-flattering, and crinoline under-layer makes it fun!","Since the fabric is stiff and many-layered at the waist band, you MUST have someone strong to help you zipper it. The waist determines the size - this is a size up for me. You don't need a bra due to the boning, but it looks better with one. The elastic band at the top was worn on the dress I received; if the bust wasn't tight fitting, I would have been uncomfortable.","September 17, 2017","Small"

Last week I was expecting my original rental to arrive in Houston on 8/31 for a wedding I was attending in Denver, CO on 9/2 but due to Hurricane Harvey, the package didn't get to me in time. I called RTR and connected with Devin and she went above and beyond to get me a couple of dresses to choose from to be sent overnight to San Antonio since the hurricane brought me there. We spoke at length about the style(s) I tended to gravitate towards as well as what was available in the short time frame. I went with the first dress that she suggested, this Monique Lhullier, and I couldn't be any happier with the dress and with my experience with RTR, specifically Devin. It was quite possibly the one thing that went right amongst all that went wrong in the past 2 weeks. They take the utmost care of their customers and did everything they could to alleviate any stress I had about the rental and the wedding. Thank you to Devin and to RTR for everything!!

It was perfect with a cardigan for the ceremony and dinner and then the strapless helped once I was on the dance floor. It was a bit tight in the waist on me but nothing I couldn't deal with. I don't know if going up a size would have helped as I think the next size up would be too big in the chest since I'm small chested. The length and fullness of the skirt was great for me being tall with wide hips.","July 18, 2017","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NK72","RTR Customer","Beautiful and comfortable.. pockets!","This was the perfect LBD for my company holiday party. The fabric of the dress is nice and heavy feeling. The pockets are awesome! I felt great in the dress. My only complaint was that one of my sizes had small holes in the lace. I didn't notice them when I tried it on, but when I put it on for the event, I noticed several, even one in the front. I had to switch to the smaller size, which was a bit snug but still doable. I think this style is a little too delicate (and the material of the bottom of the dress too heavy) to be hung on the thin hanger that RTR uses, and the dress was clearly showing its wear (lots of happy ladies have worn this dress, apparently!). My other complaint is that even though the dresses have clearly been dry cleaned, they still smell a little gross! All in all, very happy with the final outcome, and RTR handled it well. Just beware and be prepared that sometimes the dresses show wear when you get them.","January 16, 2019","True to Size"

This was the back up style I chose so I only had one size. Also, POCKETS! Who doesn't love a dress with pockets?! I didn't have to worry about my cell phone falling out because the pockets were deep.

I paired the dress with big earrings, no necklace and a simple bracelet. The bodice doesn't have much give in the material so be sure to include a back-up size. I didn't wear a bra and felt completely comfortable all day. The skirt is full and quite flattering! The lace on the top is stunning! The dress is overall quite simple, extremely flattering and just gorgeous. I got so many compliments on it! My husband wanted me to keep it. I highly recommend this dress and look forward to renting it again.","May 13, 2017","Wedding"

I was apprehensive about renting a dress without knowing how it fit, but everyone in the reviews looked good and said it fit well. I'm glad I chose this dress as my first rental. I probably could have worn either the 4 or the 6 for this dress. I typically wear size 6 but the 6 became unavailable right before the wedding. The fabric has a lot of give, and the 4 worked very well. I was glad the dress was a bit thicker since it ended up being a cool fall day on a mountain. It was so comfortable for dancing in all night, I didn't even want to take it off by the end of the night. Overall, the dress was so much fun, and I was very happy with it! I really didn't experience any downsides. I'd be tempted to buy it if I had the chance.","October 24, 2018","True to Size"

That said, this dress was perfect! At the very last minute, I was shipped a size 16 dress. I'm 5'10, 38D, normally wear a size 14 dress, so I was nervous about the reviews that it runs large, and it does - i had plenty of room in the hips and waist. I could have worn the 14 and it would have been a more fitted dress, but honestly it was still great. Great length, nice weight to dress, lots of room to move, sit, and dance. I absolutely love this dress, and if I get the change to purchase it (in the right size) I wouldn't hesitate to do it!","October 5, 2016","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM251","RTR Customer","First time user of RTR and am so happy!","I had two dresses delivered sizes 4 & 6. Oddly enough the size 6 was more of a snug fit (particularly around the bust) than the size 4. It has two linings in the dress so it felt good and covered up the little lump and bumps. It did sit very strangely at the bottom of the zip leaving a bulging look. This was the same on both of the dresses so I'd say it has something to do with the fabric. I enjoyed wearing this frock and I loved how easy it is to use RTR! Can't wait to hire my next dress! Thankyou Team RTR.","August 29, 2016","Wedding"

The dress is well-made and feels great on the body--flattering and comfortable. I received a lot of compliments and really felt amazing wearing it. It fits fairly true to size (I wear a 6 or an 8 depending). I ended up wearing the six even though it was a tad more snug because the 8 was just a teeny bit loose in the bust. Some reviews mentioned the lace was a (little) bit worn and that was true of the 6--especially along the bottom. But only noticeable because I was looking for it. The fabric near the zipper's bottom is just a teeny bit thick, so it will bunch a bit right at that spot--but once I was in the dress and moving around, it never bothered me. The dress came a day later than promised but I wasn't worried since I had read the reviews and felt confident one of the two sizes I ordered would fit. I don't think you'll regret renting this one--seriously a comfortable flattering fit.","May 15, 2016","Other"

There was a bit of a lump where the zipper ended at my hip, so watch out for that. I wore a 0, which is my standard size, and had plenty of wiggle room.

Ideally I would have ordered a 6L and 8R, but those sizes/lengths were not available. 6R was just slightly too tight where the clasp meets on the back; needed help zipping and clasping. But it wasn't too uncomfortably tight that I couldn't stand it throughout the evening. Sleeves are slightly tight but doable. 6R length was a little shorter than I would have liked but definitely not too short! Highly recommend!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM189","Samantha","Loved it!","Wore this to a gala and it was perfect! I'm usually cold at this event every year, but the thick material kept me warm all night. It is a little revealing in the chest, but not enough to be uncomfortable or feel like you're going to pop out with any move. I wore a sticky bra and was able to wear spanx, even with the open back. My only complaint is that the seam had a small tear that got bigger with every move. I sewed it up and it was good for the rest of the night but noticed there was another one on the hip by the end of the night. The material is thick, but you could see where its had to be fixed here and there. Other than that - it's an amazing dress!","March 1, 2018","Formal Affair"

They told me to walk into the RTR store in NYC and they will help me find a dress not to worry. This is the first time I used RTR and i was a bit unhappy. I walked into the store and it was a bit busy. I waited to see someone at the counter to explain my situation and the girl was so understanding and helpful. She asked Andrew to help me look for a dress and they nailed it! I walked in overwhelmed and stressed out it was only 5 hours before the wedding and I left the store extreamly happy at ease and with a stunning dress. The website was disappointing but the store staff in Manhattan flagship store was amazing they provided inpecible customer service. The dress was perfect I received compliments all night.","February 15, 2018","Wedding"

I have to say though that I was so disappointed when i tried on the 0 regular. It wasnt fitted, the waist and sleeves hung off of me and there was no support in the bust either. Overall unflattering. Must have been super stretched out by other renters who probably should have sized up. The 0 long fit like a glove and i had enough support in the bust that no bra was necessary.

Taking off a star because it doesn't really seem like it's made for larger-chested women - the fabric was stretched pretty taut across my bust and the girls definitely felt a little squished. I don't think it was noticeable to anyone but me, but the tightness in that area kept the dress from being as comfortable as it could have been had it been cut just a touch more generously up there.

This dress made me feel so girly and I loved the pattern on it. It reminded me of a Sunday Brunch or a an Easter dress due to the color pattern, and I would definitely keep this style in mind for future family events that are more conservative. Fit and flare is always my favorite dress style, and since the fabric on this dress was a little bit more stiff, it really held the shape of the skirt and made it that much more feminine. I would recommend sizing up if you are busty, since there is no stretch and you may have more cleavage showing. The hips are not fitted which is great for hourglass or pear shaped figures.

I can sway between a 0 or 2 depending on designer, but I'm mostly a 0. The 0 on this dress was very tight at the waist seam and caused the skirt to bunch out. Luckily I ordered the 2 as a backup, but then the straps were too long (typical with my 5'1"" height). I was able to fashion tape the front and hold it in place, but you could still tell from the back the straps were too long. I know this stuff can happen with renting, but it rarely happens with the experiences I've had, so I was a bit disappointed.

This wasn't available in my preferred size (L) so I tried XL hoping it would work since wrap dresses can be so flexible. Unfortunately, I couldn't make the bust work; I'm small chested to begin with so stepping up a size was too much. That said, despite it being too big overall, it was also quite short and the fluttery part of the sleeves hung strangely - almost abrupt rather than flowy.

The blue is very beautiful and eye catching in person. I had purchased some Spanx for the occasion since it is kind of a clingy fit, but it didn't end up working out because the back bottom slit exposed it whenever I walked.

As with other lacy-type dresses I've rented from RTR, I found that some parts of the dress look a little more worn or frayed around the edges -- of course you have to look pretty close to see that, but just something worth mentioning. I did not wear a bra with this because of the low back. The waist/middle- section was fairly snug, and the fabric does not really have much give to it. For this reason, I would recommend sizing up just in case. I received quite a few compliments on the look. This dress made me feel very sophisticated and classy, yet still quite sexy with the low back.","June 24, 2018","Wedding"

As mentioned in other reviews, the clasps were fixed and they were not loose at all. I had no problems with them. I noticed in other reviews there were comments about wear and tear on the dress and that it looked worn at the armpits, however the dress I wore looked brand new.","January 29, 2018","True to Size"

I got a 2 and 4, and I wore the 2 (which is my normal size). It's worth noting that the 4 was actually a different shade - more of a dark periwinkle as opposed to a true royal blue - but they were both gorgeous. I only noticed when they were side by side. It did feel a little worn, but because of the lace overlay, any fraying wasn't noticeable because the pattern is very busy anyway. But it was super comfortable and not tight in any spots, it fit wonderfully (and I truly mean that, I won't wear anything if it's the slightest bit too tight or uncomfortable).","September 25, 2017","True to Size"

The 2 would've worked but having a shorter torso and a little more jelly on my lower abdomen, it made me look a lot chunkier because of where the waist hit, even though it was just as comfortable. I would have been tugging on the waistline all night and it made my butt look bombastic from behind! Overall, it was super cute and comfy, fancy enough for my work auction even when I switched to flats, and POCKETS! I carried my phone around and it didn't pull anything down. I wore a strapless bra because even though there are strap holders in the sleeves, it didn't keep regular bra straps from showing in the back, and that was my only issue with this dress!","June 12, 2019","True to Size"

I rented the 8. I don't really know what size I am any longer, as I have lost between 65-70 lbs over the past 18 months. I am sort, so the dress was just barely above the knee, and it was appropriate for a work event. If this came in purple, I would buy it in an instant. Also...IT HAS POCKETS and didn't look goofy with lipstick in one pocket and my phone in the other.","November 18, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH111","Allison","Can't go wrong!","Such a great dress. Starting with the beautiful blue-jewel tone. the shimmer to it isn't sequins, so no worries it's not flashy at all, just classy. the top was nice and fitted... the back is an elastic material, so you didn't feel like you were in a straight-jacket. the shoulder straps have little loops to hold your bra straps in, so I could just wear my normal favorite bra. the stitching around the waistline gave a little... so again... didn't feel like a straight jacket. and the bottom flared out to cover my mom belly. was a little shorter than I usually go with, but I still felt very covered and it didn't look like i was trying too hard (I'm 5'7""). Material isn't scratchy at all. Can't say enough great things. i'm usually a solid size 8, and the 6 fit great.... probably could've made a 4 work as well, but that's because my weight/size is in my hips... not my bust. would absolutely rent this one again.","October 21, 2018","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH111","Elizabeth","Great rental especially for the price! Festive but not over the top, and comfortable!","Chose this dress for an early-fall, semi-formal wedding. It was a great choice and I really enjoyed wearing it. The metallic blue is an elegant shade, and the sparkle is fairly understated, ensuring that the dress is elegant - the sparkle also dresses up a style that could be casual in a different fabric (I also styled with gold heels and bigger jewelry to ensure it would be dressy enough). Dress is super comfortable and has pockets. It does run a bit big - I am normally a 0 or 2 and 2 was way too big. 0 mostly worked, but the bodice could have been a little more fitted, especially on my smaller 32B bust. Also, no need for a strapless bra, so that's a win. Would happily wear again.","September 11, 2018","Large"

It was super comfortable all evening and I didn't have to worry about a thing,...including my bra straps because the were securely fastened to the dress. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

Wanted to wear neutral shoes originally, but the black ended up working better. There was a black panel on the back above the waist seam, and with the undertones and shimmer of the dress it just seemed to work better with black.

This might be good for someone looking to add some volume. I didn't need added volume, but the dress still looked cute. I did have to wear a shaper underneath to prevent the skirt portion from puffing out too much. I had a baby 4 months ago, so I have some extra fluff there right now.

It was a fight to get it over my belly and just wasn't flattering once on because it was so tight. The dress isn't meant to be tight so I thought sizing up to a medium would more than compensate but it still didn't work. It fit well in the chest, arms and shoulders so I feel like a large may look too baggy up top on me.

I could not even zip up the 4R and the 6R was quite tight for me. You can see I am spilling out of the skirt a little. Overall, it was just too uncomfortable to wear all night long, which is why I decided against wearing it. I suggest sizing up from what you think you should order as your backup at least. The material is very thick and I had concerns about dancing all night (and sweating profusely) as well. Length was good though - I have on 2.5"" heels in the photos.","December 9, 2019","Small"

I was worried being a pear-shaped woman that this wouldn't be flattering, but it fit like a glove (be it a very, very tight glove). It was a backup option for my original dress selections, and I was *this* close to wearing it, but I chose another backup option that was a bit lighter of fabric and more flowy. I didn't want to give this back though! I felt so sexy in it and it perfectly accentuated my curves! If I had the money, I'd buy it so I could have it forever. Pear-shaped babes, jump on this! Note though: the chest is very small, which worked for my body shape but probably wouldn't be good for women with larger than a B cup unless they wanted to size up.","August 17, 2019","Formal Affair"

I was looking for a dress with conservative cutouts that was form fitting for a winter gala and this dress was all of that and more! I typically go between a 4 and 6 in gowns. Based on the reviews about the dress leaning tight, I went with the 6R (as the 4 was unavailable) and it fit perfectly! I never found the dress to be too tight, even after eating and drinking. I found the cutouts very flattering and that, combined with the high slit, very sexy. The dress was comfortable and I could dance throughout the night! Additional bonus- the cutouts were low enough on my build that I could wear a strapless bra. The dress is constructed well enough that you don't need to wear Spanx, but I did just for the seamless lines. I'm 5'3 and wore 3 inch heels and the dress grazed the ground.

This dress is classy and sophisticated while the side slots give a sexy appeal. I normally wear a 6, and rented a 6R and 10R because there weren't any 8s left. I ultimately decided on the 10R because it gave me enough room through the back. I'm a crossfit coach, so I have a wide upper back and chest. The length was a perfect fit for my 5'3"" height while wearing 4"" heels. I was able to dance and move around comfortably all night.","January 23, 2019","Formal Affair"

But the second I put it on, I felt as if it fit me so perfectly, it actually made me look and feel 10 pounds lighter! I was amazed! The material is thick with some stretch. I wore 3.5"" heels and it just touched the floor. I wore a 4R. I danced all night long without a hitch. I would definitely wear this dress again. As an FYI- I tried it with spanx but ended up not needing them- but it was just as comfy and you couldn't tell i had spanx on underneath (if anyone is curious).

At 5'3"" with 4"" heels the dress was a perfect length, my toes just peeked out and it didn't drag at all. It was extremely comfortable to wear all night and I received soooo many compliments. Though it is tight on your thighs, the slits on each side make it easy to dance the night away. One detail that surprised me was that it's made out of a canvas like fabric and the color looked slightly faded on the straps. I think that's just the style because both the sizes I ordered appeared that way. Though I wore my hair down so that wasn't a big issue.","August 28, 2018","Wedding"

But there are a few drawbacks. The material is incredibly heavy, so if you're a fan of dancing at weddings, be prepared to sweat. Additionally, the cut outs on the side hit in a weird place, and I was always self conscious that it would make it look like I have fat rolls. The dress also runs a little short, so if you're 5'8"" and up, the L might not be long enough. Overall, if you rent it, definitely size up.

It's a show-stopper - tons of compliments all night. It was comfortable, easy to wear, but it's not for someone who needs a lot of bust support - I don't know how a strapless bra would work with this. It was easy to sit down and eat during the wedding, and it was so much fun to dance in it! The slits make it easy to walk and move. The dress I got was a bit worn out and clearly had been worn one too many times, but it's a gorgeous color and hugs every curve.

I'm normally a 2/4 and ordered a 4 for this dress, it fit perfectly, but a 2 would have been too small for sure.

It hit 2 or 3 inches above my knees but, since it was tight, it rode up when I sat down. I will absolutely rent again. The experience was wonderful, hassle-free, and the dress was great.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HP74","D","Looks great in photos!","Wow this dress is tight - I do feel like it runs true to size though because it fit me perfectly on top - I didn't feel like I was restricted with my breathing or eating - but on the bottom WOW - it's basically hard to really function in this dress - it's hard to sit or walk (I can't imagine dancing). Thankfully I wore this dress for a birthday dinner with the hubby, so we only walked a few steps, in and out of cabs, and I sat for the entirety of the meal. The dress is so tight though, it's hard to find a comfortable position and my leg fell asleep! Also I don't think going to the bathroom was an option in this dress, since I don't think I could've lifted the dress above my hips :-S I would NOT recommend this dress unless you plan on standing motionless for an entire event. I had the size 2 as a backup, but the reason I wore the 0 anyway, was 1) The 2 still had the same problem on the bottom of the dress, it was just looser on top, and 2) it was clearly extremely worn, and the lace felt a little torn up in areas - I think RTR should retire that specific size that I received. Another last note - everyone is right about the lining, it does hang below the lace on top but I honestly fixed that so easily by tucking it under - the dress is so tight it didn't move or roll down.","November 5, 2015","True to Size"

The lower back cut out gives an extra bit of sexy - it was a hot day for the wedding so this helped me get some air too!","May 29, 2018","True to Size"

The XS would have worked but I preferred the length of the S and that it allowed for some give around my neck. I didn't wear a bra and it was fine.

I wish the size when up to an XL. The material of the dress is very stretchy and the shape is flattering for all heights.

I thought the slim skirt on the dress would be restricting but it, along with the rest of the dress, is a comfortable, stretchy material. I was able to wear Spanx with it, but if you want the full dramatic look of the low back with the ruffle, it may be a tad more difficult!

I was worried about the length since I'm pretty short (5'1"") but I feel like it looked really good. I chose a nude heel in order to avoid cutting myself up and accentuating my height. The ruffles were a fun touch. The material is thick, but not constricting thick, and depending on what undies you wear, you'll be able to see them. I wore pasties and a no-show thong and was okay. I'd definitely recommend this dress, but do think the length would be better on someone a few inches taller.","October 18, 2017","True to Size"

The dress is really comfortable and has a lot of stretch, so while form-fitting I was able to dance all night and walk (including taking the stairs) without feeling constricted. The ruffles and length are v trendy, and I was shocked that with my 5'2 frame the dress didn't hit me at a weird spot! If I had a real critique I kind of wish it was a different color than black. I also wish I could've worn a bra with this, but feel like it would've been seen with the ruffle back.

The thick material and ruching flawlessly hides lumps and bumps. I'm very busty and often have trouble finding cocktail dresses; I was a bit tentative because the description said the dress is best for A-C cup sizes but I had a hunch it would work, and it did. The neckline was really flattering, no cleavage pouring out on top or my underarms. I wore a longline bra (the only way I can do strapless actually have chest support), and the ruching hid the boning/seams very well. The straps shifted on the shoulders a bit over the course of the night and needed to be adjusted but that didn't bother me too much. My only complaint is that the zipper was totally stuck. I couldn't get it back up after trying it on. My husband was finally able to zip it (with a lot of difficulty) and I was afraid if I unzipped it I'd never get it up again. Luckily I was able to step into it because of the stretch and cut of the dress. Just a heads up for you size 10s!","August 21, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH231","Lisa","Lovely burgundy lace dress for a formal work event!","I really enjoyed wearing this dress! It was perfect for a work event that was happening right around the holidays. I'm pretty short (5 ft) and the dress hit a few inches above my knees, which is awesome, because usually dresses that are meant to be a bit shorter are nearly floor length on me (haha). It's nice to balance a conservative top with a shorter length, so I'm glad it wasn't too long on me. I ordered a size 2 and a size 4, I went with the 2 and found that it fit me perfectly, not too snug, not too loose. I wore this with some tights and black booties to give it a little bit more of a festive holiday look. The only major downside with this dress was that it is two pieces, a slip, and then the lace dress that goes over the slip. I found that the slip kept awkwardly shifting throughout the night, and I didn't really notice until I would go look in a mirror and see that it wasn't centered on my body any more... it just kind of moved however it wanted to. Nothing too bad, just made for a little bit of an ""uneven"" look if I wasn't paying attention to it. Other than the slip shifting, there were a few (very minor) flaws in the dress. The lace had a tiny hole in the front, and some areas were unraveling, just very minor though. Someone else on here mentioned that the arms were snug... I would definitely keep that in mind, this lace is not very stretchy at all. However, if you have smaller arms, you'll be fine. Overall, I enjoyed this dress, I thought it was a perfect winter dress for a formal event!","December 17, 2019","True to Size"

It was so forgiving and the lines laid perfectly on places I wanted to hide, but was so flattering to my long legs. I ordered the size 6 and 8 after reading the reviews that recommended sizing up and I'm glad I did. The size 6 was too tight on my arms. The size 8 was perfect and fit loosely around my mid-section so I didn't have to worry about hiding anything. I got tons of compliments on how gorgeous it was. It was soft and warm on a cold night. I highly recommend this dress and I'll probably rent it again.

I wore it to a wedding and it made me feel great. I normally wear a 2 but wanted a slightly tighter fit, so I went with the size 0. The slip for the 0 was too short so I actually wore the size 2 slip with the 0 dress and it worked out really well. The sleeves felt snug at first but I got used to them quickly and they weren't uncomfortable. Overall, great dress and great experience.","January 29, 2019","True to Size"

It runs a bit short for my liking though and if I wasn’t wearing tights I probably wouldn’t have worn it. It’s also tight in the arms with no give. The neckline of the dress rubs up against your collarbone and there is no way of pulling the dress down to stop it from rubbing. The size 4 was a bit better in the arms and neckline but it hung too lose on my body and it gave me no shape so I went with the 2","October 28, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH231","Courtney","Lots of compliments!","I ordered this dress in a size 4 and size 6. The overall shape of the dress is kind of boxy and not form fitting. I wanted something kinda loose in the midsection because I'm self-conscious of my stomach so I was ok with this. The 6 was too big and too boxy and the sleeves were kind of long. The 4 fit better without it being too tight, the dress is 2 pieces; a slip and the ""lace"" overylay. Only its not lace; it's more of a crochet material and has NO give. My biggest complaint about this dress is the neckline. It came up pretty high to my neck and since the material is kind of rough and doesn't move much, I actually had two red, chafed spots on my neck. 4 days later I can still see where it rubbed and its not because it was too tight!

Unfortunately it came with a hole/tear on the stomach that was very obvious when I had the dress on. I opted wearing the 6 (pictured) because of this.

Neither thing ruined the night, but I thought it was worth mentioning. I have athletic arms & was worried the sleeves would be too tight but they were great!

Next time o rent dress trough my RTR Unlimited Subscription I will order a size up. Do not rent this dress if you have a full chest bc it will pull across the breast area and make your boobs look squished! I am a 34 D and had to change my bra & wear a bra that wasn't padded & it fit just fine. Also, do not rent this dress if you have wide huge hips /large bottom area because the pockets on the side of dress will stick out and it will not look right. I feel this dress will look best on someone who has a straight and narrow body. I could see bump on my lower belly area and did not care, I should have wore spanks but dress was too short so in winter I will rent this dress with control top black tights.

RTR informed me a few days prior to delivery that there was an issue with the size 42, so they sent me a back up dress just in case the size 44 didn't work. The size 44 was slightly big, but it didn't deter me from wearing it for the event I was attending. The only issue is that the lining kept coming down past the hemline of the dress.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MB6","Anna","Would buy this dress if I could","I borrowed sizes 44 and 46. Although the 44 fit me, it made my tummy look a bit big. I think it was the shape of the chest area, the design flattened the chest and the overall dress shape looked like a pear. The 46 was loose and I looked thinner, if that made any sense, which meant the dress was longer on me. Although the dress did not look like how it is on the model, I thought it was still rich-looking. The material is definitely thick. It was perfect for a lunch wedding in cool weather. I think because of the material, it would be too hot for summer. I wore the dress with black tights and platform sandals and brought a shawl instead of a coat because of the bell sleeves. I think the sleeves added drama to the dress. Love it! I am contemplating on borrowing it again for a holiday party.","November 9, 2015","Large"

I rented a size 8 (46) and a size 10 (48), and the size 8 (46) fit me with no issues. The sleeves weren't tight and had enough room to easily get in and out of. I am 5'4 and the dress stopped a few inches above my knees. The chest area did fit a little snug so keep that in mind if you have a bigger chest. The black lining of the dress wasn't sewn down to the dress hem so it would sometimes slip out when I walked but I used some safety pins to help keep it in place. The dress material is thick so I wouldn't recommend wearing this for an outdoor event in the summer because you will be hot in it. Overall this was a nice dress and I would consider renting it again for an event!","August 3, 2015","True to Size"

It's super comfortable and has large pockets that was so useful. I got tons of compliments from friends and family. I normally wear a size 10 and so I got a size 48. Unfortunately the back up size (46 or 8 US) was not available. I would have fit the smaller size better, but I had to deal with what I had. I had a small belt to wrap around my waist and it worked well (I'd also recommend a decorative cinch fit clip/back dress clip if you run into this problem.) It does run on the shorter side than what I usually wear, so I wore short length slip shorts over my stockings just in case. Overall, love it and nothing I couldn't solve. :)","March 12, 2020","Large"

I'm only 5'0 tall but it was actually almost too short on me, so taller girls beware! It went down to about 4 inches above my knees and good thing I LOVE short dresses! Definitely not for a warm day as the material is thick. The front is a brocade-like heavy material and the back has a nice stretch to it. The pockets are EVERYTHING!

Surprisingly you couldn’t even notice as it’s very structured. I’m not a huge fan of the fit. I think it adds volume even if you were a very skinny person bc of some awkward pleating around the waist...since I have more of an athletic figure it just wasn’t the most flattering.

I was concerned it would be too green and Christmasy, but it definitely wasn't. Another concern was what bra to wear with it. There is a built in bra that helps with support. Personally didn't feel it was enough. I was able to wear regular nude bra. It was low enough at the back that it didn't show. Straps were not visible through the lace. I felt great in it and highly recommend!","May 11, 2017","Wedding"

Unfortunately I can't wear it, because at 5'7, it's barely covering anything while standing. I wouldn't be able to wear this out and easily sit or move around without worrying about flashing everyone. I'd recommend it for more petite ladies.","May 24, 2017","Everyday"

The fabric is on the thicker side so probably not a good idea on a hot day. (Today's weather was perfect 70's). I LOVED the pockets!! Only issue was the color.

I wore a bra with a clear strap - regular straps looked bad in the front slits. My only complaint is that RTR's dry cleaning did not totally erase the body odor of whoever rented it before me. It was really strong even after I sprayed the dress with perfume and aired it out for a day. If it wasn't for that this dress would have been my favorite rental yet.","July 28, 2016","Everyday"

The slits at the top were not too much, and I was able to wear a regular nude bra, and you couldn't tell. I wore the same kind of shoes as shown in the picture, but you could easily pair it with wedges, or even flats, and it would work great for a wedding, party, anything!

However, I felt that this particular style ran more ""true to size"" than other E&J styles. Usually I advise people to order 1 size (or 2 sizes) up, but for this particular dress, I don't think its necessary (its also possible that the dress had been stretched out a bit from other renters) And while most E&J dresses allow me to go bra-less, this color made it a little too obvious...and with the unique neck/shoulder line, a strapless or NuBra will do the trick. Still a great dress & received lots of compliments...especially on the color.","June 5, 2019","True to Size"

It's a pretty, light blue dress that was perfect for the occasion. The straps/top of the dress make it not so plain. Being short, I'm always conscious of where dresses hit me because it can make me look shorter; this dress hit nicely above the knee while not being short enough to be worrisome of it flying up or anything when dancing. I would rent another E&J dress again in a heartbeat!","January 17, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ48","RTR Customer","Fit for the occasion","I ordered the 2 with a 4 as my backup size as I read from previous reviews that it runs small, and I am rather busty for a petite woman. However, I think I could have probably gone for the 0 as the 2 was a little loose but not visibly so. The dress is lined so it's a little on the thicker side, giving it some weight (no need to worry about gusts of wind) and it definitely looked formal enough for such a simple dress.

I am normally a 0 or 2 depending on the brand. The night before my delivery I got an email that the 4 I was expecting wouldn't be coming with my order because it was returned damaged by the previous renter and was SO nervous. Turns out, the 2 fit perfectly! The cut was SO flattering; I loved the color. And the dress was SO COMFORTABLE. the dress is thick enough to hold you in place but has decent stretch, so after a couple drinks and a meal I didn't feel like it was too tight. I couldn't be happier with the whole experience. I'm very short, so didn't find length to be an issue (tho the skirt does fly up a little if you spin while dancing) ...and it did show some sweat after a night on the dance floor (at an outdoor wedding in August) I wish I could've kept this dress forever and I will definitely rent another Elizabeth& James dress soon!","August 31, 2016","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM205","RTR Customer","Pretty dress, fit was so-so","Pros: This dress was a great color, and had a thickness to it that made it dressier than your average cocktail dress. Worked well for this event (charity dinner and auction). I liked the off the shoulder look, and the length was fine. It hit me a little above the knee, and I'm 5'11. The material is structured but had a lot of stretch. Cons: I noticed before putting it on that the seam on both sizes was coming apart. One size it was down the middle, and on the other size it was on the side. Being 32 weeks pregnant, it was noticeable that the seam was open once I put the dress on. I used fashion tape and was able to hide it pretty well. The sizing was a little annoying. I specifically searched using the ""maternity"" and ""third trimester"" filter, and found this one. I went up several sizes but it still was pretty tight, I would've liked to go up one more. The order arrived after the return window so they couldn't send a new one. So that was a bummer. I still made the dress work, and it was fine, but definitely tight by the end of the night. I didn't even take a picture in it, just got out of that thing as quick as possible. I do have a picture from when I was trying it on though. If pregnant, this dress will work but make sure to go up SEVERAL sizes. I am usually a 0 or 2, and wore a 6. I would've liked to have had an 8, just for some extra belly space.","October 30, 2017","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/OS62","Leanne","I wish I could've given this 5 stars, but....Read my Details Review.","I quickly found this LBD in store, and it wasn't until I tried it on, did I fall in love with the design details (this is why couture reigns supreme): it has a peek-a-boo neckline, side slits on both legs, an open back portal cut, and it has a drawstring at the base of the portal cut, that you can tie into a bow, to tighten the torso and back, which I thought was another darling touch. It fit my body like a glove. Not once did I have to adjust the hemline! It was only when, a few hours later, I changed into this dress, did I discover the zipper had come off the track midway at the bust line seam, and there was no fixing it. The takeaway: It's a fresh design on the classic LBD, and has the versatility to be your OOTD/IRL, for your date night or a dress you'd wear to a special event. I absolutely loved this dress: it's a bummer about the zipper issue.","January 25, 2020","True to Size"

But a 16 fit well in this line (currently a 10/12). The upper back gaps so you can see the tag. And you can see bra straps through the arm openings so wear no bra, strapless or at least a nude bra. Fabric is cool- sturdy but flexible. Also my dress didn't have the strings hanging down the front. I liked the look of that in front and back and for whatever reason mine didn't have that detail in the front. Regretted wearing this dress to my event like 5 mins after putting it on. It worked out okay but would never get this again.","April 6, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EF116","Brianne","Loved the bow!","Like other reviews said, this dress is EXTREMELY tight in the rib cage area. I simply could not eat at the wedding. The bigger size fit better, but the bust area was just so large that you could see everything. The side boob area is not very forgiving. Overall, I received a ton of compliments on this dress and I loved how it made me feel. The skirt is very full and princessy and I absolutely adored the bow detail in the back, so I had a ton of fun wearing it (while standing up). Sitting down in this dress was another story. If you are bigger chested, I would encourage ordering a size up. As much as I loved this dress, I probably would not order it again simply because it was either entirely too small in the rib cage area or entirely too large in the bust area.","September 19, 2018","Small"

I'm very color coordinated conscious. Wanted a formal yet casual classic chic dress for the 60th Anniversary Gala of the Tempel Lippizans. Riders from Chile's Classical Riding School flew in. I wanted to represent both American and Chile flags with a navy blue, plus the Tempel rider's uniforms are a dark royal blue. Unfortunately it was 63° and raining for part, so I was quite cold. Loved the pockets. Very well constructed of heavy material. Great lining. I am a 32 A/AA with a 24"" waist and very small ribcage. Wore the 2 as the 0 wasn't available. Still very roomy in the bust and under the arms and upper ribcage. (Was going to have my mom do a slipsitch to tuck the excess fabric but wound up not.) I wore a super padded VS Add 2 Cups Bombshell bra just to barely fill it out. Not a dress for A or B cup women!!! Don't know why people say you can't wear a bra as a strapless is easily hidden. Could even wear a T-back bra. Would definitely buy. Want to ask RTR if they'd sell it to me as I can't find it online anywhere to purchase.","August 10, 2018","Large"

The color is dreamy, and the cut on top was quite flattering — I didn’t end up with that pesky armpit fat problem. The shape of the dress was also very forgiving on the belly. The back was really cute, so I wore my hair in a wavy ponytail. Because of the back, I thought I’d have to wear a Nubra or pasties, but I ended up without a bra at all and the material was thick enough so it was fine. I’m usually between a 6 and 8, and the two sizes were pretty similar. The 8 was just a bit loose around the collar, the 6 sat flatter. I wish it was a bit shorter, it was a lot of skirt.

This dress fit perfectly. It wasn't too tight, felt more like a shift dress, the fabric was very comfortable. It was the perfect length and I wasn't pulling at my dress all night. If there was dancing I'm sure I would've been comfortable (but alas no dancing at this event). I only wish that I had paired it with a large colorful necklace (which I unfortunately don't have) but I made it work with other accessories.

My only complaint was it was a little short and tight at the bottom, and I felt like it kept riding up especially when I sat down. Tights are basically a must...or just be very careful.","December 21, 2019","Party"

I am definitely larger on the bottom of my body than the top and this dress had more than enough room. The arms were also super flattering and not too tight. I was super sad to send this one back.

This dress is great. The neckline highlights the shoulders and the crepe fabric drapes in a lovely way. It was a little hard to find a bra to wear because the arm holes were so low. They showed every strapless one I own. I opted for a black sports bra with thin straps. The only thing that kept me from keeping this in my closet was the sizing. It felt more like a 14 than a 12. I think I should have sized down given the volume of fabric, but worry about the length and neck size. I wore it casually, but people kept asking me why I was dressed up.

I paired it with a tank top to keep things reigned in, and added navy tieks because none of my other shoes fit by then....

However, I did have some issues with the the way the top of the bodice is cut. Every bra I tried on with it, ended up showing on the side of the dress. It could have been because I have a short torso, but I ended up having to make do without a bra. The other thing that was odd was that there was almost no difference in size between the 4 and the 6, other than the 6 had slightly more room in the chest. I ended up wearing the 4, but if I had worn the 6, it would have looked pretty much the same on me.","May 10, 2018","True to Size"

The dress has pockets that are perfect for holding big phones (I have an iPhone 7 Plus). I miss this dress already, and may even rent it again!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW284","Amanda","This dress was amazing!","The fabric was soft and high quality. The dress fit really well at the waist and was a good length - not too short that I had to worry but not to long to make my body look shorter than it already is. It was a little big in the chest but not dramatically so, and it fit so well everywhere else that it didn't matter. I wore this to my cousin's wedding","September 25, 2017","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW284","Sarah","I wore this dress to one of my friends weddings and everyone kept complimenting it!","This dress was perfect for a wedding; super comfortable and easy to move around in. I picked this dress because I've worn similar styles before so I knew I'd luck out. I loved the colors as well. I ordered the size 2 and size 4 and wore the size 2 because the top fit better. I contemplated not wearing a bra because the top has a different cut to it, but ended up criss-crossing my straps in the back and it worked out perfectly! This is my first time using RTR and it did not disappoint.","September 5, 2017","True to Size"

I would say it runs a little big - I very consistently wear an 8 in dresses and the 8 of this dress was just a little bit baggy in the top. Pockets = everything, got tons of compliments, also I'm pretty tall (5'10"") and this wasn't too short at all (always my fear with dresses). Would definitely recommend and even rent again, would just get a smaller size next time!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW284","RTR Customer","Great daytime fancy casual dress.","Great dress - the fit and stretch were perfect - nice heavy fabric. Only thing I found odd (which is just the style that I didn't see before ordering) is the straps are cut very square (instead of round between your boob and armpit) so you can see your bra on the side, but isn't a big deal as long as you're not wearing a hot pink bra.","July 18, 2017","True to Size"

I wore a strapless bra because the neckline is a little weird, but I didn't have to adjust much at all. Added a belt since I like my waist well defined, and got lots of compliments. The dress is made of neoprene aka scuba material which threw me off at first but ended up totally great. And the pockets were a great bonus :)","July 3, 2017","Wedding"

After running from registration for the event to the stage to run the raffle, and then dancing, I was sweating like I ran a marathon! The fabric in the bodice retained all of that moisture, and it was still damp the next morning! It was super fun to wear and I would rent it again!","December 16, 2019","Party"

The waist has no stretch so be aware of that, but generous in the hips and chest. I did have to wear a racerback bra, which worked perfectly. The details of the skirt were so fun and different, plus the pockets are an awesome addition. I felt the length was good for me, but I'm only around 5'3"" so be aware of this if you are super tall. I would definitely rent this again!","September 22, 2019","Wedding"

Very comfortable and you can wear a racerback bra. It was a little shorter than I expected and is a littler higher up on the waistline which is why I decided to wear a belt. If you carry all your weight in your tummy, as I do, you'll prob want a belt otherwise it's a little less flattering. the pockets are a huge plus and the dress looks gorgeous in person. The necklace was a RTR too and I loved it.","May 8, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HTC1","Allyson","Perfect except the ZIPPER!!!","Since most of the reviews said the fit was small I tried on the 8 first (i had gotten a 6 and an 8). After several attempts by both myslef and my husband we finally got the zipper up. The fit was ok but it hung low under the arm pits and was bunchy in the waist. I tried on the 6 and I could tell the fit would be much better but we could NOT get the zipper over the seam!! The night of the Christmas party I had planned to wear it to i had my zipper give the zipper a try and after several attempts she got it up!! I got tons of compliments, it was super comfortable, but it couldve been a disaster rental if the zipper didnt eventually go over the seam. So rent with caution- make sure you have someone to help you with the zipper!! I would rent this again except for that.","December 4, 2017","Party"

I received so many compliments. I am always a little cautious of wearing dresses like this because I'm afraid that it will make ""The Girls"" look bigger than they already are (42DDD) but this dress didn't do that. It runs try to size. The skirt was a good length. I'm on the tall side (5'8"") so I did have to be careful with the back but it was totally worth it. AND IT HAS POCKETS WHILE I LOVE. The only con I would say is the zipper at fabric change. I had to have help getting it zipped up and zipped down.","September 13, 2017","Wedding"

Pros: super comfortable with pockets, I'm 5ft tall so it hit me above my knee so I could wear my spanx without it peeking it out, it was a gorgeous puffy skirt so it was very forgiving whenever I was dancing silly.

These were the things I liked about it; 1- true to size and did not require shape-wear! 2- pockets!!! 3- length was appropriate and since the neckline was high I didn't have to worry about cleavage. What I didn't like about it was the metallic blue color in a few stripes in the skirt. I always feel like metallic threads give a cheap ""night club"" feel to otherwise cute dresses. I was able to dress it down a little with some simple wedges. The wedding was not formal so I felt a tiny bit over dressed... but I felt cute and was so comfortable in it that I didn't care.","June 26, 2017","Wedding"

I was able to wear a normal, supportive bra. It was cold so I did wear a black cardigan. I got tons of compliments and felt good about the dress. I'm a pear shape and rented a 22 and a 20. The 22 puckered at the armpits so I was glad I got the backup size. I am really glad I rented this dress....So much better than anything I'd have bought. The poofy skirt helped disguise my giant bottom. Cons: I still rated this dress high, but here are the cons. I'm not tall at all. Usually dresses in my size (20-22) are too long so when I saw people comment that this dress was short, I thought it would be perfect. It was in fact TOO short for me. I have bad legs and would have liked the dress to be 2-3 inches longer. I felt a bit self conscious about my exposed pudgey knees, so I did not dance at this wedding. Both dresses had some snags in the skirt which didn't bother me really. The zipper was difficult to get past the seam at the waist. My husband had a hard time with it but I have narrow shoulders so I just zipped it past that and put it over my head.","March 27, 2017","Wedding"

The extra padding and lift was needed to fill out the top. I still had a little gap, but that was only noticeable from certain angles. The V in the front is pretty high, so pushing up the girls still won't give you a lot of visible cleavage. The waist fit perfectly and the dress was great for the warmer weather (80s). The material is solid and not light and flimsy, but I still stayed cool.","July 31, 2018","True to Size"

The jacquard fabric dresses it up and the pockets are amazing! I am 5'2"" and about 130 pounds and the 6 fit like a glove. Shows enough cleavage but not too much so it's perfect for any type of event. The color is like an orange-red and seemed to complement my skin (very fair). Hem hit right above the knee so it was a perfect length for a classy event. If your looking for a mini, you either need to be super tall or find another dress.

I got a spray tan, so I was a bit darker than my normal pasty-white. That was a good thing for this dress, as my skin has pink undertones and did not look great pre-spray tan. I'm a size 10-12 in most tops and bottoms, sometimes in 14 in dresses with no stretch, 38C. I wore the 10 in this dress and it was snug, but not too tight. There is a good amount of stretch to this thing. It. Is. Short. I'm 5'3"" and if I was any taller I would have felt uncomfortable in his dress.

The fit was great (even the sleeves) and the open back looked really pretty. The only downside is you cant wear a traditional bra, but I felt like the cups in the front gave enough coverage/support for me so I was fine. I'm on the shorter side and the skirt was a little long, so I wore small heels and I felt like it hit a midi-length, which I liked.

This dress is very forgiving and flowing past the waist so my 28 jeans size was no issue. At 34AA I didn't need a bra but it's very structured for those that might. There is a layer of netting that I found to be itchy especially around my neck and chest. It wasn't horrible but I didn't forget it was there. The skirt has about four layers so it's good for colder weather. I loved that the back was out. It made me still feel a little sexy but I was completely comfortable at the late evening December wedding.","December 30, 2018","Wedding"

The lace looks so delicate and pretty but the dress was in great shape. I loved the back and I'm bummed I didn't get a good picture of it from the back. I also loved the pockets! They are actually quite big and I was able to fit my stuff in them without causing weird bulges thanks to the full skirt. I had a lipstick and card in one pocket and my phone in the other, and I ended up decided not to carry a bag.

I had to spin it around and zipper it myself and then turn it around again. I loved the length of the dress and the three quarter lace sleeves. It was a very cold January night and the dress was perfect. I loved the classic lines of the dress and the sexy open back. I did not have to wear a bra and the girls held up very well.

The material is great, the skirt is a bit long on me since I'm a bit short, just past the knee, and the color is more a purple-ish blue in the daylight, but still very pretty. The chest had enough support that my 36C self did not need anything underneath the dress which was great because of the keyhole back. The skirt is a bit fuller than I expected, it poofs a bit more right at the hip than I first thought, but it was really beautiful nonetheless. I received lots of compliments and while there isn't a ton of give in the material, it was still super comfortable to sit and dance around in without any worries. I LOVED it.

I'm very much pear shaped, 12 on top and 14 on the bottom so the fit and flare is my go to and this was great for that even tho I felt a little like a sausage around the band.

So I was worried about my strapless bra showing but all I had to do was pull it down a bit in the back and it was fine. There's no stretch to the fabric but it wasn't too tight.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CLO4","Katie","Awesome dress for a masquerade party","I rented this dress for a Carnevale masquerade party. The pattern matched my mask style & color, so at first I was worried that the dress might not fit well because those were my only parameters for deciding to rent it. Luckily I ended up really loving the dress's fit too. It's definitely very thick and ""wetsuit"" like, so I would not recommend wearing it if you are going to be outside or in a humid/hot climate, as the dress is not breathable. However, my party was in February in the northeast, so it was quite cold. Despite the dress's material, I was able to dance and moved around very easily. If you are particularly curvy, be warned that the dress will not hide it well, but if like me, you like showing off what few curves you do have because it is still fairly stretch and uber-secure (I'm more of an hourglass, but a smaller size), this dress is awesome for showcasing a feminine form.","April 20, 2015","True to Size"

While I liked this dress, I was moving around a lot through the night and never really felt comfortable. I constantly felt like I had to adjust it. It might work better on a more tall and thin figure. Overall, a solid rental.

I was able to wear a strapless bra which was necessary since the fabric isn't thick and structured enough to go without one. Being 5'2"" I sometimes have trouble with the length of dresses, but this one ended up being perfect with heels on. Both the 2 and 4 fit, but I ended up wearing the 4 because I had a bit of extra room (I didn't want it too tight considering the nature of the gala I was attending).

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it bunched up a little bit on the backside funny if it wasn't pulled up in the front correctly which wasn't very often. I noticed it more when I sat down and it shifted a little and bunched when I got up. It may have been better with the size 2 with this, but I felt like the size 2 restricted my legs too much as it was a little bit of a mermaid style on the bottom which I wasn't expecting. Still loved it though and got lots of compliments on it! I also loved the lace detail and felt like i didn't need a necklace with it.

I had on 3"" heels with the gown. The unfortunate part of the gown was that the mesh lace top was torn in the front and back. That made the whole rental experience upsetting. First the gown I wanted to wear was delayed and not going to arrive on time, then the gown that does arrive has holes.

Given that all the ladies would be wearing a long black dress, I wanted something that would be within the requested attire but with a little flare. This dress fit the requirements but had a little detail of see-through lace that made me stand out (in an elegant way). The lace was just the right amount of ""pop"" that I wanted so I wore with simple pearls and strappy black heels. I didn't even wear much make up! I usually wear a size 4 but tend to go with 6 for most dresses (I prefer a bit more room for comfort). I am on the shorter side (5 ft 2'"") and always have issues with length. I wore this with 2 1/2 inch heals and the dress grazed the floor but was never an issue to walk or go up/down stairs. The material was super super comfortable, even after all the hors d'oeuvres and dinner. I was so excited to hear all the compliments on how elegant I looked (especially given all the high-level officials that were in the crowd!)

I went with the 4 and used stick on petals (no bra) so you wouldn't see the bra line. It was a black tie wedding and the dress was very appropriate, classy and comfortable.

The 8 fit well but the neckline was stretched out (or maybe it was supposed to fit that way?) and was slightly saggy in the front and droopy in the back.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DM26","Stephanie","Beautiful color!","This was my backup dress. I loved it. I did have to go a size bigger than I normally wear, because my arms aren't ""skinny"" and the lace sleeves wouldn't work on my normal size. This made the dress a little bigger in the chest and the fabric that wraps around the shoulders, but no one could really tell but me. I loved the gold details in the dress and the blue was perfect! The length was great! I'm not normally able to find knee length dresses to fit me because I'm a bit on the tall side, but this dress did the trick. The only complaint I have is that the fabric is starting to look rather worn. I assume just because of how many times it's been worn at this point, which is going to happen. I'm not sure how long they keep dresses in circulation before retiring them. Even with the dress showing some wear, I was still very happy with it.","October 18, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DM26","RTR Customer","Classic Elegance","After reading other reviews, I was prepared to size up from my usual size 4 to a size 6, with a size 8 as a backup. Since both 4 and 6 were unavailable, I took a risk and ordered a size 8, and was glad I did. I think the 6 would have been fine, but the arms would have been snug, as other reviewers have mentioned. The 6 would have fit better in the bust and shoulder area, because when I lifted my arms, I could see a little bit of extra fabric, and the the neckline extended all the way to the edge of my shoulders. I liked this looser fit, but, it's worth noting that someone my size with a larger bust could fit in the size 8 even better. The right arm had a little hole in it, but I just turned it toward the inside and it really wasn't noticeable. I also noticed a snag on the back, but with the dark fabric, again, it really wasn't noticeable when pressed down onto the dress. I appreciated the camouflaging effect of the side-ruching fabric and the way the gold thread dressed it up, making it perfect for an evening event.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DM26","Lauren","Gorgeous dress that is made for curves!","This dress is gorgeous. The color is so sophisticated (navy with gold fabric running through in a very tasteful way) and perfect for a wedding. The fabric around the body is stretchy, the fabric around the arms is less forgiving but still has some slack to it. I could have worn a 10 if I wanted it to be more close to the body to really hug my curves but this ended up being perfect and comfortable. The zipper is on the side and is hidden, so be careful when pulling down and up as the fabric tends to get a bit stuck. I am 5'5"" and the dress went down to my knees exactly. The rouching on the waist gives more of the illusion of curves. The boat neckline is a little annoying for those with larger breasts (I am a 38DD). I do not wear strapless bra so I opted for my regular strapped bra and used tiny pins to keep the strap to the dress near the edges of my shoulders.","August 25, 2016","True to Size"

The attached is the best picture of my arms, I would not share the other ones because they are unflattering. I ordered this dress with a 2-day notice so I had to pick from what was available, otherwise I would not have gone for laced sleeves (but they look wonderful on ladies with skinny arms). Also I forgot that this dress would require a special bra because of the open shoulders and had to just push the straps of a regular bra off my shoulders, which might be noticeable in this picture. This dress requires appropriate undergarments to cover imperfections because it is rather thin. Overall, if baring your shoulders is not a problem and you are not concerned about the size of your arms, it is a nice dress.","November 12, 2015","Formal Affair"

The 16 was just on the edge of being too tight because the waist line (where the black top meets the start of the skirt) has no stretch, despite the rest of the top being very stretchy (and slightly loose around the bust area) and comfortable. I ended up wearing shapewear underneath, but I think that was just because I'm somewhat between sizes right now. I really love the color of the skirt and besides the tightness in the waist it was very comfortable and easy to dance in. The pockets were awesome, I didn't have to bring a clutch or anything! I also rented the necklace seen in the pictures and the ensemble was a hit! I got lots of compliments and had a great night. Hoping I can rent this again in a smaller size down the line!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CN88","Stephanie","Pretty colors, strange fit","I loved the blues and greens in this dress's skirt, bold and beautiful. However, the dress fit was weird on me. As other reviewers have noted, the top can be large on small chested women (I am a 34 B cup). I'm usually a size 4-6, and knowing that the top ran big, I sized down to the 4. However, the 4 just fit because where the waist comes in (before puffing out to the full skirt) has absolutely no stretch. This also makes it difficult to zip up if you are a single lady living alone like me. And even though I sized down, the upper part was still too big around the arms and had extra fabric length wise as well. The skirt is exceptionally full, so I have included a second pic with a side view to show that. I am 3 months post abdominal surgery, so this was actually something I wanted in a dress, but I could see it being a surprise to see people just how full the skirt is. All-in-all I liked the dress, but it isn't one that I loved or even one that I am sure I'd rent again. It can be worn with a normal bra, and even has bra snaps to hold your straps in place, which was nice.","June 28, 2017","True to Size"

Pockets were extremely helpful since I couldn't have my purse on me for this event. You can't really tell from the picture, but the 4 was big on me; I wish I had gone down a size instead of up & gotten a 2 for a tighter top.

The pockets are great for holding you phone and lipstick when you need to get on the dance floor.

It's flattering to have a fitted, black top with a more generous skirt that his nice wide pleats that lay flat.

I easily could've worn a 4 in this style. This dress is great for any cup size, especially larger busts. There is comfortable room and the fabric at the bust is stretchy. Standard bra can be worn with this dress. The style is fitted at the natural waist. The fuller skirt allows for comfortable room for full hips. At 5'8"", the dress hit at my knees.

The arms were very restrictive, which I didn't think would be a problem since I wasn't dancing, but it did make putting my shoes on and getting ready very difficult. The dress was also quite short and rode up throughout the night. I felt like I was constantly trying to shimmy it down but it continually creeped up, particularly when I was seated at dinner. If you wear any type of shapewear, it might show while seated. I did use the larger, back-up size which was more comfortable in the arms and hips, but I would not rent again.","June 4, 2019","Small"

I agree with what the others have said about the arms, they are tight, like I needed my boyfriend's help zipping me up, and forget about trying to fix your makeup or hair after its on tight. Other than the tight arms, I had no problems with the dress. It doesn't stretch so choose your actual size, don't try to go down a size. And unless you are 6' tall don't expect it to be as short as the model wearing it in the photo. I am 5'7 and the dress was about 2"" above my knee. I wouldn't have wanted it any shorter though, as sitting down it tends to ride up quite a bit.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH81","Maggie","Pretty, but runs large","I wish this dress had fit better, because it's beautiful in person. I rented the 0, and it fit more like a 4. I'm a D in the chest, and the fit in both chest and waist was more like a sheath, which was disappointing because I felt shapeless. Also, when you sit, the dress runs up and exposes about 2"" of the liner every time. Otherwise, the color and detail of the dress are very pretty, and the dress is high quality.","October 1, 2017","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH81","Jill","I wore this dress to a wedding in mid September.","I loved this dress! The lace was beautiful and I loved the half sleeves. The photo was taken at sunset, so the purple colors look darker than it actually is. The coloring is definitely more similar to the color in the dress image icon. Maybe even a bit brighter. This was a perfect dress for an outdoor wedding. I got a little overheated during the day when the sun was hot, but it was perfect during the night. I usually wear a 2, but went with a 4 on this one based on other's advice. I can totally see how the sleeves could be restraining. The chest was a bit too big on me, but wasn't super noticeable. I would definitely wear this dress again!","September 19, 2017","True to Size"

Like other reviews, it is a little tight in the arms but besides not being able to lift my arms all the way up it didn't have any impact. The lace has a slight amount of wear but was not visible to others. It ran very true to size, was slightly shorter than I anticipated ending at mid thigh but overall a great choice.","August 24, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AX37","Emily","Muted standout color","The color of this dress really is pretty and the lace details are feminine. I love this designer however my body fits between a small and medium so the fit is not the best for me. I only got one size because of my subscription so I kind of wish I would have squeezed into a small given that my shape falls flat when it doesn't hug my body, which this size medium did not. It still looks nice and the cold shoulder gives an extra bit of flare but those are just flaps that hang over your shoulder you don't actually put your arm through them at least I didn't cause I couldn't figure it out haha. The fit is my minus a star so that is all relative to your body shape. People that said size up it has no give --- I mean I sized up and I have too much give you know what I mean? Difficult being in between sizes so I suppose going with the bigger size and not having it as flattering is better than being uncomfortable? I don't know it depends as again this dress still looks good. Husband loved it.","January 31, 2019","Date"

I wore the Medium because the Large was unavailable and it justtt fit. The ""sleeves"" made me feel like I had some coverage but I didn't get too hot dancing. Like other people mentioned it doesn't have any stretch, and when I sat down the black line of lace on the bottom seemed a little high/tight, but wasn't a big deal. Would recommend sizing up if you have a larger chest and want to wear a bra. It felt supportive enough without one since the fabric is thick but at times I definitely felt the Large would have fit my upper body better.","January 22, 2019","Wedding"

Also, I didn't have any problems with the top being too roomy. Dress was in good condition. The fabric was pretty heavy but I liked it...perfect for a crisp, October evening wedding.

I really love dresses that are tight on top & flow out, as I have sizable hips, and this fit the bill. Only flaw: the material is amazing but heavy, so I got quite sweaty when dancing. Also, be sure to size down on this one. I at first received a bigger size & the Rent the Runway Customer Service rep was fantastic and helped me snag a smaller size in time for my event.

I am Usually a 2 or 2 petite, 32d bust, 5'4"" height. The bust underlayer is cut quite low, though but the lace overlay keeps it from being scandalous!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NL66","Angie","Cute and versatile style","I had brunch, went to see a matinee, had a fancy dinner and then a welcome reception for a wedding, so I wore this for 14+ hours. I found it very comfortable, and totally appropriate for all of the things I did. It's easy to dress down a little with a cardigan or up with some fancier earrings and lipstick. My current size situation seems to be that I can get into a 12, but I don't feel pretty or confident in it, so I got this in a 14 and it fit comfortably. It loosened up a bit as the day went on, and I think that resulted in the neckline sagging a little bit by the end of the night, but no one was noticing by that point. I'm giving it 4 stars because dresses like this are just hard to up-keep, and I noticed a few snags/tears in the top layer of material. Owning several dresses like this, I know how easy it is for that to happen, but that means you literally have to expect a slightly damaged dress to show up. The good news is the dark color keeps it from being noticeable!","June 3, 2018","True to Size"

I normally am an 8 and I wore the 8 that was sent, and it fit comfortably. The built in bra support was nice so I wasn't worried about the girls all night. However, the material around the metal support in the bra had worn off, so the metal was sticking through the material and stabbed me all night.

It was pretty and comfortable. However it was hard to zip and unzip. I needed help for both. I don't think I could have unzipped it myself.Do not try it on without someone there to help you get out of it!! It also wasn't a perfect fit. The 6 was a bit tight on top and the 8 was a bit too big. The waist fit well on both and I loved the pockets. It is a little low cut, but was fine for my smaller chest","January 14, 2018","True to Size"

I ended up going with the 2, and it fit comfortably. The zipper stuck a bit the first time I tried it on, but after that it was fine. The material is heavy, which made it fabulous for a work Christmas party, and the cut was flattering. I loved the pockets and had a great place to stash my cell phone all night, and the dress is sturdy enough to not lose shape if you use the pockets! The cut was sexy but not inappropriate. I felt pretty and confident all night!","December 19, 2017","True to Size"

The cut would be flattering on just about anyone. The fabric is thick and I was able to eat dinner without feeling like I had to suck in my gut. This was my first RTR and I am hooked! I ended up wearing my backup size 2 instead of the 4. The stylist notes said to size down for your backup if you are small busted and I think that's accurate.","December 8, 2017","Party"

I ended up with the 18W. I was a little disappointed that the back up 16 didn't come along (although the back up dress they sent along in 2 sizes was beautiful) because this size ended up being larger on me than anticipated.

In a panic I called, they had this overnighted for my Saturday 1pm wedding! The stylist that recommended it NAILED it. Incredibly comfortable and flattering.

I decided to go ahead and order both sizes 4 & 6 for this dress and I am glad I did! The 4 barely zipped up half way before I decided it was just too small. The 6 fit well, despite the fact that my husband had a hard time zipping it past the belt, it got stuck there and needed a little force. The dress did seem to feel tighter after I ate dinner but I wasn't too terribly uncomfortable. I LOVED the pockets, especially since they were practically undetectable when you look at the dress. Overall a great dress! I felt beautiful!","December 5, 2016","Small"

It was just enough sparkle and pizzaz for a wedding that started at 4pm. It wasn't too night time and wasn't too day time. The thick fabric was perfect for fall in Upstate New York. My only complaint was getting into this is a 2 person job. The thick material and cinched waist complicates things a bit. The waist is also very much cut in and a bit tight but it got looser as the night went on. I'm a sucker for a dress with pockets so I really loved everything about it. Another great rent the runway success!","November 10, 2016","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL98","Elspeth","Great style, loved the fabric and cut","I wore this dress for a wedding rehearsal dinner and it was a perfect style for the semi-formal event. The skirt was a lovely shimmery black fabric that really stood out in an understated way. It flared out nicely and had pockets! The top was a pretty lace that paired nicely with the skirt. I would say that it runs a little big (my street size is a 16, but designer dress size is 18/20 thanks to a 45inch bust). I ordered a size up because my previous ML dress in an 18 was super tight around the waist, but this one was too big. I think the 18 would have fit me perfectly in this design. Thanks to the structured nature of the dress I was still able to wear it without issue, but I would have preferred a smaller size or a way to cinch it more at the waist.","August 24, 2016","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TT85","Melissa","Weird fit - poofs out","The dress itself would be fine if it weren't for the waist area. It poofs out and makes you look larger than you are. I didn't like the fit at all and almost didn't wear it. I decided to because the color and print designs are nice and I didn't have time to swap it out before my vacation. Would probably look fine on women with no curves.","June 6, 2019","Vacation"

I wore this for a med school white coat ceremony. Fit perfectly snug above the waist. Nice and loose in the skirt. The quality of the fabric is great, and was cool enough on a hot day.

The dress was slightly big for me, so I could have possibly gone with a size smaller, but it wasn't noticeable to anyone else. Also, it was a super humid day and there's a layer under the dress that made it a lot warmer on my legs than I thought.

I received so many compliments on this number. I am normally a size 12 and ordered the 12 with 10 as a backup. I would say it runs pretty true-to-size, though someone with a smaller bust might get away with the smaller of the two. one word of advice, get a low profile strapless bra. The top cuts in a bit around the chest/shoulders and a regular bra will definitely show.","June 7, 2017","True to Size"

The zipper was a little stiff and I needed help. If you want to hide the tummy and hips., this is the perfect dress. However, I felt that cut of the dress and fullness of the skirt made me appear heavier than I was. Also, the straps around the neck felt a little tight but not enough to be bothersome. The sequins rubbed a little bit. I loved the deep pockets and the length of the dress was perfect. The dress was dressy but not overly so. It’s perfect for a cocktail party. You don’t need a necklace. You can wear a strapless bra for support. However, the material is thick enough that you don’t have to.","March 23, 2019","True to Size"

Got lots of compliments and I loved that it had pockets! I am between a 2 and 4 normally and the 2 fit great - I would have been curious to see how a 0 fit though because I still had a little room in the waist.","May 31, 2018","Large"

I also loved that the top was form fitting and flattering while the skirt--which hit lower than an empire waist but higher than a natural waist--allowed for plenty of breathing room.

I find that for most RTR dresses, if they aren't stretchy, they will be too tight because I have a wide chest. All in all just not flattering.","October 13, 2016","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RAO20","Rachel","Beautiful dress for a formal wedding","The first thing that I have to point out is that I rented this dress in 2 sizes and on both dresses it was next to impossible to zip up past where the material changes from the skirt to the top half, and the zipper on the size 6 was damaged when it arrived. The dresses both fit well and while I am generally an 8, I would've worn the 6 had the zipper been working. It is kind of hard to tell from the photos, but the top half has shiny black sequins in a cross cross pattern. Overall this dress worked perfectly for the occasion.","July 30, 2016","Wedding"

I'm usually a four or six in dresses and went with the six in this one. It had nice big pockets. I am smaller on the top and more pear shaped so the cut of this worked perfectly. The only downside was that the sequins were a little scratchy when my arms were by my sides but that didn't end up bothering me much. I'd definitely rent it again!","July 19, 2016","Party"

It is very flattering and comfortable for a night of dancing, and pockets are always a great touch! I got a ton of compliments on the dress and was sad to return it.

I'm typically a size 4 and I do think the 4 would have fit better (it was a tad tight in the chest and I couldn't zip it to the tip top which was fine), but it still worked out perfect.

I ordered the 10 with a backup of 8 and the 8 fit like a glove. I was really impressed with the condition and quality of this dress. I was ready for some missing sequins or loose seams since that easily happens to beaded or sequined dresses with wear, but I couldn't find even one! It was in perfect condition, like I just bought it brand new. I'm 5'5 and wore 4-inch heels and the dress came a couple inches above my knee which I thought was a nice length. The skirt did need to be pressed/steamed so leave a little time to do that. Overall I LOVED IT and wish I could keep it!

I wore this to work with a cardigan over it (buttoned all the way up... because this dress is lowwww cut, people!). Very easy transition from day to night. The dress looks darker in real life than it does in RTR's pictures. It almost looked black with a red iridescence. But that was nice for me as I'm not really a fan of wearing red.

I went with the 10 instead of the 12 because I have a short torso and the shoulders fit better with the smaller size. The fabric was nicely structured without being stiff, and the shine was perfectly understated. I paired a belt with it to break up the dress, and be prepared to have the girls on display. I'm usually not comfortable with that, but the dress is so classy, I didn't feel bad about it! Would totally own this dress!","November 30, 2015","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AL12","Angelyn","Amazing dress for a Fall Wedding in New England.","First of all, I got compliments on this dress all night. The color, the material, and the fit were all amazing. I was a little nervous it would be too low cut, but it was perfect for a tactful, slightly sexy dress for a wedding with family and friends. I am a 36DD and the size 12 fit a little bit big at the top. The straps just have to be frequently adjusted. I liked the fit of the 10 a little bit better but the zipper didn't quite zip all the way up (my sister informed me that that means that it did not fit and I didn't like the fit of it better, but I just wish I could have had a size in-between the 10 and the 12). If I owned the dress I would take in the top a little bit, however all-in-all I LOVED the fit and the dress. The material was a little bit thicker so it felt warm but not too hot on a chilly November night in New England. I would definitely recommend renting this dress and wish I could buy it from RTR because that is how much I liked it.","November 15, 2015","True to Size"

It was perfect in the bust and I was able to wear a regular bra with it, but I do wish that it could've been more form fitting in the waist to show off my figure. I got so many compliments on the dress and loved that it was such a unique color and style. I had a great experience and will definitely rent again!","October 30, 2015","Other"

It was very low cut, often showing much more than I wanted to show up top! I thought the dress was very pretty and flattering. However, I was disappointed in the dress's color- the metallic didn't show through with the lighting in the room, so it basically looked black. I would recommend wearing this dress to a daytime, outdoor occasion to show off its color. Will rent a different dress next time!","October 20, 2015","Wedding"

My only problem isn't really a dress problem, I'm not very busty so I had to wear a push up with extra inserts( pretty much two bras) in order to fill the dress out properly.

LOVED it!","This was my first choice dress but I was more confident about the size so I ordered it as my backup. Good thing, because neither size of the other dress worked. I normally wear size 2, often size 0 in brands like WHBM, Ann Taylor, etc. But designer dresses often run smaller, and from reviews I was confident the 4 would fit and it was perfect. I don't have a full body photo, but the dress fit exactly as shown on the model. The dress will show off your shoulders much like a halter but with more coverage and support. Only posted the 2nd photo to show the back cutout a little. I was able to wear a strapless bra and have the band hidden just beneath the cutout. I would buy this dress if I could! I loved it so much I wore it to church the next morning with black tights and a black shrug to make it more conservative and weather-appropriate.","December 13, 2017","Small"

My husband said the 8 looked better but when ya just don't feel it...AND he wasn't going with me to this event ... wink wink. This dress held the chest in which helped hold my tape laced bra inserts(chicken cutlets) in place all night. No need for a bra, the material is nice a heavy(but not in a hot and thick way).

I wore it to a wedding where the dress code wasn't very clear, and it worked perfectly. The fabric definitely has a shimmer to it, so it could easily be dressed up to ""cocktail"" level with sparkly jewelry, but it also fit in perfectly at the more casual evening oceanside wedding I attended. My normal size 4 was unavailable, so I rented a 2 and a 6 - the 2 fit, but just barely! I am an hourglass shape, heavier on the bottom with a very small waist, so I loved that this dress hugged my top and waist and flared out to hide my lower half. The arm holes were a little small and the top was a tiny bit tight, but I was still able to dance and move comfortably. If you're bigger on top or straight up and down, I would probably recommend sizing up for your backup. I loved this and would definitely rent it again!","May 20, 2017","Wedding"

Furthermore, if you're going to be doing a lot of sitting, I wouldn't recommend this because it puffs up in the front and looks silly.

There were all ages at this party--70+ year olds to current college students and I felt as though my dress was appropriately fun yet respectful and age-appropriate for me. I wore a NuBra with it but could have probably gone bra-less. I also loved that I didn't have to wear special underwear or Spanx. I paired the dress with nude strappy heels and black earrings. Based on the reviews, I ordered the size 6 and 8, thinking that the 8 might be better (because many said that it ran small) but the 6 was better and I would've even liked to have tried a 4, just in case. Overall though, it was perfect. The service of RTR continues to impress me--I've never had so much as a ""hiccup"" in my orders and I recommend it to everyone who'll listen.","April 26, 2017","True to Size"

I have a slightly broad back for my size, but the 6 still zipped up with a little help. Some reviews say the sleeves were restricting with dancing, I didn't find that to be the case. Only thing was I guess the 6 just barely fit, because after the meal + dessert, it was uncomfortably tight in the midsection. Got great compliments and it's obviously a really nice material for the skirt.","August 5, 2018","True to Size"

It’s tight on the shoulders and bust, but I would rather it be tight than loose and have the straps slip. IT ALSO HAS POCKETS which was so convenient! The blue skirt is a nice wintery shade and I fit in perfectly at this winter wedding. The shape of the dress creates an incredibly flattering figure and it was comfortable enough to wear—and dance in—all day. I especially love the neckline and had no problem finding a bra that works with the dress. Would highly recommend!","November 9, 2017","True to Size"

I did not have any issues with the straps being too tight--definitely a bit restrictive but I wasn't at an event that required me to do more than walk around. I could have gone without a bra but chose to wear a strapless. The pockets were great--nice and big, though I mostly kept my hands in them rather than any items like my phone. Got a lot of compliments and I thought the style was really suited to me while still also being something different for me. My only complaint isn't regarding the dress, but the backup size and order fulfillment. I ordered a 6 and an 8, but the 8 was not in my shipment; instead, I received a pair of leather pants I definitely did not order! Luckily the 6 was perfect, but if it hadn't been, I would have been at a loss. This won't prevent me from renting again, but clearly mistakes can happen.","November 7, 2017","True to Size"

I usually fall between two sizes, but this dress was a bit tight in the midsection and both sizes I ordered were a little constricting were the black meets the blue (no stretch or give at all).

I got so many compliments on it, and it was soooooo comfortable. PLUS IT HAS POCKETS. I was nervous because I had never tried that off the shoulder look, but it was rather flattering. The inner material was so soft and satiny, I felt like I was wearing a nightgown that happened to serve up some serious fashion in its spare time. Have I mentioned the pockets? Every dress should have pockets. It runs slightly small, so get a size up as an option. I didn't need a bra, which was miraculous because my breasts are in the droopy department, but the dress managed to make it work. I know it's not structurally possible but I'm going to credit the pockets for that particular design achievement. I highly recommend this dress and the pockets it was built around.","October 21, 2017","Small"

I typically wear a 6 and my backup size was an 8 because other review said the waist band didn't have any give. This is true, the waist band DID NOT have any give, but the 8 was too loose up top. So I opted for the 6. The skirt color was the perfect amount of bold, in an understated (not flashy) way. The sleeves can be pulled up if you need more arm movement, but I really liked the look of the full off-the-shoulder sleeve. Also, POCKETS!","October 18, 2017","True to Size"

I'm glad I did as the dress fit perfect from the waist down, but the top was a little large. I had to pin it so it wasn't too open. Also, you should be aware the bottom draping is not sewn together or attached at all, so the slit goes all the way up. The fabric does overlap, but since it's in the front, I did pin it shut because I wore it to Mass and felt more comfortable knowing it was held in place when I sat down.

I am tall and it still came to my knees even over my belly. I knocked on star off because the slip underneath wasn't even close to being long enough- I was planning on wearing maternity spanx anyways but it felt weird and kept riding up as we walked around at the cocktail our and after dinner. The good news is the dress isn't see through so no one else could see the slip was hitting halfway down my butt. This isn't designed to be a maternity dress so I'm not surprised I had the issue, but something to consider if you're renting and pregnant.","August 25, 2019","Wedding"

However it did not close over my stomach (I have a bit of a tummy not a toned ab/stomach area). I wore an undershirt because it just didn't fit perfectly and kept riding up into a crop top instead of a shirt. The worst part were the sleeves. I thought I had normal sleeves but clearly you need to have dainty fairy arms and wrists to fit them into the shirt or you have to unbutton the three buttons on the sleeve which is such a hassle.

The top is so thin and scant it's like you're barely wearing anything - which I guess is all the fun of it. However , you're practically being pulled out of the top by the weight of the skirt which you'll notice the moment you pull it from your rental bag. The flimsy straps and waist tie do very little to bind the dress , there's a constant feeling that you're about to fall out","March 27, 2020","Date"

There is so much fabric around the bottom that in order to pull it tight, you have to fasten the front ties a ton. Unfortunately by tightening the front ties, you shrink the bottom of the ""triangle"" that in theory is supposed to cover your boobs. You can also pull the back tighter and shorten the straps, but this dress is so massive that even full tightened it barely covers anything. Super disappointing if you're trying to wear this anywhere except your bedroom.","April 8, 2020","Large"

I was unable to wear the dress bc it was too tight at that area. the plunge in the neckline is very deep so make sure that you have a cami to put on with this dress.","March 21, 2020","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ADM19","Shannon","So many people complimented the color and texture of this dress.","It shows a little more cleavage than I bargained for, but I WANT THIS DRESS.","March 9, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DL302","Sarah","Really wanted to love this","The zipper was stuck, so I literally couldn't even put it on. Looks like it would have been super cute though. One item of note, this piece could potentially be challenging for curvy girls (like me)- because my hips/rear fill out the pants, there was a slight pull across the tummy... I think I would have been slightly self conscious in this had I had the opportunity to wear it.","April 19, 2020","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DL302","Noreen","Sorry.....2 stars only.","But, don't just go bye me, give it a try. It is cute but I was disappointed that it was way to small for me. I have rented other Derek Lam 10 Crosby and those items fit true to size. Go figure?","April 25, 2020","Small"
