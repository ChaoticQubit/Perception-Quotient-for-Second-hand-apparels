I am 5'11 and it was a little short but I wore tights so I could get away with it. I am a 38 triple D and it fit nicely in the breast area. The material is stretchy and definitely fit me pretty tight but that is what I was wanting!","April 12, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Courtney","So comfy and beautiful!","Love love loved this dress. SO comfortable while also flattering and flirty.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Samantha","Felt elegant and sexy","I liked the fit of the med and large. I sized up due to shortness of dress. Only problem was the top. Not something double sided tape couldn't fix. Overall loved this dress.","March 15, 2020","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Gianna","DEEPLY obsessed","I am DEEPLY obsessed with this dress! Being a bigger gal with a larger chest...I was nervous about the cut of the dress. I went with the medium and it made the girls look great! Granted I did have to periodically adjust the top. I usually wear an 8-10 in jeans and usually an 8 in dresses and the medium fit me snug but well. I love how flattering the cut and color of this dress is. I felt so gorgeous in this dress! Highly recommend!","March 3, 2020","Date"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Jessica","LOVE!","This dress was perfect for the wedding rehearsal dinner I wore it to. It is fitted, but very comfy and soft. It has the perfect amount of stretch and the velvet makes it very forgiving. I got so many compliments that I'm tempted to buy it! It's the perfect length for shorter women like me, but tights underneath would make it more comfortable for taller women I'm sure. Sleeves were also perfect length. Love love love!","February 15, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Allison","Unique Yet Comfortable Party Dress","Absolutely loved this dress for our Friendsgiving party!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Maggie","Great fit, comfortable and looks amazing.","I wore this for a holiday party and it was perfect! I usually wear a S but went with the XS because I have a small busy. The dress has great stretch, is easy to put on and has a great flattering fit. I don't think the pictures do it justice!","February 7, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Malory","Birthday Glam","Fit perfectly! Classy/fun winter party dress...the long sleeves balance the deep V & shorter length! I was able to wear a regular bra. Very comfortable to wear/dance!","February 4, 2020","Party"

The material was stretchy, super comfortable and wasn't too tight anywhere. The simple rouching was very flattering and I easily danced all night long. Possibly one of my favorite rentals for sure.","January 28, 2020","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Kristy","So many compliments!","I wore this to an event that was cocktail attire. It was very comfortable. The small was very tiny, but the medium was perfect. You can wear a regular bra which is great! Easy to move it! The front does slit open so you have to be careful with that! Got the most compliments! It is low cut but I used fashion tape and felt comfortable.","January 21, 2020","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Alissa","I was immediately drawn to the color of this dress and it was just as gorgeous in person.","I rented this dress for my Anniversary dinner. I loved how it fit, but the neckline showed a lot of cleavage (34/36 C). All in all, I loved this dress and I got a lot of compliments on it! The dress way also very easy to return with the pre-paid return label!","January 19, 2020","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Rebecca","Show stopper","This dress was amazing for a winter wedding! The material is somewhat stretchy so I felt like I wasn't sucking it in all night! The only issue I had was the bust was a bit big so I used fashion tape but it didn't hold because of the fabric. The small fit well in the bust and I wouldn't have needed the fashion tape but my butt and legs were tight in the small.","January 17, 2020","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Anna","Unique and flattering","Sexy and different for a night out! The material has a subtle snakeskin pattern that brings a little shine.","January 13, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Erin","Beautiful dress","I was going to wear this dress but the style of the occasion changed, will probably choose for future! I am normally a L but ordered an XL so that it wasn't too bodycon and that was the right choice for me. It's a very flattering dress","January 10, 2020","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Jenaye","Flattering and Comfy","I rented this dress for NYE this year and was very pleased. My midsection is my trouble area and I felt like this dress covered it well, without making me look bigger than I am. Additionally, the dress is a really unique color. It's not just standard velvet. The velvet has almost like an alligator print overlay, which I thought made it a little more special. Bigger chested gals, be warned. You will be exposed, so if you're uncomfortable with that, a safety pin did the trick for me. Would recommend!","January 10, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","RTR Customer","Remarkable","Ordered a medium and large since I'm in between sizes. Tried on the large which fit great length-wise, wasn't so tight across the mid section, but the bust was just too big. Wore the medium and made due (kept pulling the front down as it would over time come up.","January 6, 2020","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Emily","Great NYE dress!","Super comfortable and flattering! Got lots of compliments on it. The color is beautiful and the length was just right. A bit too loose in the chest area so just be mindful","January 2, 2020","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Jennifer","Love this dress! Fit great and true to size.","The dress fit me very well. It wasn't too tight but snug in all the right places. I paired it with tights as it was especially cold that night. I wore this to my husband's company work holiday party.","December 30, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Meghan","Very figure flattering dress!","It definitely is a bit cleavagey for those with a larger bust, but if you are going to a party and want to show it off, this is the dress! It fit well around the waist, and was short. I personally love the ruffled sleeves, as it creates a more hourglass shape. If it is too short for you, you can pair easily with tights and heels. This would look very elegant for a more formal affair with your hair up, and long earrings with heels!","December 28, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Aimee","Showstopper velvet dress. Compliments all night long!","The XS fit very snug around my butt/hips, but fit perfectly in the chest area (B cup), so I went with the size Small to give me more room/comfort walking around and dancing at my work holiday party. I also paired it with black tights and booties to be more conservative with the short length. This is lower cut so prepare for cleavage, but it was tasteful on my chest size (larger busts might pop out, beware!). I felt beautiful in this dress and highly recommend! Order your regular size & 1 size up","December 24, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Jess","Ensconced in velvet","Beautiful color, stretchy soft fabric, V neckline. Very beautiful dress.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Jen","Velvet dream!","This dress was probably my favorite rental so far! The color and fabric were gorgeous! I also loved the fit, but be aware, the dress is quite short! I also had to use dress tape on the top just to make sure it fit me properly. However, I received so many compliments and I felt so confident in this dress. I would highly recommend this!","December 14, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Kelly","So beautiful!","My daughter wore this to a sweet 16. The velvet is thin so not stiff or hot. The draping looked beautiful on her!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Alexi","Not my favorite","This was not my favorite rental, but I still enjoyed wearing it. The neckline of the dress kept opening even wider to expose my bra, I am not well endowed in that area so this may not be an issue for others, but was for myself. I had to pay close attention to the wrap part of the dress as well, not to expose underwear with certain movements. Overall it was something different to wear being velvet and I still enjoyed it and received compliments throughout the night.","December 2, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Amber","The perfect birthday dress!","I wore this for my birthday and it looked sooo amazing! It's super short but super warm! I paired it with thigh high boots and didn't need a coat during the late fall in the Midwest.","November 30, 2019","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR97","Sarah","This dress was so comfortable to dance in!","The thicker material and long sleeves made it perfect for a fall/winter wedding.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN198","Emily","Fits like a glove","Wore this dress to the opera and loved every moment. It was comfortable and the straps covered my bra which was a huge plus. The ruffles are asymmetric which I didn't realize when I rented, but it made the dress less precious and more sophisticated.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN198","Courtney","Too tight in the bust","Besides being too tight in the busy, fit perfect. I didn't wear it because my boobs were so smashed (33"" chest measurement). Velvet material and sparkly silver were cute details.","March 2, 2020","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN198","Cindy","Fun!","I didn't actually wear this out because I ended up wearing a red dress I rented since it was Valentine's Day. Made me sad I didn't have any wear to wear this! The velvet flower overlay is very pretty. The asymmetrical skirt is fun. The v neck is very flattering. Going to keep this in mind to rent if I have another occasion for a fancy dress coming up.","February 15, 2020","Date"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN198","April","Pretty dress, just not for me.","This dress would be great for a winter event, but the fit was weird on me. It was loose in the bust, but the waist was tight. If you have a bigger bust and a smaller waist, this would probably work really well. I also have a very short waist, and it emphasized that.","January 21, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN198","Karen","Beautiful dress, runs large and you need a small waist","This dress looked beautiful on the model. I'm usually a size 4 but this dress gaped over the chest area and because of the band around the waist, made me look a lot bigger than I am. I'd probably have ordered a size 2 to see how that fits and I'm sure that size would've been more flattering.","November 25, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Lindsey","All season prettiness","I rented for a date but ended up wearing to work because the pussy now provided enough coverage on the chest. It's a bit tight in the chest and ribs but otherwise a great fit. Comfortable in february with tights and a jacket, but could totally be worn in warmer months as well as it's a floaty material. It flows beautifully when you walk as well.","February 21, 2020","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Ashlynn","Cute but small in the chest","This dress was so cute and trendy. The only problem I had was the bust. I'm a DD and this dress is for someone with a smaller chest. Also if you reach forward there was no give or stretch from the back, so it was tight. None the less I wore it all day and made it work. Very cute. True to size in the waist.","January 29, 2020","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Jennifer","Amazing Dress!","This dress was so gorgeous. I loved the wide, fluttering bell sleeves and the asymmetrical drape of the skirt. This might be one of those dresses that works better for tall girls.","December 17, 2019","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Jessica","Not my favorite...","I liked the style and pattern but the fit was terrible. It ran so small in the top getting it off and on was impossible. Definitely don't recommend if you are busty at all.","August 6, 2019","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Suzanne","Fun yellow pop","It runs a little small but still works.

If you have bigger arms like me I would try to size up and see if it's a better fit; it took some help from another person to pull the dress off. I received a ton of compliments. Perfect dress for a wedding if you're a dancer land like a little more movement in the bottom of the dress.","May 29, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Jennifer","Florals? For Spring? Groundbreaking!!!","Amazing dress, received so many compliments every time I wore it. Such a unique pattern and cut.

Very versatile piece.","April 23, 2019","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Ashley","Runs small, cool pattern","This fit me a little tight in the shoulders and arms, but it wasn't unmanageable. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with a wide chest - I'm a 32C and it fit well. Deep V that I covered strategically with the tie for work. Good day to night transition dress.","April 20, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Cozette","Flowy and Comfy","I like this dress, but it did not end up making it out of my (very messy) closet, as the photos show. It just came off a little too ""bumblebee"" on me. The color contrast was just too much. Ended up wearing a different RTR dress. It is very comfortable, flowy, nice lining, good length, fit true to size. I could definitely say it would be good for a long day or evening of wear.","April 1, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Jennifer","Unique Dress","This dress is very flattering and an attention grabber. The only part I did not love was the deep plunge with the high neck tie. I found the best look was tied to the side of the neck and just a half knot. It you tie a knot the fabric is too heavy and flops a bit.","March 8, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Emily","Comfortable, cheery dress!","Love this dress so much, think I'm going to keep it a while! Does run small in the chest but fits perfectly everywhere else. Super cool asymmetric cut at the bottom makes it move and drape beautifully.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Michelle","Beautiful dress, but decolletage not appropriate for most offices. Great for an evening out.","The body of the dress fit perfectly, buy I have an athletic build and it was a tiny bit tight across my back and biceps. I was going to wear it anyway because it didn't look tight or ill-fitting, it just felt that way to me. Then I realized that the decolletage was too much for work. I thought it was ok bc I am only a 32B, but my husband said that all of the men in the office would be distracted. He loved it of course! If your chest was any bigger, I think it would have been a lot of cleavage. The picture doesn't show it because it is under a scarf. I also thought that I could hide it for the day with the scarf, but I couldn't risk it so I ended up not wearing it. That's too bad because I thought it fit beautifully otherwise.","February 21, 2020","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG136","Kristin","Nothing - work day","The top is slightly gaping (if you have a flat chest), slightly too much for work.

It is flattering, distinctive, and people of all ages were complimenting me. The real downfall is the fit of the jumpsuit. It was pretty loose in the belly/hip region, but extremely tight around the rib cage - almost to the point that it felt like I was wearing a corset. It was uncomfortable to sit in and once I started eating brunch, it got to the point where I couldn't wait to take it off. I'd recommend sizing up for this one - maybe if I'd done that, I would've had no fit issues. Either way, I can't deny how gorgeous the jumpsuit is, which is why I still gave 4 stars.","August 26, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ELT53","Courtney","Loved the color and comfort but it kept moving out of place...","Rented as my backup option for a winter wedding. Loved the color and it was so comfortable to wear all night long. The fabric is a little thicker which made it perfect for the season but also gave it a nice shaping effect. The only downsides were that the dress was a little longer than I would have liked and I occasionally had to tug it back into position, especially around the shoulders and midsection. Overall I loved the dress and would rent again.","March 15, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ELT53","Ashley","Flattering and attention-grabbing","I loved this dress SO MUCH. The fit was just on the small side, but that just made it hug my curves all the more -- I got a larger size as a backup and the extra room didn't quite do the design justice. I had seen other reviewers mention that you can't lift your arms, but I found the neck/arms to be pretty versatile. You can place it low on your shoulders like in the picture, but if it sits a little higher it gives an equally attractive boatneck look that lets you move your arms all you want (which I did, because dancing). I got zillions of compliments, and you will too. My only concern: both this size and the backup size had a hole in the side seam; luckily the backup size was worse (it looked like it had been mended by hand with a hotel sewing kit; it was awful) and the size I wore didn't really show all that much. But since this was my first Rent the Runway purchase, that doesn't bode terribly well for my future business.","March 4, 2020","True to Size"

I will say I think the color looked a little bit born and you can tell the zippers been yanked on heavily. The zipper was so sticky my husband was really struggling to pull it up. So once it's on it's on! I still recommend it but just be wary to order up and know that the zipper is pretty difficult.","January 7, 2020","Wedding"

Spanks are difficult because of the waist line, but the fabric is thick and a thong is fine. My only complaint is its a little long for us short or athletically legged bodies. You'll have to wear those high heels, or at least use the slit aggressively when taking photos to give yourself some length.","December 18, 2019","True to Size"

I'm a bit bigger on the bust, so there was a little bit of side-boob action, but nothing to concern the elders about. Typically I'm a size 8, it was a little loose fitting around the mid section, and I had to keep pulling down the skirt whenever I would stand up or walk.

The fabric is nice and thick with very little stretch (would not recommend for expecting mamas). Biggest problem with the design of the dress is that zipper! Make sure you have someone with you to help muscle it over the middle where all the waist fabric meets up - it was a joint effort by myself and my husband. I wore this to an outdoor gala and the end of August (mid 70s temps) in upstate NY for St Jude's Children's Research Hospital.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FLL16","Egle","Not my favorite","I fell in love with this dress from the picture online but unfortunately it's not as great in person. The color is a bit darker not ice pink as it appears and looks a bit cheap. I'm an athletic body type with small waist. I usually wear XS but XS was too tight in the chest area. Size S was good in the chest but really big in the waist area so I had to improvise and make it work by wrapping the straps around the waist which made it look better. It does photograph nicely though especially in darker lighting.","August 27, 2019","Wedding"

I could have pulled off a 4 for waist, so suggest sizing up if you are on the bustier side. This dress was extremely flattering.

I had ZERO problems with shipping/returning, and the dress was even better in person than in the photos. Typically, I wear a size 16 and was hesitant to get this dress because it only went up to XL. It fit fine, although I couldn't use the zipper to get it on - I had to put it on over my head. I was honestly bummed to return this dress. I felt so good in it! Compliments all night.","February 10, 2020","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KM7","Theresa","Perfect black dress!","Got this for a Casino Royale NYE party and it was nearly perfect! The small worked perfectly for me, with a few adjustments. When I tried it on the plunging neckline went WAY too low--I was in danger of a serious wardrobe malfunction. The rest of it fit quite nicely including the length of the dress, so I put 6 safety pins up the front to close up the deep V to a reasonable depth. Worked like a charm! The outer layer draped so nicely. 10/10 would rent again. Got compliments all night.","January 4, 2020","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KM7","Mindy","Sophisticated and Flirty","The photos do not do this dress justice! It is a showstopper, but in a subtle classy way. It has a beautiful chiffon overlay that has polka dots that gives the dress texture. The dress is a bit high maintenance to fit bc there is a very low front and back. This means, no bra. I'm a 32 C/D and needed to pin the straps higher, use boob tape and stick on bra. But even though it took some time to fit to my body, once I did it was comfortable throughout the night and allowed me to exude confidence.","November 3, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KM7","RTR Customer","It was my first black tie wedding!","First off, the dress is stunning. I got so many compliments. The only downside is the chest area was quite large on me (cup size 34-B) and I was constantly worried I was revealing myself. While standing it wasn't bad but when sitting, without double sided tape, the girls would definitely be out (ifyouknowwhatI'msaying). I would probably not rent it again just for the peace of mind.

I think it probably would have looked OK on someone who didn't have a lot going on in the bust area. The XL ended up being too big but it wasn't that long. I personally like to cover my shoes for the most part with long dresses but this one I was probably an inch to 2 inches shorter than what I would've liked.","November 17, 2019","Wedding"

Also, I am busty so these armholes showed my bra on either side - I couldn't have work this without a shirt underneath or a cardigan or soMething.

The dress wanted a longer torso and a couple inches; you can see the extra fabric around my waist and it grazed my ankles in a way I didn't love. The waist is very tight and doesn't give. The dress needs tits to fill it out. The arms are a little droopy and it was a bit hard to lift my arms over my head on the dance floor. (But it was still very dance-able.) The back neck clasp came undone several times (I think due to my height). All that said, its beyond beautiful and was fun to wear, even though I had to hold my breath the whole night.

I paired it with flat brown Grecian sandals was complimented by the most chic local women on how lovely I looked and how fitting it was for the setting. Surprised to find it was such a substantial cotton fabric and less red-white-blue, more red-white-blue-orange-pink, which ended up working better for me anyway, as I wore a complimentary orange/pink/white smocked bikini underneath that provided for some more coverage. It is a bit low cut for daytime, and since I sized up probably unnecessarily (options offerred were S or M - not number sizing - but a 6 arrived), it was a little longer than it needed to be and the shape wasn't really doing my figure any favors. Would go with the 4 if I were to rent it again. Still, it was somehow classic in that quaint Sound of Music way and felt completely right!","October 25, 2019","Large"

Completely smashed bust and the buttons were pulling so you could tell it was too small. A larger size would have been too large in the skirt because the skirt already had extra fabric as it was. Perhaps the extra fabric should have been used for the waist/bust...? The shoulder straps were long which was odd given how small the rest of the top was. Super cute print though and would have been amazing if it was a better fit. Not sure how to recommend sizing to anyone....but if you have any bust at all you should size up.","October 9, 2019","Small"

But the straps are very long and the bust itself is sized appropriately. So I couldn't keep the straps up and could NOT wear a bra with the dress because it hit me so low.

Note that there is no zipper on this dress, the dress pulls on over the head and then the draw string is pulled tight on the sides to bring in the waist. This style reminds me of fashion popular in Japan. I'm a girly girl so this dress is perfect for me. I got a ton of compliments on her pretty this dress was by strangers just walking around town.

However it is a total disappointment. It's a very light summary chiffon material and runs more like a 10 in the waist. It fit my chest- which was shocking considering how much tighter it was in the waist. It also doesn't wrap- there's just this flap of material down the front and them belt, that doesn't really do anything besides keep the flap down is sewn on.","October 30, 2019","Work"

Got compliments all day. I (long torso, curvy on top and bottom, small waist) found that it fit true to size, which surprised me because I expect to have to go up a size with higher-end designers, especially to accommodate my wider hips and booty. I ordered this in a 4 and 6, and could have worn either, but preferred the 4 for the narrower fit in the shoulders. As other reviewers have noted, this is not a true wrap dress. But the belt is adjustable, which is great for a better fit for those of us with hourglass and pear shapes.","October 1, 2019","True to Size"

I was unsure it would fit because I have a 32DDD bust that needs a good amount of support. This dress was surprisingly supportive because of the adjustable tie back. I did not wear a bra because it has an open back. I have a slim, athletic build; for reference, I am 5'6'' and 135 lbs. I wore a size 4 but could probably have worn a size 2 as well. I do not have much of a backside so the fabric gathered a little more than desired in the front/abdomen area. If I rent again, i will most likely get the size 2 because of this extra fabric.

I ended up not wearing it because I thought the other items I had fit better and were a little more appropriate for a black tie wedding event. 26 sized waist, 32C, 125 LBS. hope this review helps! Pros: friendly for girls with hips/booty. Extenuates your waist area and hugs your top if you have a small bust. Cons: definitely will need to wear shape wear if you are concerned about your waist sticking out in any way. Nude strapless bra is a must.","August 19, 2019","Wedding"

I find that Christian Siriano designs tend to run a bit small, so I ordered a size 6, rather than my typical size 4, and am very glad I did. (A quick warning to tall girls that this ran a bit short in the bodice, as well as in overall length, so you may want to consider ordering the long version, if available.) Also, the material in the mid-section is a little clingy and not very forgiving, so I wore some shape wear for extra confidence, but it probably wasn't necessary. I went bra-less, but a regular strapless bra would probably work just fine. Overall, this was a comfortable, classy outfit for a fun girls day, and I would highly recommend renting it.","February 12, 2019","Other"

Awkward length for my 5'6 frame. Overall I would recommend. It is worth dealing with the design flaws to wear this beautiful piece.","February 2, 2019","Date"

Perfect wide leg for larger booty and thighs!","I got this to try on for a potential cruise dinner outfit (for the fancier night). I LOVEDDD the color and so did my husband. The material is so stretchy and comfortable. I was nervous that it would be too tight around my stomach show where your belly button is but it has a very smart seam right down the middle so that it cuts the belly button in half and smooths it out. One caveat though -- the material will show under garments (as you can see from my lace underwear) so make sure you have seamless underwear or even Spanx to keep things nice and smooth. I'm not wearing a bra in the photo but would probably wear nipple covers just in case it got cold (if you catch my drift, lol). Overall this is a beautiful jumpsuit and will definitely rent again for a wedding or even a fancy date night with my husband! Also, I ordered the 6L without knowing and it was the perfect length for my longer legs and grazed the floor on my tippy toes.","January 8, 2019","True to Size"

It was so comfortable and easy to wear. I was able to break it down on the dance floor all night. Lots of compliments all night as well. Do make sure you have a bathroom buddy bc the zipper goes up the middle of your back and not the side, making it impossible to unzip and zip on your own. Oh and I had to order the long bc regular was unavailable. I was a little worried bc I'm only 5'6 and thought it would end up much too long to wear, BUT I'm so glad I did bc it would have looked weird if it was any shorter.

I opted for a backup size because I can sometimes fluctuate between a size 0 and size 2. There's a hook and eye at the bust, which was much appreciated, since I have a smaller bust and narrow shoulders, often making it hard to fit into tops/dresses. I received many compliments. Also, I'm glad I didn't have to pay $545 for this dress. This was my first RTR experience. The dresses were dry cleaned and packed into the bag with care. The delivery vessel is very neat and easy to transport. The return process was very straight-forward. I look forward to my next rental.","June 10, 2019","Wedding"

I wanted to dress it down and couldn't really. Too much cleavage, I wore it as-is but I was too aware of it. I usually don't mind that at all, but it opens sideways so in some positions you share a panoramic view of your bra with the world.

I tried on the 14R, but could have fit in the 12R due to the size of the waist. It's not a true wrap dress (side zip) so you can't adjust it much smaller with the tie. There was a lot of fabric in the chest, which I'm sure is great for the ladies with a larger bust. For someone on the smaller side, I wish it was more low cut so it had a little bit more sex appeal (I don't need it to go down to my navel but like, let's show the girls off while I'm young, ya know?). Overall, the fabric was beautiful and flowy. The dress was lined, but would definitely need a lighter or neutral undie. I was going to wear black spanx beneath it, but you could see them easily.","February 8, 2020","Large"

I brought it with me on vacation and I wore it several times. The fabric is breathable and flows so nicely. I will say this dress is heavy and has lots of fabric, so it will take up a lot of space in your luggage because of that I opted to actually wear it on the plane home because I needed the space. Also, the buttons are a bit annoying to fasten on and off, I couldn't do the top button for fear of it popping-the fabric has zero stretch. Still a great rent!","June 18, 2019","Vacation"

This is a wrap-around dress that fastens with a hook and the waist. It also has a hook at the bust, which you can fasten or not, depending on how much cleavage you want to show. Note that the waist will be very snug. If you have a large tummy area, consider sizing up. There wasn't a larger size available for me, so I used a safety pin discreetly at the waist. Also note that because it's a wrap dress, a gust of wind will easily blow the skirt open.

Looks and feels like a lightly textured silk, but is poly blend woven fabric. I thought it would be jersey, it's not and I'm so happy! Zoom in on pic to see texture (I have more pics on Instagram at agentcheryl). It fit perfectly true to size. The cutout on side is adjustable, so you can control how much skin you're comfortable exposing (I cranked it in). It is lined. There's a button at the neck to get in and out of it. If you don't have hips, the cutout will give the illusion of hips. If you do have hips 🙋‍♀️ this will accentuate. Stay well out there my RTR family! 🥰🤗","April 23, 2020","True to Size"

The downside is the straps are like a bra with adjusters on the back that kept loosening so I kept having someone tighten them for me through the night. It's a heavy dress so they kept slipping. Would recommend pinning or taping them. Also the lining in the bra poked up a little bit could be taped if needed. Overall really fun, comfortable and unique dress.","January 31, 2019","Wedding"

It is SO flattering. My mommy belly was WELL hidden under the pleats and layers. If you are very busty, this dress will be great for you. I'm pretty small up top and had to wear a padded bra inside the built in cups and tie the straps to give a ""halter"" look. The material is sooo pretty.

I kept wanting to twirl! I did wear tights, which was a mistake, since the fabric kept clinging. Next time I'd wear bare-legged so it would fall and flow appropriately.

It's pretty versatile too - I dressed it up with some strappy sandals and jewelry for a wedding welcome party, and then, later threw some white sneakers on with it and it looked just as good.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LMT2","Lana","Literally the best spring/summer dress","The fit is perfect. Fitted enough to show off your waist but loose enough to feel comfortable. A large amount of décolleté (that somehow manages to look elegant) and a relatively modest hemline, without looking frumpy. The sleeves and detail help make it look super modern. I live in Florida, so I rented it to just wear in my daily life. Came across some festival tickets, so I paired it with fun sunnies and dad sneaks -- it was a lewk that fit the occasion without looking granola. What makes this dress special is (in this climate, anyways) you could literally wear this dress anywhere just by changing your accessories. I would feel as confident wearing it to work or dinner as I did to the show. Also, if you live or are traveling in the tropics this dress is perfect. I was cool enough when it was in the mid 80s and sunny, and the sleeves prevented me from getting chilly when the sun set and it got windier.

I would rent it again but just for a nice dinner where as the event I was going to was a very formal occasion.

The shape is good if you are an hourglass or pear because it does flatter the waist, but would look good on others. The bust runs a little small.

However, the slit in the front is super revealing when you walk because the fabric is not sewn down, the entire front of the dress is a more like a wrap/flap if that makes sense. While standing the slit is perfect and very chic. But when you walk, your entire leg is visible.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FEA1","RTR Customer","great dress for a wedding!","Absolutely stunning dress, got quite a few compliments. I usually wear between an 10 and a 12, and ordered a 12 because it was all they had. It fit like a glove. I have a large bust, a large rib cage, average hips, and most of my weight is centered in that pesky tire around my waist. This dress fit snugly but hid any problem areas due to the beautiful ruching. I would say this dress is accurate to size if your measurements are fairly proportionate to each other (ie. I am fairly evenly distributed), as it is a sheath dress with very little stretch or forgiveness. I wore a normal bra with it, though wide straps would certainly show with the thin straps of the dress. I am of average height, and so the dress hit right around my shins. I usually tend to avoid dresses like this because I don't want to appear shorter than I am, but the slit in the dress that runs up to about the knee/lower thigh, made up for this. Overall, I will absolutely be renting this dress again.","October 22, 2019","True to Size"

It's a very elegant silhouette. My boyfriend informed me it would be ""too extra"" to wear to the event we are going to, but I like it so much it makes me wish I had an appropriately extra place to go in it!

I guessed on size and the 16 was on the edge of too tight but the 18 wasn't available. It showed too much back for me to be really comfortable and would have been a struggle to find a strapless bra for. That said, the dress was gorgeous and really well made and I was disappointed not to wear it.","January 27, 2020","Formal Affair"

It was my second choice when I ordered it, but I fell in love when it arrived. It felt like I was on the runway the entire evening. The only con was the two eye-hooks holding the back neck piece together came undone three different times while dancing. The front of the dress stayed put, but I was nervous it would cause a scene. If you are going to sit and look pretty or not have your hands up while dancing, this dress shouldn't be a problem.","December 16, 2019","Formal Affair"

It was my back up but I was VERY torn after trying it on about whether to go with this one! Fit was perfect (5'9"" 145-150# 34 D) and forgiving of my broad shoulders and straight waist. Warning for the very tall - length in the L was not super long - a 1-2 inch heel would have been it for me. I also would have needed some serious boob tape action as it was not fitted enough for me to go without a bra.

I am really a size 8 or 10 on the top and a size 12 through my waist and hips. I tried the 12 and the chest area was ridiculously big on me. The 10L fit me like a glove, a tight glove.... but with a girdle it was perfect. It was snug all over and held everything in. It wasn't uncomfortable anywhere and I could dance for like 5 hours straight. I loved this dress and got a TON of compliments!","October 22, 2019","Wedding"

The belt here was a little loose, but looked even better when tied securely. It moves like a dream- wish I could upload a video! Very flattering and forgiving around the midsection because the waist is cinched and the pant legs are so wide, so the proportions make you look tall and lean. Wrinkles easily, so be ready to steam or iron upon arrival. I'm 5'4"" and it looked like I'd had it hemmed with a 4"" heel. Highly recommend","October 5, 2019","Date"

Yes, it's a lot of fabric - you're kicking weighty (not heavy) fabric with each step. Yes, it's a bit long (I'm 5'7"" and I was fine in 5"" heels). Yes, it's low cut...but it is stunning! Challenges: bathroom (lots of fabric on the ground), walking up stairs (my heels would get caught every once in a while), and I did safety pin the front down to be work appropriate. Pros: it is extremely comfortable (perfect for traveling), it irons well, the pockets are extremely deep, and the fit is flattering.

I've had trouble getting dresses zipped all the way up lately because of my curvy hips and large bust so the low back and zipper was perfect.

I had to have RTR overnight me a bigger size because I just couldn't breathe in the original requested size. It does not stretch. You cannot wear a bra with it because the back is low. You sort of need to be top heavy to fill the dress and that's tough when you can't really wear a bra. The straps were loose so make sure to get double sided tape to keep it up.

I'm pear shaped, typically a size 10 in dresses to accommodate my hips (which measure somewhere in the 40"" range). But the size 8 fit like a glove. I tried it on without shapewear and it fit fine but ended up choosing to wear some just to give myself a little more room in the hips. There is no stretch in the fabric. But it was beyond comfortable, I could sit, stand, dance. I think if you are a true hourglass shape, you would wear your regular size but pear shapes could likely size down so your bust fits. Highly recommend this one. Got compliments all night.","July 22, 2019","Formal Affair"

This dress has a little padding so made my chest look big (for me!). Wore a strapless bra underneath. Only con is that it's hard to do the clasp up by the neck by yourself.

Probably would have gone with the 0Petite had it been available, but the Regular length wasn't too bad with ~4inch heels (I'm 5'2""). As other reviewers mention the straps are too long and non-adjustable. I tacked mine to fit me with a few pieces of thread. Used sticky tape for the triangles at the front just to feel more secure. Would rent again!","November 5, 2019","Wedding"

I received so many compliments and it fit my body type perfectly. I didn't wear a bra and my cleavage was appropriate for a wedding, but still made me feel sexy. This was actually a last minute dress when my original dress wasn't available two days before my event and I guess everything happens for a reason. RENT THIS DRESS!!","November 4, 2019","Wedding"

I agree with other reviewers, straps are very long, I was prepared for it but definitely had to adjust them. Dress came with some pretty deep wrinkles but they flattened out easily. It had obviously been well worn and there were a few very small holes, but thankfully they were not noticeable unless you were up close. I have a narrow rib cage but did find that the dress was very narrow around the chest, it fit but was snug, especially for being more roomy everywhere else.

This dress fit perfectly everywhere except the straps. They were too long and had to be clipped together into a racerback style.

True to size if a thicker torso or large chest but size down if thinner torso or smaller chest. I got tons of compliments, but unfortunately another girl at the wedding had the same dress on! :-( Not what you hope to have happen. But either way, it was a blast to dance in and I loved the dress. Has lines of metallic tan/gold, silver, light pink, black/gray, and base is cream. Goes great with anything!!","August 20, 2019","Wedding"

I wore my hair down which covered the pin well enough for me. Pinning the straps also brought the deep V up a little bit, which I personally found the additional coverage to be more in my comfort zone.

The material is linen and the skirt is draped and heavy with material so it floats and feels a bit magical. I'm 5-5 and would have needed to wear big heels to not have it drag on floor (just an FYI). Also, though this wasn't the reason i didn't wear it, the double belt was impossible for me to figure out. I spent a good 15 minutes trying to figure out how it make it lay properly (including googling and so forth), to no avail. Bravo to anyone that's able to master the the belt; you deserve an advanced degree.

I'm wearing 3-4"" wedges and at 5-6"" it's barely off the ground. This plus the fullness makes stairs a little tricky (fearing a J-law moment).

The 16 definitely would have been a better fit, but I swapped their belt for a skinny black leather belt of my own so I could cinch in the waist, and it looked great for a one-night wear, since the dress is supposed to be flowy and the excess fabric wasn't too noticeable. I'm 5'9, and it was a perfect length with 2 inch block heels. Shorter gals would need very high shoes or it would drag. The dress is linen, and has beautiful hang and movement.

The mock neck looks normal on the model but it's a little stretched out and may droop. Finally, the opaque part of the dress above your knees can ride up - be sure not to accidentally flash your crotch.

I'm giving it 4 stars for three reasons: First, I have a lot of *assets* so the dress was a little short in the back and I found myself pulling it down fairly often. Second, the bodice has metal boning, so if you are smaller-chested the top may run large. I ended up wearing a strapless pushup bra to fill it out a little. Third, the midriff lace was right at belly-button level on me, which was a little awkward. I think this dress would be perfect for hourglass-shaped women.

I was also impressed that I had full-range of motion (especially while running after a toddler during the wedding). I was able to crouch, bend, etc. easily.

The longer length of the sleeves made it feel just a touch more luxe. M was a bit roomy, though an S I think would have been contrary to the intention of the design (too tight and not as 'effortless'). The fabric is a BEAUTIFUL color, very rich and light catching. All in all, a fun dress for a girl's night out, but certainly not, in my mind, for a special occasion. I liked it on me, but it didn't feel any more special than a mini dress from F21...aside from the fact it's made in the USA.","December 10, 2018","Party"

I was not expecting it to be structured on the bottom since the skirt is more flowy but the layer underneath is fitted and that made it more flattering and slimming. I usually fit comfortably in a 6 and lots of reviews said it ran large so I for a 4 and 6 but the 6 was pretty darn hard to zip.

Between the shirt and my jeans only a small part of my stomach was showing but really barely any. I wore it with just a black bra underneath and it worked out wonderfully. I think it runs true to size. I don't have a full chest but I can see if someone did that the button that holds it together might pop open. Overall I would definitely rent it again.

I rented for a cruise and paired it with some spicy red shoes and thought they worked well. The downside is it didn't seem like it's meant for larger chested gals as I spent the evening pulling up the fabric to cover my goodies. You could probably wear a strapless bra with this one but I just used nipple covers and they did the trick.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM647","Tori","Hands down, my favorite RtR dress ever (see notes for tall girls)","I loved everything about this dress! Leaving a detailed review so you will get the info you need to love it, too! 2 photos attached to help! Style: The fabric gathering on the left side is so unique and feminine, but it doesn't add bulk to your waist or hips. The fabric pattern, an iridescent sort of rainbow stained glass, keeps it from being too frothy or sweet. Color: As other reviews have noted, the color is a bit hard to pinpoint. Scroll through the 3 pics I'm attaching here - one has the dress laying against a grey pillowcase and next to a bright yellow gold necklace (from RtR). I decided the necklace was too gold to really work, but silver didn't work either. I went with a bronze metal necklace, but I think a black metal would look great, too. The jewel tones throughout the dress give you lots of colors to work with for accessories and shoes. Soft gold shoes (see note below on what I chose) worked well. Length and Size: Ideally, I would have rented this in a 4L, but the closest I could get was a 6R. I ended up wearing the dress with 1"" heel sandals (Nina brand, Shane style) so it wouldn't be too short. That gave me just a hint of a train in the back. Size-wise, it was too big on top for me, both in the waist and the chest, but I was able to make it work with some safety pins inside the dress and fashion tape around the chest area. I got more compliments wearing this dress than I ever have at any other event!","February 24, 2020","True to Size"

Not a dress you can wear just anywhere but if you want a make a statement this is THE ONE! Size up if you have a larger rib cage. Mine is smaller than the rest of me and it was snug.

The 10 wouldn't fit over my chest so I had to go with the 14 and although it was big, I was able to add a strapless bra and I only had to worry about it falling down a few times. I want to be very clear, it wasn't snug at all, so if you like the snug mermaid look and you are similar to my size you want to get your exact size!

I made a last minute rental and had to wear the 4R which was slightly big in the chest for me but I was able to make it work. I am 5'6"" with long legs and the regular fit great in length. I tried on a 2 petite (that's all that was available in a second size) and the fit was better but it was way too short. If I had worn higher heels I would have needed the 4long.

Cons: warm/heavy, the drawstring isn't elastic at all, and the cinching on the sleeves is super tight and uncomfortable (esp since I wore my sleeves up higher on my forearms). Also worth noting is you can wear it in a bunch of different ways- I wore it unbuttoned like a v neck, but I also tried it buttoned all the way up, sleeves up vs down, waist tied vs loose like a shift, and even unbuttoned more to make it off-the-shoulders.","June 27, 2019","Other"

Running true to size with a bit of stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and more loose at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are able to wear a standard bra with this dress. At 5’4”, the length hit mid-thigh on me. The pattern on the dress is pretty in person and the option to wear the sleeves up or down makes it unique option to wear on those tricky spring weather days!

The shape is not super flattering (at least not on my body), and it doesn't do much to show your waist or your butt, but it's so bold and dramatic that I don't think the fit mattered much.

It hugged my body a bit better than on the model. I'm busty, long-limbed, and athletic and this honestly felt like sparkly pajamas. I did wear spanx, and honestly the bathroom trip wasn't nearly as bad as my other jumpsuits that zip up the back. Wish I could've kept it.","January 28, 2020","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ADP95","Heather","Best fitting romper, but not my style .","I don't have the figure to wear a romper. I am pear shaped , so if a romper fits my hips, it is too big everywhere else. This fit really well . The floral layer covered all the awkward and imperfect areas ,so it looked fine and felt custom made. Something about it , though, it just not my style . Strong 90s feel. I sent it back without wearing.","April 24, 2020","True to Size"

I have a larger chest [36 in] so I recommend sizing up if you have some boobies too because it fit great over ""the girls"" and was only a little big on the rest of my body.

The cut and length were perfect for my 5'7"" frame. I paired it was pumps but it could easily go with sandals. I received a ton of compliments at the office.

I made it work for a day out with family. The floral design is beautiful, the fabric is very thick and a bit stretchy, it really feels high quality.

My backup was the 10, which could have worked too, but the fit was a bit too loose on top. The straps are adjustable, which made it fit a lot better for me.

The 4 fit much better, a bit snug in the rib cage too and I'm not big busted. It's roomy in the hips if you have a larger bottom. I'm pretty narrow in the hips and there was plenty of fabric I could pinch on the side, but you couldn't tell. The fabric has some give in it but it very soft and comfy.

My measurements are 38""-30""-39"" for reference. I really appreciate the space in the chest so that nothing was being squeezed. No need for a bra, either, but plenty of support. It was a warm evening- mid 80s- and I didn't feel too warm in the fabric. I got a lot of compliments - the bride said ""you look GOOD!"" and my husband was a huge fan, too.

Pros: Glitzy, but not too over-the-top. Slit is not too high, and the deep V is very flattering. Cons: This was very big in the bust and rib cage for me, but it fit my hips, so I doubt the 14 would have been any better. I'd recommend this dress for someone who is more proportionate (busty with big hips, or hips small enough to go down a size to match the smaller bust).","January 12, 2020","Large"

Be prepared to show some cleavage if you’re busty but overall it’s a beautiful dress. I’m 5’7 and wore 2-3 inch heels and the 4L (140 lbs) and the length was absolutely perfect.

The only thing that surprised me was how short the lining was for the skirt, which is sheer enough to be able to see through from close.

I ordered my usual size 0, but I couldn't get it zipped up. The tag equates 0 with XXXS, so no wonder! With my measurements I should have sized up to a 2 or maybe even a 4. The fabric detail was stunning though! Note the neckline is not for extra full busts.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THF12","Stephanie","Stunning fabric and flattering cut even on a petite frame","The fabric of this dress was so elegant and not as fragile as some gown with sheer overlays. The top to the chest is sheer and there are sheer cutouts at the sidewaists. Overall, I’d say the other reviews I read are right, in that this dress does run small. I’m generally a 0/00 with a 24” waist, and this dress fit me wonderfully. The tag says 0R and XXXS so keep that in mind if going with this size. There is no give at the hips to get it on as the zipper goes just below waist. I love a good bodice that doesn’t require a bra, this dress has a nice liner and structure at the chest for those who need minimal to moderate support. It definitely holds it all in! The liner below the skirt goes above knee or mid thigh for those who are taller. Being petite, this dress was a full length on me, and it was perfect with a small kitten heel height. No high heels as the even was outside in grass and gravel. I received complements all night, and only wish I had a reason to wear this dress again! But instead I think I’ll just rent another one ;)","June 23, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THF12","Michelle","So many compliments and really fun to dance in.","-As many reviews said, it does run a little small. I ordered my regular size (4) and a size up (6) and ended up wearing the size 6, mainly because the lining skirt is fairly short with shear outer fabricand the size 6 was a little longer in that respect. I probably would have been fine in my true size but maybe would not have been as comfortable dancing at the wedding. -The neckline makes things so easy! You don't need to worry about fashion tape or ""falling out"" and I just wore a regular black bra. -This dress looks beautiful on curves and is super fun for dancing- especially Latin style dancing or anything where your hip movements are emphasized. It's also really pretty to see the skirt twirl up and around whenever you are being spun around. -The fabric is not itchy or irritating at all. -The length was perfect for me in 3"" heels.","May 3, 2019","Small"

It's really top quality velvet, was very warm in the dead of winter and actually stayed put even when dancing! It has a little shelf bra built in of the same material which helps hold the girls up. I rented a small and a medium and was hard pressed to figure out which was with. I think the small was a little shorter and that's the one I chose. It was sexy, comfy and like I said I danced all night in it! I was apprehensive because of the wya the sleeves were shown in the picture (think Seinfeld puffy sleeves episode, lol) but once I looked at it on real people I saw it wasn't as ridiculous and gave the outfit some body. It is hard putting on your coat with them though but it's a minor, temporary issue if you're going somewhere indoors. I would rent and recommend this top!","March 13, 2019","Party"

The length was good and there wasn't a lot of excess fabric in the torso, could be worn tucked or untucked.

I wore this to a night on the town with a friend and paired it with high waisted jeans and cognac color thigh high boots and recieved several compliments. The V on this top is quite deep, so be sure you're okay with showing quite a bit of cleavage. It's also quite cropped, and fit me much more cropped than it did the model (I am 5'7"" with a ""normal"" torso length), so I am glad I was wearing super high waisted jeans. I found that it kept riding up even higher throughout the night, but it wasn't overly bothersome for me. If you're between sizes, I would say size up, because some of the riding up may have been due to it being a little snug on my tummy. Overall, I was pleased with this rental.","November 18, 2019","Small"

However, as mentioned, the straps make this dress a terrible idea unless you plan to keep your arms at your side all night.

I didn’t not wear a bra and the dress was tight enough on my chest that everything was held together. My booty and thighs are on the bigger side so the tightest part of the dressers was on the upper thighs and walking was at times difficult (not able to take any big strides and I had to pull the dress up to dance).

Also, I would recommend this for a 60-70 degree day unless worn with shorts because this will get hot in anything above that. The buttons do take a while to close, but once on the top is great. If you have a larger bust I also recommend sizing up because there is not a lot of room up top and there is no stretch in the fabrication.I liked that the sleeves could be worn on or off the shoulders. Definitely recommend.","May 20, 2019","True to Size"

Usually a 6 or an 8 in dresses and went with the 8 only to get a bit more room to accommodate for drinking/eating. NOT FORGIVING AT ALL. I wish I chose shape wear that went up to my bust because the Spanx I wore cut right above my hips and you could see the line in many photos. I wore 5in heels and the train just barely skimmed the ground, which was perfect. I meant to wear a strapless bra, but forgot and it wasn't the end of the world as the straps are completely adjustable (I really just wanted a more perky shape tbh).

Did NOT like the fit at the bust, which is why this is a 'No' from me. Sure I'm itty bitty titty committee, but I have no problem with that...this just didn't hit right, even with those silicone pasty things slapped on. Perhaps a proportion issue. The fabric is luxurious with a beautiful hand and weight. Loved it around my rather up and down/straight body...I never look that curvy so it's a fun thing for me to see on myself! Didn't love how the seam on the inside of the ""train"" was visible, I found it glaring and unfinished considering the $$$ of this piece. The slip is also shorter than the dress, 2 things that I didn't notice much from the pics but that kept stopping my eye when I had it on.

The romper fit perfectly and the stunning, flowing skirt (with pockets!) could be adjusted to reveal either leg or the center covering the romper. I wore this to my company awards ceremony and for this event the dress was fun and sophisticated AND comfortable . I could dance in this dress with the romper with no worries about exposing anything. The romper was challenging to go to the bathroom with, but I loved it regardless - I will rent again! Wish I owned it!

Fun formal affair look","This dress was a show stopper all night and was perfect for the after party as well because the detachable skirt could be removed. Loved the fit and look of it. Does run small in chest area due to side zipper, had to size up. 10R was worn due 8R was not available to rent however I do feel the 8R would've worked and helped it be more fitted in the stomach area. One size up recommendation for this dress.","December 21, 2019","Formal Affair"

I'm 5'7 and wore three inch heels and the back of the dress doesn't touch the floor. It doesn't look bad though because it's a high low. I think with Jay Godfrey, he runs TTS or slightly smaller, so I'd get the bigger back up size. I ended up wearing the 8, as the 6 was too tight in the romper. Felt very beautiful in this, but just remember it is two pieces when using the restroom! Great rental!","December 21, 2019","Formal Affair"

Loved the dress, my favorite piece I have ever rented! The watch out is that this is a ROMPER, with a skirt that you step into and hook and zip. When going to the bathroom understand you have to take off the skirt, struggle with the side zipper and then take off the entire romper (and pray the bathroom has a hook). Then you must put back in the romper, fight with the side zipper, then get the skirt back on. It's a process but worth it.","December 17, 2019","Formal Affair"

I definitely felt like a princess. It was different from all the other dresses at the event as well. The skirt overlay was so fun. The only negative is that the skirt ran a bit big for my waist and a tiny bit long. The larger waist made it slide down a bit below the waistline of the romper at times. Not the best look. I kept having to pull it up but I still loved the dress and got so many compliments!","December 16, 2019","Formal Affair"

Cons: - it's a bit tight in the seat - size up. - the skirt is long. It creates a train effect and is stunning but my husband kept stepping on it all night.

I’m small up top, so had to wear a very padded strapless bra and then use some fashion tape to keep the side with no shoulder from exposing the top part of my bra in the front. Other than that, it looked gorgeous! I felt super glamorous and got tons of compliments. I was definitely the best and most elegantly dressed lady at the Christmas party.

Torso length and legs had good fit, waist was a bit large, but I am quite petite. At 5'2"" with 4 inch heals the skirt was just sweeping the floor.

Perfect for day to night: The 1 shoulder with bow detail, the detachable high low skirt that converts to a romper....Great for dancing the night away! Fit-wise, I have a small chest so the top was a little loose, whereas the waist was pretty snug. Also the skirt is quite long and flowy, so beware of ppl stepping on it. I wore with high heels to a wedding in wine country and paired with the Nocturne earrings and a fur coat for the evening chill. Best RTR rental!","November 16, 2019","Wedding"

I'm typically between a 4 and 6 depending on fit and the 4 torso length in the romper was shorter so I went with the 6 which was perfect. The color was phenomenal and I got so many compliments that my husband said he felt like the third wheel to me and the dress. The skirt overlay is definitely a statement, I had to pick it up to walk up/down stairs, and it was a blast to dance in too.","November 4, 2019","Formal Affair"

There is a ribbon for a belt which gives nice shape. Warning!!! It's a very thin dress and you must have a slip or wear yoga pants underneath or you can see through it. It's very thin. Also, the night I wore it there was so much static that it cling to me the entire time.

The RTR bar code showed through it so it was unusable. Also, the lack of structure of the dress at the waistline with this flimsy belt caused it not to stay lined up on the seam. (Pictured with my own belt in a similar style. Later in the day I was tied of fussing with lining up at the seam and removed the belt entirely.) The neutral Thin silk fabric makes a slip a must.

I also wore a wide leather belt, and that really pulled in the waist. It ran small on me through the rib cage/bust, but there is extra material at the ""almost"" empire waist;the belt helped to keep it from ""poofing out"" at my tummy.

This was the first jumpsuit I ever wore... and it will probably be my last. Individually, these would've been great items, but I didn't love it as a whole. Looked a lot like a Pyjama, alternatively I felt like a fancy 1940s factory worker. Let's just say this just wasn't for me. It was also very tight, i can't attest to this running large at all.

(Most my clothes are 2s and 4s). I think I could have worn a 2 and just not worn such a padded bra. If I didn't wear a padded bra, the bust would have been loose. I am 5'3 so it was a touch below the knee but still looked great. Overall the appliqué detail was luxurious and nobody had my dress. Will be using RTR in the future 100%!!!","July 14, 2019","Wedding"

The dress is very fancy and I got a lot of compliments all evening long. But it's also very comfortable, and I was able to dance all night long with no pulling, riding up, or discomfort. I had read you could go braless in this dress but I wanted to wear my bra (for the dancing!); it is a True&Co nude bra which was basically invisible through the embroidery.

I'm short, so the dress was grazing around my knees. The 16 fit with lots of room to move around, but my guess is that I would have been comfortable in the 14 too. The lace work is stunning and for those complaining of it not laying flat, I had no issues. I can't help searching my calendar for another reason to rent this again.

Be warned though either way, the sleeves were so tight on my arms and this was probably a size too big on me everywhere else.

The size 8 wasn’t exactly comfortable, but it zipped with no problem and fit like a glove.

Besides that, it's a really fun dress and fit the theme of this eclectic wedding so well.","September 18, 2019","Small"

Worth it because the dress is stunning and a work of art.","The dress is absolutely stunning and extremely well made.. The only thing is the arms could have used some extra wiggle room.. the size 6 arms fit better but the body of the size 4 was much more flattering so I went with my normal size of 4. It may be one of the most beautiful dresses I've ever worn and so in that respect I still give it top stars even though the arms will give you a complex.

The neckline was also pretty itchy, but overall the dress was very flattering and I loved it.","September 11, 2019","Small"

I ordered a 4 and a 6, and while they both fit me in the body, the arms on the 4 were a bit tight. Ultimately wore the 6 and it fit me as if it were made for me. The detailing and the colors are just gorgeous. Danced the night away, and felt like a million bucks. Will 100% be renting this beauty again in the future.","September 7, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN161","RTR Customer","Beautiful dress and lots of compliments","Loved the look of this dress! Lots of compliments. The material is heavy and no stretch, but really not a problem. The arms are tight like others have said. By 3ish hours I wanted to take it off just because of the arms. I tried putting a little chafing cream before and maybe it helped a bit. I also tried it on with the arms tucked in like others suggested and this is definitely an option. I just liked it better with the arms. I'm 5'4 and about 155lbs and both the 8 and 10 fit well. I went with the 8 because it fit my chest better, but the 10 was more comfortable through the hips and arms. Since the 8 was tighter in the hips, I did notice the pink layer would ride up a bit as I walked and sat down. It wasn't so much that it was a problem though. I wore a nude bra underneath that you could see if you looked really closely at the sheer part, but I don't think anyone could notice. The rest of the dress is not see through so you don't need to worry about what to wear underneath. Black shoes and accessories for well as there is black in the dress. Nude would work too. I would highly recommend the dress for the style and look. It was worth the slight discomfort in the arms.","September 3, 2019","True to Size"

I hated the arm cuffs, they were so uncomfortable but I tucked them in as other reviews said to & the dress was perfect. I got so many compliments. I was a little nervous about being hot because this dress is heavy & it was an outdoor summer wedding but I danced all night in it & was extremely comfortable.","August 28, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN161","RTR Customer","This dress is a showstopper.","The fit is body skimming without being restricting and it was forgiving on my hips and booty.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN161","Maggie","This dress is magical! Compliments from people of all ages all night - definitely best dressed!!","I highly recommend this dress if you want to make a statement for a formal event or an evening wedding. It really could work for any season because of the color palette and floral design elements. I thoroughly read other reviews and was a little nervous about fit, but the dressed worked perfectly. My primary size wasn't available (0) and I took a chance just ordering my back up (2), which was the perfect choice because this dress has very little give in the waist and hips. I have a very small frame and am petite through my chest and rib cage but am a little curvier in my waist and butt, not narrow like up top, and this dress is very form-fitting so if you are curvier be aware that there is no give in the fabric when considering your sizes! As for the arms, a lot of people have noted that they are tight and I agree -- the area between the arm band and shoulder is short but I wasn't uncomfortable - just know that the fabric of this dress is thick, intricate, and pretty structured - this isn't a flowy gown. Also, I'm 5'4 and wore 3 inch heels and the length was great - not tea length on me, it hit just above my ankles so worked well for a formal event. I absolutely loved this dress and received compliments from tons of people at my event and when I went out after (I never wanted the night to end!) Highly, highly recommend!","August 24, 2019","True to Size"

We stayed in a fancy hotel in Houston and had dinner/drinks. My anniversary is in March right before it gets warm here in Houston, so this dress was perfect for the cold night time weather while still being a floral pattern for spring. The dress is a wrap fit and ties high up on the waist which is flattering if you have some curves under there like me. I do have a tiny rib cage (32D), and wear small tops, etc. The small size wouldn't wrap around, so keep that in mind. I ended up wearing the Medium. The dress has a high low cut at the bottom so your shoes will show. I wore this with some strappy black chunky heels.","March 26, 2020","Small"

Like others have said it's super long for short girls but I wore 4"" heels and it wasn't that big of a deal, just be cautious on a crowded dance floor. One other fit issue is that if you have broad shoulders it may be a bit boobie. I loved wearing this dress and would absolutely rent it again.","February 2, 2020","Wedding"

Gorgeous rich navy and white print makes this work for an outdoor wedding, or a fun night out. I'm pregnant and found the style flattering (sleeves, generous bust, and adjustable tie waist, able to wear a full bra). I think my non-pregnant self would have needed tape or a pin at the bust, runs a tad large there. Potentially size down if you are smaller in the bust with a small waist, or if you are short. I am 5'8"" and was able to wear a flat shoe with 1/2"" heal, no problem. Renters under 5'6"" will probably need a heel.","June 19, 2019","Large"

Couldn't wear","I got this dress new with the tags on and I really wish I could have worn it because it's a beautiful dress. The colors are brighter and more vibrant than the RTR photo and the material feels really nice. I'm usually a 6 but I sized up and got the 8 because I think I have needed to in the past with this designer. The top was waaaay too huge. It was very low cut, and super wide. It gaped at the sides, lots of extra fabric in the bust and back/shoulders. I would have needed to gather and pin a lot of material in the back for it to fit. But the waist fit perfectly - I think the 6 might have been too tight or not zipped up. I'm really not sure who could wear this dress - ladies with smaller chests would have too much extra fabric and ladies with larger chests would totally bust out of this neckline. Maybe someone with a smaller wide-set bust could go bra-less and have less of an issue. Or maybe it just needs to be worn with a statement bralette. I'm going to try again in the 6 just because the dress is so pretty, but I don't have high hopes because of the bizarre fit.","July 2, 2019","Date"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS194","Starr","Fun to wear and super sliming","I LOVED this jumpsuit. I'm a big fan of jumpsuits in general and this one was no exception. The jumpsuit is made of black lace that is see through at the shoulders and bottom hem but I was still able to wear a black bra with it and you couldn't tell. The fabric was slightly stretchy so it fit over my rather large chest no problem while still being nipped in at the waist. I could zip it up myself about 3/4 of the way and then needed either a bathroom buddy or for my husband to zip and unzip before running into the bathroom. Fabric is not very thick so it was a bit chilly for New Years in Vegas but I survived. So cute and sliming I would definitely rent again.","January 10, 2019","Vacation"

I am so glad the others were a bust! This is my fav RTR ever. The neckline and lace is so pretty, and the jump suit is flattering and comfortable. I think there’s a tiny bit of stretch in the liner??

I did have to wear hose underneath so my belly button shadow wouldnt be seen through the dress... but it was worth the adjustments on my undergarments because I felt like a million bucks all night!

I am typically a 00 off the rack so the top half of the dress was a little big. Because there is so much material where it drapes off the shoulder, I had to put a little pin underneath to keep it from draping too low. For those who are petite, it's nothing a thick, padded bra can't help. The dress is in interesting length so matching the proper style heels is pretty important. I paired the WHITING & DAVIS-Diamond Drips Minaudiere (also from RTR) as my handbag; large pearl drop earrings and a crystal and pearl bracelet (jewelry by Sweets Jewelry). I received many compliments for the complete look. Everyone could tell the quality of the dress was very high.

The 22 was even still a bit small in the rib cage and it took 3 of my friends to zip up the dress, but it did fit. Other than that, the dress was beautiful and fit me so nicely.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL282","Jackie","Gorgeous material, and pockets were amazing!","Based on other reviews, I expected this dress to have a little more room in the bust, and the waist of the bodice was longer than I would have liked. But, I have a very short waist and fairly large boobs, so this may not affect many other women. My boobs ended up taking up part of the bodice designed for the waist, as well as filling out the cups, and that was in the larger backup size. The fabric was gorgeous, but a little thick, which made the zipper stiff at the waistband, even just taking it off the hanger. All that being said, it was a gorgeous dress, I got lots of compliments, and the pockets really are a game-changer, especially when going solo to a friend's wedding. I didn't have to leave my purse at the table, or ask a friend to hold my stuff in his pants pocket, which was very convenient!

It was stretchy yet slimming and flow-y. I am 5'7"" and the dress hit me right in the right spot but some people may find it to be too short for their liking.

It's also super comfortable and flattering (especially for those of us with a belly). I didn't get a good picture of the front, but a little bit of cleavage gives it a hint of sexiness. Amazing.

The dress does have some stretch, but i found myself having to pull the dress down as the night went on, and it caused a small amount of stretch that was a bit unflattering.

I wore it to a NYE wedding in Chicago, and the fabric and long sleeves were great for the cold night. The shoulder pads give the dress a great silhouette along with the asymmetrical skirt, and the deep green color is gorgeous (doesn't show well in pictures, though!). I was originally going to wear with sheer black tights and black pumps, but because the green is so dark, I opted for gold heels. I'm very small chested, so the deep V wasn't scandalous and I didn't need tape to keep things in place. I'm also very petite and the size 0 fit me perfectly, so it may run slightly small for some.

Also used the breast lift tape with this dress as well. There is a slip underneath the asymmetrical slit in the front. The wind caught this a few times so would use tape here if you’re planning to be outdoors for an extended period.

And yes, I am flat chested, but I think even if I had a lot more up top it would have been the same nipple extravaganza it was for me. I tried tape but that was annoying, so then I turned it around and wore it backwards (an RTR user hack someone posted on another dress from this designer) which mostly solved the nip issue but then led to a new issue which is that anytime I moved the wrong way everyone saw my butt. Cool. No chance of dancing in this thing I'll tell ya that.

Wore to a family retirement party on a very hot evening. Dress is very light and breezy and I was very comfortable all evening. Fabric is GORGEOUS- you can't tell from photo but there are snakes and moths and all kids of cool critters in the print. Very silky.","June 13, 2019","Party"

I ended up only wearing it around the resort since I had to pick up all the extra material just to walk. I also wasn't a fan of the way it wrapped, since pulling it a particular way could end up pulling apart/revealing the back side completely (luckily I wore shorts underneath).","February 10, 2020","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HTC79","Adelaide","Knockout pattern, weird fit.","The dress is a knockout. The pattern is gorgeous, the fabric is silky and rich, and the dress flows behind you when you walk. The fit is tricky, though-On the one hand, this dress runs large in the armholes and the midsection. I wore the smaller backup size, and I'm glad I ordered it! On the other, it is a true wrap dress and it's cut to have a deep neckline, so if you have broad shoulders or a wide ribcage, this dress will be MUCH lower cut on you than it is on the model! I layered a black tube top under the dress, and luckily it looked deliberate.","January 9, 2020","Large"

I am a 32C and I felt the chest area was a bit bigger than I wanted and did not provide the full support I was looking for so I did wear a strapless bra, however you do not have to! I only pulled the dress up a few times due to the slippery material of my bra. I had a drink spilled on me and the split in the dress ripped as I bent down to pick something up.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG138","Allison","Amazing Pink/Magenta strapless dress with slit was a confidence booster","Absolutely loved this dress color, fit, and style! Slightly more magenta than bright pink than in photo. Length came to lower calf for me (I'm 5'3.5"") but the slit and tight fit gave the length the perfect balance to feeling sexy without over the top (but to each their own!) I do have a more athletic build, and felt very feminine in this dress. In spite of being strapless, I was not constantly pulling the dress up even while dancing! The top had a rubber type lining to help secure the dress from slipping. However, be wary of the slit, the threading did not have a very strong hold. Both the 0 and 2 fit well which is pretty true to size for me, but I wore the 2 for a little more comfort and give for dancing. I preferred the fit of the 0 (2 had more loose fit in stomach but likely from having shorter torso and odd zipper bunching on the bum). I wore spanks too keep the lines smooth.

Form fitting, eye catching, compliments, something different, looks good in pictures, makes your booty look good Cons - unforgiving, very tight, I had to run and get a $40 pair of spanx just to make sure everything was tucked away, not very comfortable Overall, I liked the dress. However, if I had had to wear for more than 4 hours I wouldn't have survived. It was soo tight plus coupled with the spanx, it was a lot to handle. I had to make sure my posture was on point or else my belly popped out. Probably wouldn't wear it again so I'm glad it was just a rental.","July 31, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SB117","Alexis","Cute in the details","I really liked this skirt and the way the side slit and light pleating elevate the look. The only thing that bothered me was I probably tripped no less than 10 times on the front of the skirt. Either it's really long or my legs aren't long enough. It went to my ankles, not mid calf like in the model picture. Still cute but dangerous?","June 18, 2019","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AX102","Amanda","Kicky, fun skirt!","I really like this skirt! At first, not so much, it's a bit of a trial-and-error experience getting it to fit and sit right initially. And yes, there is a gap between the two ""sides"" of the wrap skirt so that's a bit of a design flaw that I'd love changed if there was a sequel to this skirt coming out. However, I was able to figure out where to place it on my waist, how to tie it so it stays on (tighten that knot, folks!) and how to rotate it just so to hide the gap. Once on and in place, this is so much fun to wear. I love how it feels when I walk. I get compliments on it every time I wear it. It has a great weight to it and while it *feels* flirty like you're wearing a ""cute little skirt"" it still has enough fabric and length to pass for work/more demure situations.","September 22, 2018","Everyday"

Running true to size with no,stretch, I recommend wearing your true size, for your primary size. and going up, for your back up. This style is a wrap skirt so you can loosedn up the midsection a bit and loose at the hips. At 5 foot the length hit just below the knee on me.

My only complaint is that the hole that you use to loop the belt through is MASSIVE. Three different people were like ""0h no! Your seam!"" and I had to explain that the belt is just too skinny and the hole is too big! I kept trying to cover it with the belt itself but I had to move a little bit! The belt is also a bit long (although that would be good if you need more space) so I did a knot instead of a bow. But really cute!","June 11, 2018","Party"

The juxtaposition of the pattern and pink background w the lizards and snakes is brilliant and I was surprised how many people didn't actually notice the reptiles but complimented the dress and later noticed the reptiles.

Since there are slits at the thigh area is more comfortable but still gives the look of a fitted dress. I can say though that since the bust area is a low-cut, wearing a bra is a bit complicated. You'd probably need to a wear a plunge-style bra or atleast a nude color so it isn't visible. There is a clip in the front that closes it a little, but you could definitely pin it if you don't want to show as much. If you have a smaller bust and are comfortable enough, you could probably get aware with no bra. This is definitely something I'd buy.","December 26, 2017","True to Size"

I would not recommend this as a maternity option.","January 20, 2020","Wedding"

I wore this dress to an outside September wedding on a horse farm in Virginia. The autumn colors and floral pattern were perfect. I'm 5'2 and I probably haven't worn a long dress since my own wedding because I didn't think I could pull the length off, but I loved how this fit. The only downside was the top part was a little too long/big for me, but I bought some fashion tape and it worked great. The dress is not lined, so I wore a slip underneath. I love this dress and would definitely recommend it.","September 17, 2018","True to Size"

It absolutely needed fashion tape to keep the front in place, but other than that it was a easy fun dress to wear.","June 6, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RT128","Jenine","Beautiful bright print.","This dress was really pretty and I received a lot of compliments. I paured it with nude mules and a neutral colored leather jacket. However, it did take a few safety pins so keep the top from opening up too much. I'm a 34B and I have a short torso. I think it would work better with someone who's torso is a little longer. I wouldnt rent it again, but it was great for the party I went to at a wine bar.","February 12, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RT128","Farah","Versatile wrap dress","This dress was so fun to wear and very comfortable. I wore it casually on vacation but it could definitely be dressed up. I think it would've fit better on someone with a larger bust (I'm a 36B and I felt as though I wasn't filling it out on top). As a result, I had to wear a tank underneath. I would definitely recommend it, but if you're small on top you may want to size down.","January 14, 2018","Vacation"

I wore it wine tasting and it was a hot day but the dress kept me cool. I had fun wearing it. I didn't get any full length pics of me in it but here is me sitting. I have a fuller bust and had not issues and loved that I could wear a normal bra.","October 11, 2017","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RT128","Michelle","GORGEOUS DRESS!","I absolutely loved the dress. I'm in between sizes and I thought a larger than usual would look better since my breasts are just super big (when I gain weight they're usually the first to increase in size). It runs LARGE so I suggest you stick to your size or even go a step-down. The wrap around feature is very flattering but if the dress runs too big the armholes and the breast front would flare out and expose you. I still enjoyed it and it made feel super girlie!","September 25, 2017","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RT128","Holly","Well-fitting and comfortable!","The wrap fit is really flattering and the fabric is light and comfy. Got complimented a couple times for the fun colors and shape! Would rent again. As noted by previous reviewers, fashion tape came in handy to wrangle the top from being too low.","September 21, 2017","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RT128","Preston","Perfect fit","Loved this dress! Perfect for a more casual party and fit well due to the wrap nature of it. Not too heavy at all and a great length. Highly recommend!","September 13, 2017","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RT128","Alyssa","RTR Team Review","What a wonderful dress! Got a ton of compliments when I wore this to a conference + dinner. The ruffle and wrap are surprisingly flattering, and the belt is adjustable for comfort. I have a smaller chest so I wish I sized down as the down was a bit billowy on me. Rent this !!","July 29, 2017","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RT128","Srideepti","Loved the fit and the print!","The dress runs a little loose so you may want to size lower than higher when you order. The waist tie lets you adjust to the right waist size. The dress did make me look very tall and I got quite a few compliments for this dress. I wore it for a party at my friend's place. The overlap of the dress is pretty good so even when there's wind, the flying of the dress wasn't bad. Very easy to wear and light weight, a nice dress to wear in summer. I felt the neck was a little deep so pinned it up in place. Easy to wear and definitely a dress I would rent again!","July 27, 2017","Large"
