I really wanted to wear it to a rehearsal dinner but I really felt like I was wearing a bag. It didn't really compliment my frame at all. But that back is absolutely gorgeous! It was lightweight and those pockets! Love! I wish it didn't just hang on me.","September 10, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TT166","RTR Customer","Super fun, comfortable dress","Dress was super fun and perfect for a wedding rehearsal and dinner. I wish I could buy it. The fabric was kind of thick but stretchy. I wear a size 8 pants and usually a size 6 dress; I ordered the 4 as backup but it was a little tight (in the inner lining only) around my hips. I didn't see much of a difference in the way the top fit between the 4 and 6. It's a very forgiving fit around the body. I would say I have a pretty lean chest/bust so for women who carry more weight up top they would have to size up for sure","September 7, 2019","Other"

I wore it to a friend's outdoor wedding rehearsal dinner in July. I am early in my second trimester, and this dress was so comfortable and perfect for my changing body and for the occasion! The dress is a bright pink and has a slip underneath the already thick-ish material. I wore a regular strapless bra and no Spanx. It was more fitted at the top, so it didn't look too oversized. Can't say enough good things about this one!","July 16, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TT166","Hillary","Fun pink dress!","Loved the dress. I wore the 4 instead of the two only because the top was a little tighter on the two around my broad shoulders. Roomy dress though. Definitely get a size down for back up.","July 6, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TT166","Jamie","Fun, flirty, and forgiving","Beautiful bright fun color for spring/summer. Looks great with a tan. The cut is very forgiving in the stomach so no Spanx required. After 4 kids that's not easy to find a flattering cut without having to wear a lot of stuff to suck you in. The back has really cute straps and best of all there are pockets!!","May 21, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TT166","Erika","So bright and fun","I rented this for the wedding of a childhood friend. The dress was perfect and the fit hid the fact that I was having drinks and food all day. It's a little tight around the legs and butt, but that may be just because I have thunder thighs. I loved the neckline, which I thought was very original. Also loved the color, which looks more neon than it appears online. Definitely bright though, so if you aren't looking for bright then it's not for you.","January 19, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TT166","Jessica","Bold with pockets","I do like the dress and the color is the “wow” factor. It even has pockets! It just makes me look larger than I am.

Worn to a September wedding and still got so many compliments on the color, even though I personally thought it was too bright! Because I'm large chested, it kind of made me a little boxy. Doesn't show any body shape at all. But again, definitely comfortable!","October 2, 2018","Wedding"

The lining and the exterior fabric make it a perfect dress for a wedding reception that called for a smart dress code in an old-school club in chilly September. Almost ankle length for my height 5""3. Such a elegant dress that's also very comfortable to wear!","September 30, 2018","Wedding"

Although the material is not stretchy, it has an amazing flow and the color and texture of the fabric really adds movement to the style. I would recommending one size up for backup and this would be most comfortable from A to C cups. Pair with some statement earrings and a cute pair of heels or flats for the perfect look!","January 10, 2018","True to Size"

I so wish it would have worked out! Everything about this dress was great except I could not get it zipped. I have too broad of a back for it. It was disappointing to say the least. I thought the fabric was lovely and soft and had a little stretch to it. The zipper area did not. If you are more athletic and broader, I don't recommend this dress.","April 22, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HB53","Hannah","Super fun fabric","I wore it to my company holiday party. It was formal without being over the top and hugged my figure without being revealing. I'm 5' 5"" and the midi length fell in a good spot.","February 10, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HB53","Lauren","Just Didn't Work","I rented this for NYE but didn't end up going out so didn't wear. I debated wearing it to work but it was a little too dressy. Plus the length is weird--it was not midi length like the picture shows but went just above my ankle. There is a slip underneath the skirt but it only goes halfway down so the dress material sticks to tights. Just doesn't work to wear.","January 16, 2019","Large"

It was conservative enough that it felt appropriate for a corporate environment but definitely not boring because of the cut and color. I found it a tiny bit hard to zip up at my back but once it was on it was totally comfortable.","December 20, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HB53","Natalie","Terrible fit","The color of this dress seemed a little darker than what is pictured, but it is still a beautiful material. Unfortunately, the black band hit right around my rib cage and was extremely tight, making it bunch up above and below the band. The fit was terrible on me, and there was no way I could wear it without looking ridiculous. Also I'm 5'4 and the dress was pretty long on me, hitting right above my ankles. This dress would probably look much better on a really tall person.","December 5, 2018","Small"

This could be easily dressed up or down, and I wore with a structured laceup oxford style bootie. If you have a larger chest like I do, I recommend sizing up. The 6, my normal size, fit perfectly but was too restricting in the bust, so I wore the 8. There is not much give in the top part of the dress or at the waist, as other reviewers mentioned. The material was warm and has a slip that makes it feel like you are wearing pajamas. The dress was super comfortable and perfect for fall! I wish I could have kept it!","October 17, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HB53","Maria","Perfect for a work holiday party!","I wore this to a holiday party at my home of my company president. The dress cut is obviously on the more conservative side, but I nonetheless felt festive due to the gleaming copper color and interestingly textured fabric. The dress was not boring, and not risqué. It was just right. As for the size: My current weight is actually 145 lbs, not 135. The size 6 cut into my waist and the skirt bunched up around my hips. The size 8 was comfortable around the waist and the skirt nicely skimmed my hips. In terms of length, it ended up reaching below my calves (so about 3-4 inches from my ankles, as opposed to 3-4 inches below my knees).","December 18, 2017","True to Size"

The waist seam was quite tight and it definitely hugs the hips, but because of the thicker fabric and flattering silhouette it was tasteful and i wasn't terribly uncomfortable. I thought the neckline and flared skirt really elevated this classic LBD. Wore regular strapless bra and Paired with green Kendra Scott earrings for color pop.","August 30, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP44","Chrissy","Classy and sexy for a formal dinner.","I loved this dress even though the fit wasn't perfect on me. Tailored dresses don't often work for me because I'm tall so usually the extra fabric for the tush is too high. But this one hugged great on back. It also doesn't hide a rounded tummy so be prepared for anything not flat to show. The bust was a bit too big so the sides winged out a bit, but it actually made the top of the dress look nice. Sharing this not-flattering pic so you can see what I mean about the tummy area. Overall the dress looked a lot nicer than this. I would recommend but I wouldn't rent again.","January 25, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP44","RTR Customer","Stylist Review","I love the flattering cut of this classic black dress by Dress The Population! This piece runs true to size so I would recommend getting your typical size as your primary and going one size up for the backup size. There is comfortable room throughout the midsection and it is a straight fit on the hips as it is a shift style dress so it does not hug the curves. This dress is great for all cup sizes as it is comfortable in the bust area and I recommend wearing a strapless bra with it. In regards to length, the dress hit me at mid calf and I'm 5,4 in height. I would pair this dress with black heels (as pictured), a sparkly necklace and or earrings and a cute statement bag.","January 14, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP44","Alexandra","Little black dress","I wasn't too ecstatic about this dress - it was a replacement because RTR sadly messed up the shipping for my original dress. What they sent was just a tad too much for what I was wearing it to. However, it's form fitting and fits well on the curves. It definitely shows the cleavage. It was kind of an odd length on me (I'm 5'3""). Not my favorite and probably won't make you stand out in the crowd but in the right setting and on the right person I think it could be sexy and/or classy.","December 27, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP44","Gena","Loved wearing this dress to my husband's company Christmas party!","I LOVED this dress! It's very flattering and also comfortable. For me, the XL was none too big, but it fit about as I would expect for my usual size 12/14. (The XXL was too big in the bust, and I'm a 38D.) There is no stretch in the bodice, however, so I do recommend getting the back-up size in the larger size. The trumpet flare was flattering on my legs--which are thicker. I'm an hourglass shape. The black material is a perfect thickness for disguising bulges. The straps stayed up great for me, but are not adjustable. The zipper sticks, so you'll want someone to help you with that. (Tip: Can't really wear a bra with this dress, and for me I had to have something. I tried taping for the first time and was pleasantly surprised that it worked great!) :)","December 11, 2018","True to Size"

The fabric in the arms has no give and it was challenging to reach for anything. While I loved the look of this dress is wasn't practical for moving around. This dress was also very short, I am only 5'6 and I had to be careful because it was that short. I knew that it was short when I rented it and honestly it didn't bother me that much since I didn't have to sit during the event. Maybe if I had sized up it wouldn't have been so bad but it would have been too loose around the waist and bust if I had. The part that really bothered me were the arms and I don't think sizing up would have made a significant difference.

It was still a bright color which is great for March. I wore a white jean jacket over it. I found that it fit true to size, somewhat tight in the bust. I am 5'2"" and it hit 2-3 inches above the knee. This is a great dress for shorter woman, I could see it being too short if you were taller. I would have given this 5 stars for fit but the shade of green wasn't my favorite, it looked more green than teal which is why I gave it a 4. I would still highly recommend.","March 26, 2018","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR100","Hannah","Very pretty, great quality!","Wore this to a fall outdoor wedding and it was perfect. The color is more of an emerald green than it appears in the model photo, it's also not nearly as short as it looks on the model (I'm also 5'3""). The fabric is sturdy, as is the lace/crochet overlay. I ordered the 2 and the 4, and the 2 was perfect- as someone with broader shoulders I was afraid my arms/should area would be too tight- the 2's arms actually fit the same, if not more loosely, than the size 4. The dress doesn't have a ton of give, so you certainly won't be able to raise your arms completely, but there is enough room for decent movement and dancing.","September 27, 2017","True to Size"

The dress did run smaller around the tops of the arms. I simply zipped the back up about three quarters of the way and then clasped it. You couldn't even tell and it alleviated the tightness. Lastly, I did wear shorts underneath as to not make a show for everyone as it is a bit short. Overall, I would suggest the piece and may even rent it again.","September 4, 2017","Wedding"

As most others stated, it runs small and the fabric provides little give for movement. It comes up a bit when you sit, also, so it was a bit awkward and I felt I was pulling it down a lot during the ceremony. I would say if you know you'll be standing a lot, it's a great dress. I had to cut out before the reception, but I imagine it would probably be difficult to dance in. I typically wear a 6-8 and the 8 fit only slightly snug and the 10 was way too big. Because of the layers and fabric, I was able to not wear a bra.","August 2, 2017","Small"

Like the other reviewers say, it's tight across shoulders so order a size up, so that's what I did. I got a 4 instead of a 2. I guess all the crossfit I do had bulked me more than I realized, as this fit loose everywhere except across the shoulders. I decided 3 hours for church was enough, I didn't really want to feel confined in this for a whole work day. I absolutely love the look and could see ordering this again for say, family photos. Pretty piece but a bit tight through shoulders.","July 30, 2017","Everyday"

The dress is beautiful and photographs well but it loses a star on comfort. I typically wear a size 4 or 6 and while I did wear the 6, the slip beneath the lace was a little too short - I was thankful to have a napkin covering my lap during the meal. The lace has no give so the sleeves do feel a bit tight. Sizing up 2 sizes might help but I worry that a looser fit along the body would be less flattering. It was great for the relatively short amount of time I wore it but not sure I'd want to spend more than a few hours wearing it.","July 21, 2017","Date"

The chest and style of the body part of the shirt is a straight cut, no flairing at the waist. So this shirt could be boxy, but it's your preference. The neckline with the long straps design, was awkward at first but then I realize that's the style of this shirt. I didn't tie it, just cross crossed the straps once and let it drape.

Good thing I loved it. It's a beautiful dress and the sequins are shiny on one side and a matted sparkle when they flip. It is stretchy so it hugged my curves well. It's a really thick dress so I wouldn't suggest it if you're going to an event where it'll be warm, but it was perfect for an early spring black tie affair. I think it was short but that's okay because the long sleeves and high neck balanced it perfectly. I'd rent it again.","March 23, 2019","Formal Affair"

I was surprised by how great the dress looked when I received it - sequins are a little bit of a gamble, after all. But it looked brand new, and I didn't lose any sequins while dancing, scooting in and out of cabs, etc. The dress definitely has some stretch - I could have easily worn a 6 if it'd been available. But overall, your natural size should work. The only two complaints I had were minor: (1) the sleeves were long on me (but I just cuffed them under so that they sat at my wrists), and (2) the lining feels a little cheap and heavy (but the only person who will know that is you!). Overall, definitely recommend for a fun night out!","January 3, 2018","True to Size"

My favorite part of this dress was actually the front. There is a small hook and eye to open this up for a low cut dress, for an evening look. I could see this as work attire, but open up the front and a fun happy hour look as well.

I was extremely restricted when tried to lift up my arms at all (i.e. couldn't even adjust hair). A small might have been better, but then I think around the stomach and chest it might have been a little large. The red color and details/cutouts really stand out with this one, but if you're looking for comfort at the same time this is not the right pick. I only wore for photos for about 15 minutes, and that was about my limit from a comfort perspective.","October 19, 2017","Small"

This top is made from top quality and the details are absolutely stunning. It does fit a bit small so I would recommend sizing up. Due to the details in the waist, you are able to see your skin but it isn't too revealing. I would recommend wearing a strapless bra or no bra since the panel on the chest can show your bra.

I would say ""movement"" would be just as ""constrictive"" as any body con or more fitted dress you would wear.

Loved the look and feel of it. Although after being out in the Vegas heat wearing this, the sequins did start to rub around my underarms, so if you plan on wearing this for 8+ hours, be wary of that. I got SO MANY compliments wearing this dress. Our company rented out an upscale Vegas night club for our USA Ball celebration, and the dress code was ""classy club attire"".

It says you can wear it with any standard bra, so iI thought the back was fully lined and just appeared backless, but that is not the case. Its just lace, so you need a backless bra which I luckily happened to have. I rented it for my work Holiday party and didn't think a backless dress was appropriate, so I was a little uncomfortable all night. Also, the description says its knee length on a 5'6 model, but I'm 5'7 and its definitely mid-thigh which was another issue for a work party. Lastly, it has a thin piece of plastic about 2 inches wide all the way around the hem I guess to give it some structure, but mine arrived creased so the dress laid really weird all night. Overall, it is a gorgeous dress but I wish the description had been more accurate ans I probably wouldnt have fotten it for this particular event.","December 21, 2017","Party"

I had planned on wearing the size 6, but because I didn't wear a bra, I sized down to the 4 in order to keep everything in place :) It was fitted but comfortable enough even to sit in. I took off one star because the bottom of this dress was strange - a stiff band along the bottom of the dress seemed to be warped, giving it an awkward shape.

A plus that I didn't expect to be a plus were the pockets. Pockets usually look horrific on me, but these were great and didn't poof out when I put the dress on.

Based on the last time I rented Katie May, I knew that I needed to size up and get the long length, and I'm glad I got both. I ended up wearing the 6L. The fabric of this dress had stretch and held me in in the right places. The only issue was that the give in the fabric made the dress ride up a little, so each time I stood, I had to readjust and shimmy the skirt down. When I first got the dress, I wasn't sure what the off-shoulder bit was supposed to do, whether it was supposed to just scrunch down or fold or what. I decided to neatly fold it halfway down and tack it in place so it wouldn't aggravate me the entire evening. I got so many compliments and my boyfriend loved it! I accessorized with sparkly earrings, no necklace, and it felt great! As much as I enjoyed this dress, I wouldn't rent it again--it ran way too short for my taste. RTR is awesome!!

It was a little difficult to zip up since the zipper is on the left but if you zip up first before putting Left arm in sleeve it's not so difficult. Also the off the shoulder piece was a little difficult to adjust on your own. Just a note there is a cut out in the back so no full body shape wear.","November 13, 2018","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KM4","Mali","Perfect blend of sophistication and sex appeal","This dress is a stunner. I felt amazingly sexy and sophisticated in this dress. However, it runs very small. I fluctuate between a 10 and a 12. I wore a 14, and even that was snug. But the way this dress hugs at the waist/hips, and the slight mermaid cut will do amazing things for your butt! The shoulder detail is slightly annoying. It just folds over, and it did not want to stay that way throughout the night, especially when we got to dancing. The back of this dress is gorgeous, however the cutout is pretty low. So I highly recommend a a backless bra. Also, if you were shapewear, they need to be seamless and short, otherwise they will show where the cutout is.","October 14, 2018","Formal Affair"

I read the reviews and ordered up. I got a 6R and an 8R. The material was good quality and thick; nice to hide any flaws. The size 6 was tiiiiiight in the hip area and I couldn't zip it up. Size 8, zipped up, was fitted in the hip area, but was so gappy in the boob/armpit area. And the band that goes around the shoulders was a little odd. I wasn't sure whether to fold it or keep it as is. As is, it came up almost to my neck. So I folded it, but it just wouldn't fold correctly all the way around. It was just awkward and awkward to dance around in. But all off the shoulder outfits are. The length was good. I wore 4"" heels with the dress and it was a perfect length. Overall, the dress worked and the boob gapping wasn't noticeable, but I won't rent this dress again.","September 26, 2018","Small"

Especially because on a different review a person said she was 5'10 and dress up was long enough to cover her feet.

For these reasons, I did have to purchase the appropriate under garments in order to wear this dress--something to consider for women who don't feel comfortable without wearing a bra.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NC71","RTR Customer","Runs big, wasn't clean on arrival.","This dress would be beautiful and have five stars, however I gave it four for 3 reasons: first, it smelled like the last wearer went to a crawfish boil and it hadn't gotten cleaned - it smelled terrible and was wrinkled. And second, because the dress didn't lay right, possibly because it hadn't been cleaned. 3. It's ever so slightly worn out, from over use probably. It also runs big - I'm a true 10 and could have worn an 8. I'm disappointed!! I may try to get the size 8 before my event in 5 days.","June 8, 2019","Party"

I am a 36D and felt very comfortable in it. This dress must be worn with a strapless bra. I am 5’9” and the dress was mid-thigh to knee length on me. This dress if perfect to go from day to night.

The dress was a bit long on me coming just past my knees but for a formal event, it was perfect. I have a wider back so the top was definitely a bit snug and I needed help to zip it but once I did it was fine. Since the top is a bit snug it forces you to have better posture too so that you don't get the dreaded armpit fat. I wish I owned this dress and I loved it so much!","January 31, 2019","Small"

It looked very nice and emphasized my rear in a very good way. It was quite large up top because I'm very small chested, but it fit basically fine with a stick on ""bra."" It should be obvious from the style that you can't wear any kind of real bra with this dress! The back really is quite open. One thing to note is that I don't believe this dress comes in ""long"" and the regular length was pretty short as you can see in the pictures. I am 5'7"" (erring on the side of 5'6""). Even if I had had flats on, the dress would have been off the ground. Don't get this dress if you are my height or taller and care about it being the right length.","September 3, 2019","True to Size"

The dress has vertical wiring in the chest to help hold it's shape, and is fully-lined, giving the dress a nice weight and helping you feel covered.

I think this runs small- I usually wear medium but had to size up to the large and it still felt a little tight. It does have the skirt underneath so it was tight around the legs and the rib cage. Didn’t have to wear a bra!!!! And didn’t have to worry about pulling it up all night. Stayed put pretty well. Love the cut of the dress, it was so unique and I was getting a lot of compliments on it.

I could get the Medium zipped, but I don't think I would've been comfortable wearing it all night. If you have a more petite build, your regular size would work better. Otherwise, I'd recommend sizing up. I really liked the hemline and the longer side was floor length on me at 5'5"".","April 6, 2018","Small"

I am pulling it open in the picture so you can see. I wear a 6 and could not even zip the small so this is the medium. I would have loved it if the fabric on the bust didn't kind of flap up. I have a small chest so I can't imagine what it would do on a large one. Also, this dress is long so I'm not sure than anyone under 5'5 could wear it without stepping on it and that's with high heels.

I'm 5'3"" and usually a size 2 or 4 in formal wear. I definitely consider myself an athletic built because I have curves BUT I usually never have a problem with smalls fitting me and this dress is definitely NOT made for women with curves. The small fit quite snug on my ribs and bust (I'm a 34B and tried to wear without a bra) and it fit my hips but it looked like it was pulling the fabric so I went up to a medium which was manageable at the bust but then to loose in the hips and the ruffle train was way to long even in 4 inch heels.

If you have the legs to rock it, then the dress is awesome. My legs are athletic and felt like I needed to frequently pull it down to keep from exposing myself.","November 28, 2018","True to Size"

I received so many compliments and on top of it looking amazing, it was very comfortable! I was able to wear a strapless bra without a problem. The photo on model makes it seem as though the dress get loser around the hips, but that was not the case for me. It was more fitted than I had expected, but still loved it. I paired the dress with RTR's White Pearl Earrings by Kennith Jay Lane and they really pulled the look together!","November 15, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RZ89","Mareesa","Perfect fit!","I've never ordered or tried on any RTR dress so I decided to go to the RTR Topanga location to see how they fit. I'm normally iffy about ordering dresses - especially fancy dresses online because they never fit my body shape well. I'm 5'4'', 112 lbs, and smaller on the bust/waist side so my problem area with picking a dress is always the chest area - sometimes its too big, doesn't look good even with a strapless bra, etc. So I needed a dress that wouldn't give me any problems of being too loose or weird fitting in the chest area. This dress was amazing and fit surprisingly well for a 0. I'm normally a 2 but they didn't have so I decided with the 0 and I'm glad I did because any bigger would be too loose. The material felt nice and not too heavy. There's an inside black satin slit that helped space the outside material from my skin so it ended being super comfy. The theme for the event was ""internet glam"" so the gold really helped make thing pop! Aside from the dress, the service at the store was amazing! Everyone was extremely helpful in assisting and recommending accessories. The return process was effortless and extremely efficient! My whole experience was so stress-free and I had an amazing night looking and feeling incredibly glamorous! Thank you!","November 8, 2018","True to Size"

It allowed a little skin to show through without being too revealing (for a formal work event). However, this dress fit me VERY tight, it was not comfortable and it had no give. I ordered the 12, because I wanted there to be a little breathing room - yet there was none. It fit like a second skin and is not for women that have large shoulders and and chest. I'm 36DD and there was NO room for breasts. Also, I am more apple shaped and have a slight belly pudge - this dress will not forgive that.

Pros- comfortable, beautiful color, beautiful lace, stands out in a crowd, sexy, shows off toned legs Cons- very low cut; I had to use safety pins in the front to keep from being exposed, hard to zip If you are tall like me, plan on not having to bend over or squat down if you drop something or you'll be showing some booty.","June 7, 2017","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM287","Erin","Cute but...","This is a super cute romper. Unfortunately, it's also super gappy in the chest area. I had to safety pin it shut. I am a 32D and it was hanging open in the front. For us short girls (5'3), it fits a little funny in the back. Fits fine in the waist, huge in the chest and then bunches in the back near the zipper. I would of probably worn something different if I would of brought something else, but this was my only option. Beautiful color. I was the first to wear this size 4 as it still had the tags on it, so it wasn't even that someone before me stretched it out. Rent with caution as it does fit weird.","June 3, 2017","Large"

I'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs, 32D and usually wear a size 0. The back is also lacy, so you really need a backless bra, or don't need one at all because the front is lined.

The material was really comfortable, and it offered a nice second button on the chest keyhole if you wanted to show more or less cleavage. The elastic waistline hit perfectly above the hips (again, flattering!). Going to the bathroom wasn't too cumbersome; I could manage the buttons in the back of the neck myself.

The fabric had a really nice feel to it, and it was perfect for that in-between season where it's a little chilly out but you don't want to haul around a jacket.

I got both size 2 and 0. I am 5'4 108 pounds and the size 0 was way to tight. The 2 fit a lot better. Very pretty cut and color! Is tight up top near chest area and mid section.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ89","RTR Customer","Simple cut and great color for fall","I rented this as my backup dress for a fall wedding. I had a tough time deciding between this and my first choice but ended up going with my original. I'm consistently a 4P in Banana/J. Crew and I rented the 4. It was a bit snug in the waist and I'd probably size up if renting again (more hope for eating/dancing). Even though I'm short, I thought the length was appropriate on me. You can't wear a bra with straps because of the cut of the neckline--so strapless of braless is the way to go. You could wear shapewear if desired but nothing with longer shorts because of the slit. The material is thick with a little give. Overall great simple on-trend dress in the perfect fall color.","October 14, 2018","Wedding"

I'm 5'4"" and was 36 and 37 weeks pregnant (140 pounds) when I wore it, and I don't think it would have been appropriate much past that-- a little too tight/revealing.","December 9, 2019","Everyday"

But after having it on and walking around, I barely even noticed it. Back was super sexy, be sure to wear pasties or your back strap will show.

Only con was the small straps used for hanging kept coming out in the back all night.","February 15, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID7","RTR Customer","Classy","The dress fit very well aside from it being a little too long. I spent much of the night holding it up even with four-inch heels on. I’m 5’7”. I wear about a 40C bra size and it fit my bust nicely. I didn’t have to wear a bra with the dress. It was a bit restrictive with the way the arms are made, and the little strings that hold it on the hanger kept popping out the whole night. Women kept taking it upon themselves to stick them back in or just inform me they were out. Overall, it was great for the price. I would suggest some sparkly jewelry to help spice it up.","February 10, 2019","True to Size"

I am an 8-10 in clothing but I wore a 14 in this dress. I am also busty with broad shoulders so it's difficult for me to find things that fit up top as well as my waist and this was no exception. It was a bit baggy in the waist but it's a dark color so it wasn't too noticeable. Overall, I would definitely recommend this dress.","January 14, 2019","Small"

I have a small chest but I'm tall so I usually have to size down for fit. The dress has a number of extra strings on it for hanging so it required sticky tape to hide them. It didn't work that well for me though and I had to have my husband do ""string checks"" throughout the night. The dress also sits a lot lower (chest wise) then I wanted. I'd give it 3.5 stars.","January 4, 2019","Wedding"

During the event I received several compliments and I referred everyone here. I had to size up as my chest is unusually large due to lung disease. Even still, the bodice was strong enough to hold shape while still being comfortable and did not squish my boobs too much. The waist was very loose on me; however, due to the amazing seam work on the gown, there was an illusion of a tiny waist! I've never looked so good.","December 5, 2018","True to Size"

I got lots of compliments, but I didn't love the fit of the dress. The cut across the front seemed odd on me and the underwire poked me all night. It was a tight squeeze but I made it work.

At the end of the night, the wire under the chest area popped out. Luckily it was when i was heading home. I wish the dress fit a little tighter on the hips.

I wanted to try it on anyways and it was elegant and fit perfectly. With 5 inch heels, this length worked. This would have been a perfect dress for the Marine ball. The only con would be that it is difficult to raise your arms up which I would imagine would make it difficult to dance. Otherwise I really loved it.","November 23, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID7","Erin","Glamorous Dress but Fits Large","This is an absolutely gorgeous dress but be warned - it fits large, especially if you have a small waist. For the sake of comparison, I am just a hair under 5' tall, 100 lbs, 32A, and pear-shaped. I rented the smallest size available (0R). With 4"" heels on the dress dragged on the ground a bit but it was only about 1/2"" too long. If you are taller than 5' you will have to wear shorter heels (and it might be too short entirely if you are taller than 5'4""). The fit was good in the hips, shoulders, and chest. However, it was HUGE in the waist/stomach. I seriously could have worn this as a maternity dress - there was that much room in the torso. Perhaps if you are built straight up and down instead of pear/curvy this will work better for you. I saved the look with a belt and ended up receiving a ton of compliments on the dress, but if I hadn't been able to order that belt online at the last minute I would have just looked baggy and sloppy instead of glamorous. The photo on the left is the dress with the emergency belt I bought, and the photo on the right is how the dress fit me without a belt - shapeless and baggy in the torso/waist.","November 12, 2018","Large"

On the pro side, the dress was surprisingly comfortable to wear. The shoulder straps stayed up even through dancing all night, and the built-in bra provides enough support/coverage. On the con side, it was not quite the best fit for me. I have an hourglass figure and the dress was too loose and column-like at my waist, and didn't hug my curves. It might be ether for someone with a more athletic or straight figure.","October 28, 2018","Wedding"

Put on a lot of weight this year, but along with spanx this dress doesn't show it (at least I don't think) I really liked that you can move the straps up or down depending on how sexy you want to look - it's really low cut if you move the straps closer to your elbows, or much more family-wedding appropriate if you move them closer to your shoulders. I'm 5'7 and in low heels the dress didn't quite hit the ground. Very comfortable too - this was a great rental!","October 19, 2018","True to Size"

The overall fit was perfect and was more comfortable than I expected. The hanger strings were annoying, but I had safety pins on hand to use to keep them from showing all night. The dress length was perfect for my shoes. I wore a heel that was about an inch and a half or maybe two inches high which were ideal. This was my first time using RTR and I could not be more pleased!

The other gowns I tried were very heavy and warm, but this gown was sleek and just stretchy enough t be especially flattering. Plus I love the color! Photos do not do justice to the brightness of the fuchsia. The floral pattern makes it easy to go out with minimal jewelry. However, I'm an A-cup and had to wear a slightly padded bra to get and ideal fit around the chest.","August 15, 2018","Wedding"

I was able to ware a basic strapless bra with it and have it not show which was another plus. However, I did order the long and I was disappointed that the dress was a little short even without heels.

I ended up choosing it for a black tie wedding and received so many compliments throughout the night. It was very comfortable, not too heavy, and just the perfect length for me with 3 inch heels.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM349","Meredith","Even more gorgeous in person","This was definitely a beautiful dress! It was just waayyy too long. I thought I would be okay since other girls who are maybe an inch taller than me said it was a perfect length in 3 inch heels... I wore my tallest heels (4 inch) but it was still really long. I made it work by kind of bunching up the skirt and holding it up when I walked. The fabric is nice and heavy. I did wear a strapless bra and spanx, just my personal comfort thing, but you definitely don't need to. Also, I ended up wearing the 2 instead of the 4 because the zipper didn't go all the way down in the 4 (like the side seam was sewn over the zipper and I had to call my neighbor to help me take it off over my head!) the 2 fit really nicely and wasn't too snug so it worked out. I would dock it a star because of the above, but it is a really beautiful dress, even more so in person, and it is unique. You will definitely stand out in this dress!","May 15, 2018","Formal Affair"

It drapes nicely and I don't think this is supposed to be a super tight fitted dress because there was still room for me around the chest and waist without looking baggy. Thank god I got the petit size- I am 5'3"" and wore flats to this wedding and it had just a nice drape on the ground without letting me feel like I was dragging.

Would absolutely rent again for the right occasion. Runs a bit long (I am 5'2"") and fit into the 2P but I also wear 5-6 inch heels with it so it worked out nicely for me. If you are shorter and are not wearing at least a 5"" heel, you might have a problem with the length, even with the petite size(s) so beware of that.

I wore a thick 4"" heel and it just barely skimmed the ground. I got a lot of compliments and it was very comfortable. The cut of the top is very flattering and the gown skims versus clings.

I live in Boston, and we were in the middle of a snow storm, so I was glad the dress had long sleeves and a mock neck. The material is a bit thicker as well, but not quite a sweater dress knit. The material is stretchy, which is good because it's quite tight. I'm pretty slender and had a hard time getting it over my shoulders and it was quite fitted on the arms. I'm often a 2 or xs in dresses, but I wore a small in this. I wish I had gotten the medium as my back up size, but the small fit well enough in the end.

One issue I ran into was wearing tights with this dress. As you can see in the picture, I pulled up the tights above the cutouts. I was disappointed I had to do this, but the dress fit quite snugly around my waist and was unflattering if I had kept the tights below the cutouts.

Things to be aware of: 1. the back is low. Wear a low cut bra in the back or no bra. I kept checking to make sure mine wasn't showing. 2. The ties at the wrists can be tiresome. I ended up looping them twice around my wrists and then putting them in a bow. They can be long. 3. Finally, the straight hem on the bottom can be awkward.

I was struggling with what to wear to my law school's ""semi-formal"" until I found the perfect balance between fun and sophisticated in this comfortable romper. Only drawbacks I can think of is that it does not at all hug your butt. So, if your looking to emphasize that area of your body, go with something else. Also, I can imagine it would run tight in the chest for anyone with a cup-size of a C and beyond. If you don't identify with either of these concerns, rent away!","February 10, 2017","True to Size"

It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra or no bra since there is an open back. At 5’10”, the length hit mid-thigh on me.

I am fairly small on top, but this dress made me look even pudgier than I am. It didn't do anything for my larger figure. And lastly, the top was a bit restricting in the arms.

I’m 5’0, 135lbs, 34DD and typically a 4 in dresses, but the 6 was so tight in the body and the lower sleeve/strap was cutting off circulation in my arms. The 8 fit perfectly, except the lower strap was still WAY too tight and the upper strap was now oddly floppy. I threw a pin on each sleeve in the back and it ended up working well. The dress is lightweight and was comfortable for an outdoor engagement party (WITH GIANT FANS) in the summer in south Florida.

You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra or since there is small keyhole in the front that may expose a typical strapless bra.

I'm glad I did, because my usual size 0 was TIGHT. I needed my husband's help to finish zipping it up over my rib cage, and I could hardly raise my arms once that was done. I think the 2 would probably have fit well and been very cute. I did feel that even in the 0 which was small on top, it was not very fitted in the hips and below, which is my preferred style... so probably the 2 would have been even more like an A-line and less like the figure-hugging silhouette I had hoped for. Honestly without having the 2 to try on though, I can't say for sure. I'd order the 2 as a backup option in the future, that's how much I love the look online... just not sure it will work for me!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS70","Michelle","You will feel glamorous and gorgeous in this dress - just get some double sided tape first!","Other than my wedding dress, I think this was the most glamorous I've ever felt. Loved everything about this - the fit, the cut, the show stopping back, and the functional pockets. I am large chested and managed without a bra - couldn't tell. But I did use a generous amount of boob tape. And as everyone said, the zipper is tough - it is definitely a two person job. But it's worth it.","June 19, 2019","Formal Affair"

I have a short torso so I had to pin the straps for being a little long which was tricky considering the open back. The waist band is a little tight too so I suggest sizing up but prepare some boob tape because the side can get gapey if you’re smaller chested.

I am petite and curvy - 5'3, 34D and usually wear between a 6 and an 8. This dress fit on the snug size (no way a 6 would've fit). You can't wear a bra with it, so a lot of fashion tape was needed (to avoid too much side boob) but the tape did the trick. My only issue with the dress is the zipper was difficult/near impossible to do up. Because I used RTR bridal service I was sent two of the same dress in my size. Thankfully this was the case a the first dress would not do up. The second one was fine and had no problems. This is definitely a fun occasion dress and was a nice confidence boost with all the compliments I received :)","June 11, 2018","Small"

But it still worked and I would definitely wear this dress again! If you are looking for a simple yet elegant feel as well as a little sass then this dress is for you!! :)","June 3, 2018","Wedding"

The bottom half of the dress is more of a cream if not beige color instead of an ivory white.

The material is quite thick which was good because it was a cold night.","April 21, 2018","True to Size"

Looks like sparkly leather in picture but it has a nice soft non stiff texture that moves really well. Loved the fact that it gave me a little cleavage which I never seem to have. I ordered size 4 and 6, and went with the 4. It is pretty true to size and the fit and flare works well for my pear shape. Sexy, fun, flattering dress!! My favorite rental so far!!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA251","Tara","Twist on a LBD","I wore this to a NYE party. It paired well with tights. It wasn't my first choice, but I was pleased with the dress when it arrived. The material is a little shiney, but it doesn't look cheap or low quality. It has a slight glimmer to it. I went with the 6 over the 4, because the 4 was a little too snug in the cinched part of the wait. It was more comfortable with the 6, though I could have powered through the 4 if I was really adamant about it. My only complaint is that the fabric has a texture to it, so, it rubbed a little bit in my armpit/under arm from dancing all night. If you have super sensitive skin, I would advise against this. However, if you don't get irritated as easily or aren't as big of a dancing machine, you will fair just as fine.","January 11, 2018","True to Size"

I'm 5'1, 120lbs, and I wore the 2. I almost felt like a 0 might work, but the waist may have been a little tight. The cutout back didn't lay perfectly flat since I had a little room in the chest so I chose to wear my hair half up to hide that a bit, but I was so comfortable in this all night! I received tons of compliments and you gotta love the pockets. This almost appears leather with the sparkle, but it was super soft fabric. My order arrived well in advance, but one zipper on my garment bag was broken so it was a challenge to carry this on the subway with me - otherwise the new bags are a huge improvement from the original plastic ones. Don't wait- rent this baby!!!","December 16, 2017","Party"

I am between an 8 and a 10 right now, I only had the 10. While a bit big on top, it is better than being too small. The material is beautiful and the cut is unusual without being whacky (and plunging but definitely can wear with a regular bra).

The belt is also great and comes separately. The pants could be an inch longer for my height but otherwise it is super fun. No pockets and it is unlined.

On yellow lighting it really shines and definitely will attract attention. It's also very easy to put on and off specially during toilet trips. I removed one star just because it runs large at the top, Literally if you bend over and your well endowed the girls will be seen so needed to put fashion tape on. Also it's quite memorable, so I think it can only be wore once. I loved the 80's vibe design of the top.","January 6, 2018","Large"

I am 5ft 51/2 inches and I wore about 4inch heels and the length was perfect. If I began to walk a little bit sometimes it would ride up but a quick shift and the dress would be put in place again. I recommend wearing this with sticky boobs, it helps give the top more shape. I would consider myself an athletic build and carry most of my extra weight in my lower stomach/thighs. That being said this dress did a fantastic job accentuating all of the right places. The fabric is durable and you don't feel suffocated at all.

I had read countless reviews which all said the same thing. Please believe us and you won't regret it. The off-the-shoulder straps stayed put all night. Also, very important to note for us short women: this dress is not too long if you wear high heels. I wore 4 inch heels and it grazed the floor.

The only downside was that it has 6 hanger loops that I had to secure with tape because they kept popping out no matter how good I thought I had hidden them. Shapewear was definitely needed, and the regular length with 3"" heels was perfect for my 5'3"" self. I felt so pretty in this dress and received a ton of compliments.

The color was gorgeous. Last time I checked, my measurements were 34-29-39 so I normally opt for size 6 but the 4 fit me perfectly even after eating all day and night. It's the right amount of sexy but appropriate for a wedding. I did wear a strapless bra underneath and it fit.

I wear a size ten in jeans, but generally run 6-8 in dresses due to my pear shape. The dress is stretchy, so went over my wider hips fine and then hugged my waist perfectly (the 8 backup size fit my hips but was too loose around the waist). The only complaint I have and why the dress got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the arm holes are smaller than they should be and I ended up chafing right above my armpits pretty badly from dancing for about 45 minutes. So if you have muscular arms or carry weight there it may not be the absolute perfect dress. Otherwise I highly recommend it!","April 28, 2019","Large"

Loved that I could tie it in different ways, although you need a sticky bra - I couldn't figure out a way to tie it that would allow for even a strapless bra. I ended up having to adjust the back several times through the night (fashion tape or a safety pin would have helped), and the large amount of fabric in the skirt meant I needed to hold it up to walk, but this dress was flattering, a gorgeous shade of navy, and bump-friendly! I wore the long (which I am never tall enough for!) because my bump pulled it up in the front and the regular looked too short. Would definitely rent this again!","May 21, 2019","True to Size"

I'm a size 12 and ordered the larger of the 2 sizes but the dress almost didn't fit. My back up size was the smaller of the 2 sizes and it looked like it would maybe fit a size 0-2.

I was worried about the lack of support for my chest but found that I was able to tie the dress and it gave me plenty of support. I did wear an adhesive bra but that was mostly to keep from having head lights all night. I am a size 6 not pregnant and my chest is probably a 34 E at the moment (possibly a bigger cup).

It flowed beautifully with high quality, thick fabric and a beautiful cut to the dress. I wore pasties with this dress in lieu of a bra and still felt like I had adequate support because of how I wrapped the top portion. I did not wear the sweater pictured during the ceremony but was happy to have it for the reception (November wedding). I'm 5'7"" and wore 1.5"" heels, I rented the long version as well but was happy with the length of the regular. I managed to keep it out of puddles all day but if I hadn't lifted it, it would have dragged on the ground. It had Old Hollywood vibes and I was able to wrap the back so it was not backless like the pictures on here suggest. I wanted more coverage and was able to get it!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TBD3","RTR Customer","Great Gala Dress","So I Was attending a gala. I needed a dress to fit the theme which was Arabian nights. I tried lots of different tying techniques and I totally recommend checking out some videos. Ultimately I went with the one shoulder look and lots of double-sided tape. I really do recommend having pasty's or bra, I did not. I am very small chested and the double-sided tape across my chest around my breasts pulled funny when I moved. It took a lot of work to make it smooth and flattering. If I'd had a bra or stickies it would've been a lot easier. I'm 5 foot 9 and the long was definitely long. There's a lot of fabric here and it's fun to move in but it takes a little practice. I don't recommend this dress, or at least this tie, if you're going to be dancing. The color was stunning. Great dress and perfect for my event.","November 2, 2018","Formal Affair"

It looked bulky up close and the multiwear straps added to the bulk, but it photographed well. I ordered the petite size since I'm 5'4"" and wasn't planning to wear heels, but if you have a pregnant belly I would recommend going with the longer size.

Though it would have been super easy to alter that at any point (think conservative in the Church, sexy at the reception). I tried it on at the store and I wore 3 1/2 heels (it IS long for those of us who are not tall. I didn't really find a way to shorten since the adjustable part is the top.

I loved the fit and how you could tie it many different ways. I wore this for a military ball so my husband wasn’t in a dress up mood to tie it 100 ways, but I think if you have a girlfriend around to play with it, this dress is that much better!

I am normally a 12 and I had to wear the 14 and that was still tight, solely because of the band. However, other than that, it was super light weight and comfortable. I did get a ton of compliments!","May 15, 2019","Small"

I am running a 14 these days and couldn't get the 14 zipped. The 16 was just right, except for the bust, which was way too loose. That's great for women with more curves!

I could definitely dance in it if needed (you can definitely move/lift the sleeved arm), the color was gorgeous, and it was super elegant. The only thing is the back has a cutout that didn't totally lay correctly, but it wasn't very noticeable. I'm between a 6 and an 8, and the 8 fit perfectly! I didn't wear a bra, and wore no show underwear, but I'm not sure how other undergarments might look, since you might be able to see some lines through the fabric (didn't try it with other things, so not sure).

Very flattering and boned waist nips you in a bit especially if you go down a size. The color was a tad bit more plum than just deep red, in my opinion.","May 22, 2019","Small"

I have a very wide rib cage and a muscular back, so the top did not leave room for a bra. That was fine because I have a small bust, but keep it in mind! The dress also blouses out by the pleats in the waist which wasn’t the most flattering, but that might just be how it fit me. I got tons of compliments wearing it, and I paired with a necklace from here too. I felt great, was comfortable, and loved being able to show off some fun shoes!

The 8 fit well but was tighter up top than the 10 so I went with the 10 to be a little bit more comfortable. throughout the night I had to pull up the top a few times which I probably wouldn't have had to do as much with the 8 but both would have worked well! This is SUCH a flattering, gorgeous dress. The back is pretty long though as I am 5'10 & was wearing about 2 inch heels & had to pick up the back to prevent it from being on the ground sometimes. So if you're shorter just know that it will probably be a little long! Overall I loved this dress and was so sad to have to send it back.","March 28, 2019","Formal Affair"

The top is generous, almost to the point of being too big (and I have a full bust). The hips and stomach were tighter than I normally wear, but the sales associate told me it ""fit beautifully"".

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW629","Maria-luisa","","I love this edgy dress by Slate & Willow! Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going down for your back-up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and at the hips. Curvier women should consider sizing up for fuller hips. It works best for A-C cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a strapless bra since the cut of the neckline will expose your bra straps. At 4’8”, the length hit knee length on me. The metallic leopard print gives this dress a fun edgy look. Pair with black stilettos to complete your outfit!","February 2, 2019","True to Size"

The dress contributed to my look of classy elegance, with girlish charm.","November 10, 2016","True to Size"

The photos do not do this dress justice, the gold lace is just exquisite. i was worried about the sleeves being too tight since i have bigger arms but they fit and I didnt feel restricted. At 5'8 this dress hit right at my knees. the scoop neck is a big scoop so i did have some tasteful cleavage. I would rent this again if I had an occasion!","May 6, 2016","True to Size"

I'm glad that I asked for a second size, as I typically wear a 12 but it was too tight in the shoulders/chest, as well as the arms. The 14 fit, but the sleeves were tight enough to be a challenge to raise your arms should you need to. I did receive many compliments on the dress throughout the night and the length was appropriate for the event, which at my heigh is a struggle at times.","May 3, 2016","Small"

The color was stunning in person and went really nicely with my hair color. This dress has a nice stretch to it. I expected it to chafe my underarms, but it didn’t. It felt very comfortable to dance in. I was happy that I was able to wear a strapless bra and suggest using some double-stick tape to make sure the bar doesn’t show. Because I’m so short, the hem hit me below the knee, but it worked to cover my Spanx shorts! I ordered the dress about 6 weeks before the event, which gave me a good amount of time to really work on my arm, shoulder, and upper back strength; these are all areas really accentuated by this dress. The Spanx took care of the rest! I was a little disappointed that the stitching that attached one of the “wings” to the back of the dress was torn, but it was easily fixed with a black safety pin. Aside from that, I did feel like I had to be extra careful to not snag the dress or sequins through the night.","March 7, 2019","True to Size"

As the body is mermaid style and fitted you could not lift dress to use bathroom, someone would need to zip and unzip every visit to the ladies. Not ideal.

You cannot walk into a room without turning heads because the color made this dress a definite statement piece. One of the things I like most about this dress is the cutout. It is elegant yet not revealing. This dress also hugged me in all the right places, and I don't say that about a lot of dresses. Since I have a petite body and am not the curviest gal, not a lot of ""tight"" dresses fit me well. BUT this dress is an exception (but it's probably because I wore a 0 and not a 2). So if you are curvier I would maybe size up. The only con I would say about this dress is the thigh part of the dress made it really hard to move around so I had to hike up my dress to walk.

Dress is great quality, fully lined and super flattering. Very fitted and narrow at the knees so dancing was a bit awkward, as were bathroom breaks, but I would still highly recommend it. Also, I was not able to wear a bra, which is usually a deal breaker for me, but the top was fully lined and very fitted so it really wasn't a problem.

I wore normal cut seamless underwear and didn't have any panty line since it is a quality fully lined dress.

This gown is almost exactly what previous reviewers have indicated. It definitely stands out among the usual gala black (I received compliments from friends and strangers and could feel people staring as we moved into the event ballroom for dinner); it's sexy without showing too much skin (I wore it without a bra but with laser-cut undies); it runs long (I had to use dress tape to be able to wear 3"" heels, and still the skirt trailed). The material also wrinkles easily (I spent awhile steaming the gown beforehand) and does not really stretch. While I was able to cha cha, salsa, and bachata easily (the bandleader dubbed my friend and me the best couple on the dancefloor!), I had to take a break to aerate my legs since the skirt/lining were so warm and was careful when walking so as not to trip. Yet I didn't want to dress down when I arrived home! The paint on the zipper pull was chipped, I found a long blonde strand of hair in the lining from the previous user, and the hangers were broken, but I will definitely return to RTR for my next event needs!","September 26, 2018","True to Size"

The color is a subtle pastel greenish-blue that worked well with my neutral-warm skintone. I ordered the 4 and 6 and went with the 4 (my usual size). It was tight but not uncomfortable, and I think the fitted look worked better for the dress style--the size 6 was gaping on the side/arm hole and bunching a bit in the front. The fabric is structured, fairly stretchy, and thick enough that I didn't need to wear a bra--which is good, because a non-backless bra would probably show a bit on the left arm hole, and you'd probably need it to be strapless on that side as well. Also, as mentioned, the fabric does have a slightly frayed look at the edges, but it doesn't look messy. It's shorter than I usually wear but still felt appropriate for a daytime family event. Overall, I loved this dress and may rent it again!","August 21, 2018","True to Size"

I rented for my daughter's baptism. The length, for me, and high neck were church appropriate. There's a little bit of stretch so it's easy to move in.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AQ2","RTR Customer","Cute and family/professional appropriate, but watch out for the fray!","I wore this dress for my law school graduation, so when I was originally dress shopping, I was looking for a dress that was simultaneously appropriate for my family and my professors as well as cute for my boyfriend and photos... this dress did exactly that! I got so many compliments and really wanted to keep it. This blue was a great spring color, not too flashy and gave me a pop of color—it may be slightly less blue than the model’s photo but still pretty accurate. I ordered the two and the four just in case, I ended up going with the two. I am 5’3 and 125 lbs with a 32c and while the 4 fit just fine, I liked where the 2 hit my legs better. My biggest issue is the fray with this dress. I don’t think this was shown in any of the photos very well, so I am including my own. The seams are not a clean seam— IT IS FRAYED! I initially freaked out when I opened the package thinking I received some worn out dress, but then realized it was on both and it was on purpose. I am not really a fan of the fray, but the fabric is so thick, a clean seam probably wouldn’t look as good...anyway, the fray cannot be seen unless you’re super close up, it’s just something to be aware of when you rent so you aren't caught off guard.

I was nervous it was going to be too short, but it worked out to be great! The ruffle that comes down from the waist was so flattering and covers all the right parts. The only surprise that you can't really see from the pics is that the seam edges are raw so it almost looks frayed when you first open your package, but it wasn't distracting to the overall design, and I still felt the quality was great. I got sooo many compliments. I would definitely consider renting this same dress again!","May 28, 2018","Wedding"

Super thick material that hid flaws and made it okay to go braless. It does run small though, I typically wear a 2 and had the 4 been available as a back up size, I probably would have worn it. It was super short, in a good way! And the intentionally frayed edges help make it a little more causal.

It was sophisticated and fun to wear for a Derby party at a charitable fundraiser event. It was comfortable, the material is structured but still has a little give. I originally ordered two sizes but the smaller one wasn't available and I ended up only getting the 6. For reference, I usually am a 4 but sometimes a 2 if the hip isn't fitted. I didn't have a 4 or 2 to try on this time but the 6 fit almost perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised with the fit as sometimes shift/straight dresses don't fit my booty but it fit well! I got lots of compliments.","May 9, 2018","Small"

I usually wear a size 8, and when my size medium & backup size large arrived, they were both too big. RTR customer service was fantastic, overnighting the size small to my Airbnb so I had a dress for the wedding I was attending. I think the issue I had with the fit was because I'm petite. The tie at the neck has to be pulled from front and back at the right place for the front to lay flat, but I didn't like how low it cut on the sides. Probably non-issue for taller people.","January 20, 2020","Wedding"

Since it is not meant to be snug, and it sort of drapes over your body, it looked better wearing the XS than the S (the S made me look a little wider than I actually am). Additionally, you can adjust the tie of the bow, which gives you more of a custom fit for whatever dress size you choose. I loved the bow detail, which takes the dress from an ordinary wear to something with a little extra. I did get a lot of compliments on the dress, and I loved the rustic orange/pink color that it wound up being (went well with my olive-toned skin).

I got a lot of attention in this dress, from men and women and my boyfriend loved it. I might have chosen a different dress had I known the venue (It was a surprise), but I was able to use Bobby pins to keep everything in place up top and hide the dress length under a napkin.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM574","Holly","Fun dress, so many compliments!","A size ten was worn in this dress, it was slightly too loose in the chest, and fit beautifully from the natural waist down. The dress itself (in total length) is on the longer side( so I had some bunching in the waist and the v neck would migrate, so a strapless bra had to be worn but you could get away with a regular bra. The fabric has no give, so sitting down was a very precise art but it made you remember good posture. 100% would wear again despite the cons I encountered.","November 8, 2019","Wedding"

Running true to size, we would recommend getting your usual size as your primary and going one size up for the backup size. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and the stretchy material allows comfortable room for full hips. This dress is great for any cup sizes and may be worn with a standard bra. In regards to length, it hits me right at the knee. I love the ruffle detailing on this dress as well as the v neck cut, as it is super flattering. Pair it with black or sparkly heels to give it some flair and maybe a fun pair of statement earrings.","January 18, 2019","True to Size"

It wouldn't have stayed up on the side and I feared an inevitable ""oh, there's my boob"" malfunction at some point. I may try the XXS. If you have a bigger chest it shouldn't be an issue. This was long enough for my long torso--another thing I wasn't sure about the XXS, but I think it's for someone with longer legs than I. Still recommend!

The asymetrical hem line in playful and fun and spices up the LBD, but I didn't feel it was quite formal enough for the black tie wedding I was attending.

The color is more blue than it appears in the photos and it's lightweight but has a solid structure all at the same time. I got so many compliments throughout the night and it was very comfortable. I opted to wear it without a bra. The only thing to note is that it's very tight right below the boobs on the upper rib cage and there's no give. It worked, but I was a tad worried it looked too tight. Probably could have opted for a size up to have it a bit looser there, but I still loved it. Definitely recommend.

The 10 fit perfectly and the 12 looked a little big so I brought that with in case I spilled coffee of something. It was perfect!

Thinking about buying this timeless style! One word of advice: You do need to watch your sleeves if you are eating dinner.

A lot of reviews said it was difficult to walk in but I didn't think it was that inconvenient, just lift the bottom a bit. For length, I'm 5'11.5 and the Long just touched the floor when I was barefoot.

I am usually a 0 and I ordered a 2 and it fit perfectly. If I got a 0 it would've been wayyy to tight. The dress is very classy & flattered my body nicely, but it was hard to walk in the dress because there is no slit on the side and the materials thick. So if you are planning a night of dancing, walking,etc and want to be comfortable this probably isn't the best choice (just a btw) :) but over all I loved my experience with RTR & the dress !!","May 1, 2019","Formal Affair"

If you're at all worried about your stomach, I'd skip this one. The light color is unforgiving. As other reviewers said, the fabric is pretty thick and the skirt is very narrow. As long as you're not trying to do splits, you should be fine to dance. The color really is a light blue, but the blue doesn't come across in pictures very well, unless you are next to something white – luckily that means if you are going to wear this to a wedding, you really won't look like you're wearing white next to the bride!","September 26, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ110","Kara","Fun Gown","Rented this dress for a formal summer wedding. As others have mentioned, there is no slit so even walking is kind of tough. I was holding it up most of the night. Also, the fabric is REALLY thick. Needless to say in Texas it was 100+ degrees and I never shy away from the dance floor so if you're like me and love to dance, this might not be the the best dress. It was like a furnace under the dress! I originally tried wearing a strapless bra for extra support, but it showed in the cutouts so I went braless. The dress is pretty well made so this was not an issue. The fit is a little tighter up top. I even tried on my backup size to see if it wasn't as tight, but the 10 was HUGE on the bottom so went with the 8. Personally I don't think I would rent it again just because I didn't like how hard it was to walk without a slit. I am 5'6"" and I wore about 3 inch heels the length was perfect.","July 25, 2018","True to Size"

I got a 4L (& 6L as my back-up based on the other reviews about small size). The 4L fit great (it was a little too long so used a couple of stitches to tack the hem up). the 6 was OK, but a bit big. 2 probably would have been too small. Soft, nice material. The only issue was what everyone else mentioned that it could have used a slit to make walking easier. I found myself just hiking it up a lot when I was walking to be able to take half-way normal strides. But I loved it. Standing still it was amazing. I would definitely get it again.","April 24, 2018","Small"

I'm glad I did because the 6L fit great! The length was perfect. I'm 5'10 and wore flats, and it was plenty long enough. The only cons were that it's kind of difficult to walk around in since it is so narrow and there is no slit in the dress. I kept having to pick it up to walk. Also, this dress looks much better with Spanx, no matter how thin you are. However, where the cut outs are is right above the top of the Spanx. So it creates more of a muffin too than you actually have. I went without them due to that reason. Altogether, it's a gorgeous dress with a lovely color.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP28","Alisha","""You look absolutely smashing, darling!""","""Your outfit! This whole look! That is it, you win...Over everyone at this festival-you win, honey."" ""I love your outfit! You look so happy!"" ""Hey! You with the lemons! I like the look!"" -A few of the actual complements I received (though nearly a dozen were submitted). I paired with the lemon earrings from Kenneth Lane on here, it elevated the romper to a complete look- it wasn't too over the top, but if you have reservations you just gotta own it. Though I can see what some others mean about buttoning the straps by one's self, the romper fit true to size on me. The straps attach to the back romper using a button, no clips, and there are three different button holes on the length of the straps to choose from. You can wear the straps criss-crossed or straight down--I checked it out on the website of Fame & Partners, the makers of the romper, and they depicted the straps used in these two ways. I will say that I personally had no troubles buttoning the straps to the romper by myself, but I do have abnormally long arms, so it is likely that you will need assistance with this part. Lastly for the fit, I have a long torso, I can count on one hand the amount of rompers that fit my proportions, and this romper fit like a dream due to the adjustible strap length! Also, this baby has pockets!!! I was able to dance (and dance hard) carrying my own things without having to get cought up in a purse, what a relief!

So definitely make sure you order a size up from your usual. It runs very short and is very tight and fitted throughout the whole thing. the shorts lining is very tight too. It works for any cup size but you have to wear no bra or a NuBra because of the super cute open back. At 5'3 the length hit very mini length on me, so tall girls be careful. This looks so cute with a simple low heel, the romper does all the talking!","May 15, 2018","Small"

I loved the print and wanted to wear it, but the biggest thing for me was the straps. It has 3 lengths you can adjust to with a button, but even on the shortest length, one shoulder kept sliding off.

I didn't have any problems with the height of the straps, it fit perfectly and stayed situated all day.

I have a long torso and pretty flat booty, so jumpsuits either give me a constant wedgie or are just super unflattering. However, this jumpsuit fit like it was made for me!!! It was so comfortable and gorgeous on. I felt so sexy and fierce wearing it! I wanted a fun new outfit to wear for Valentine's Day to surprise my fiancé.

Agree with others that it ran big on the top/straps, but I didn't have any issues with slipping straps and I am a pretty small-busted person. Went with the larger size (6) since it looked just as form-fitting as the 4, and so I went with comfort.

As others have noted, the straps were WAY too long, but a few safety pins did the trick. It was easy to get on and off by myself, and was just the right length, although again, I'm only 5'1.

The chest area is tight, so if you have a larger chest, so may have to size up. Because of that, you don't quite have full range of motion in your arms. Also, be prepared to have wrinkles at the end of the night if you're sitting a lot due to the silk. Even with these two caveats, I would still recommend.","October 6, 2017","Other"

About a week before the wedding I got an email saying I'll be receiving this dress. After reading some of the reviews, I was pretty hesitant and scared it wouldn't look nice. The comments said it wrinkled easily, the lace part was itchy, and it didn't supposedly compliment short people. Also I was afraid it would be too hot for a wedding in Bakersfield, CA, but I was wrong. It was perfect for the weather and event. I have to say most of those comments were the total opposite of what I experienced! The only thing that I would have to admit was the lace part was a little itchy at first (I think the comments got to my head), but as the night went on, I didn't even notice it anymore. To keep the wrinkles at bay, I actually used a steamer to take out the wrinkles the night before and about 30 mins before I put it on. It worked perfectly! And I honestly didn't wanna wear heels to the wedding since it was outside, but I did for the ceremony then wore my Nike Rose Gold Cortez for the dancing portion (since it matched) and it was PERFECT. The length didn't other me at all. It was about 2-3 inches past my knee and fit great! Overall, I was very happy and pleased with this dress despite all the negative comments about it :)","September 27, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN62","RTR Customer","Great dress, minor flaws","This dress was perfect for a day wedding. I got lots of compliments on it. They didn't have a size 2 so I ordered both a 0 and a 4 and both fit well, I just ended up wearing the 4 because it gave me a little more wiggle room. You will need nude underwear and like the other reviews say, it does wrinkle really easily but it doesn't detract too much from the dress.","September 23, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN62","RTR Customer","Gorgeous! Just not that comfortable.","It was gorgeous! I received compliments on it throughout the night. I'm also 5'9"" and the length was great for me. However DEFINITELY tight at the top. Hard to move and dance. The size up was way too large in the stomach / hip area. It also wrinkled very easily. It was already a wrinkly mess before I arrived to the wedding just from sitting in the car for 10 minutes.","September 19, 2017","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN62","RTR Customer","The perfect look for an old-Hollywood themed wedding.","This dress was stunning and I got compliments all night. HOWEVER, it runs very long. The model in the picture must be around 5'10 because on me, the dress went to my shins which made it appear frumpy and matronly, which is not a good look. I was so disappointed I attempted to find another dress at the RTR store in SF, but ultimately stuck with it because it really is beautiful. The picture you see here was after I used hemming tape to lift the hem around 5 inches. While this worked, I was paranoid all night that the tape would unstick, or I'd damage the dress unintentionally. I wouldn't recommend renting this if you're on the short side, it just wasn't worth the stress.","September 14, 2017","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN62","Erin","PURE CLASS.","My sister and I both rented these dresses from RTR & they were both unbelievable beautiful. I rented the blush colored dress & loved the thin material it was made of, and the detailing on the neck portion was amazing - so many compliments on the dress. The only down fall was that it can become easily wrinkled when sitting down, but i thought that was a small price to pay for this dress. I would definitely recommend this dress to anyone who was considering it. The dress is timeless and never out of style.","September 1, 2017","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN62","Malia","Tons of compliments!","Adorable dress! Super comfortable and soft fabric. Great length too- not too sexy for a wedding but also no mother-of-the-bride vibes! The only negative was that it was super tight in the chest and my chest isn't even all that big (34C). The bigger dress size fit my chest better, but then was awkwardly baggy in the hips making me look 10 pounds heavier. So I went with the smaller size and just squeezed everything in up top.","August 19, 2017","True to Size"

It was pretty comfortable for such a fitted dress, even if I couldn't quite take a full breath (the middle band doesn't have much stretch - this also made the zipper stick going up). I was able to wear a racerback bra easily and had no panty line issues. The modest knee length gave balance to the high slit.

I normally need a size 0, but the size 2 fit perfectly. The length was right under the knee as expected, and I'm just under 5'4. The dress was comfortable all night, including during dancing.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA286","RTR Customer","Classy and sexy, but too small.","Didn't wear this because the band around the waist was too tight and not flattering. I had already sized up (usually wear a 6 and this was an 8) but it still was tight enough at the waist to not be flattering. I plan to rent this again in a 10. The fabric was high quality, but not what I was expecting.

The asymmetry and quality of the dress were my favorite characteristics. The piece that goes across the back is elastic which is good because it has give but bad because it dug into my flesh a bit, creating some undesired rolls. I wore the dress to an awards banquet with some colleagues. The dress was actually sexier and more formal than I expected but it's better to be over-dressed than under-dressed!

The cut out is very sexy without being over the top. I wore this dress with a regular strapless bra. I'm not used to wearing dressing with such a high slit, but it was only uncomfortable when I was sitting down (so I just placed my napkin on my lap!).

The top fit perfectly and is thick enough to be worn with or without a bra. The slit doesn't come so high that you feel uncomfortable when sitting, but is enough to add some sexiness. The cutout is fun and didn't make my side pudge out which was a concern depending on the tightness of the dress. A fun and flirty alternative to your standard LBD.

The fit overall was wonderful. Tons of room! While it is form fitting theres still some stretch so it wasn't bad after the sit down dinner. You will have a few scratches under your arms at the end of the evening since its all sequins, but its worth it as the fabric is so well crafted. Wish this came in other colors for sure!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA139","Monica","Beautiful Gold Dress for being 6 months pregnant!!","This dress surprisingly fit well for my 6 month pregnant self. It was very stretchy and comfortable for the most part. I ordered the 10 & 12 and I ended up wearing the 10. They both fit but the 10 was more fitted. However, the beads did bother me under my arms. It felt scratchy throughout the night. It also was a bit loose on the top even though the rest fit great. I think a good push up bra would have worked that out. There's no need to wear a thong either because you can't see any underwear lines. Overall, the dress was a hit and I wore the petite and it showed my feet a bit. Enough to show off the front of my shoe. My heels weren't that tall since I'm pregnant and wanted to be comfortable. Plus I didn't want to trip either. If I weren't pregnant, I think the regular size would have been fine too but definitely hidden my feet. I think this dress is great for pregnant women.","January 28, 2019","Wedding"

The 8L was the perfect length--whether barefoot or in 4"" heels--and hugged all my curves without being suffocating. Dress was forgiving and comfortable; no special undies or Spanx needed. Sequins were a little irritating under the arms but not enough to ruin the experience. I did order the 10L as backup and another dress just in case, but after putting on this one, I fell instantly in love and didn't try on either of the others. Oh, and the dresses arrived a day earlier than expected! SUPER THRILLED with my first RTR experience and can't wait for an excuse to rent here again!","January 20, 2019","Formal Affair"

I dress up each year for this party and was told that my dress did not disappoint! I wore the 4R, which is my normal size. I did not have any length issues, being 5'5"" it was perfect to wear with a sensible heel. The fabric was not heavy as one might expect with a fully sequined gown, nor was it itchy where your skin rubs the outside of the gown. It has some stretch to it so just about any body type can make this dress work! You also can wear minimal jewelry, possibly a nice pair of earrings, and you'll be good to go. The gown wow's enough itself to not need a whole lot of extra accessories. All in all, this was one of my favorite rentals I've ever had from RTR!","December 17, 2018","Party"

Very form fitting yet still stretchy enough to be comfortable. The dress is showing some signs of wear (loose threads, missing sequins) but not noticeable unless you're wearing it. The sequins under the arm weren't scratchy at all. I received compliments all night long and the best part is that I felt amazing in it. Would probably rent again even though the wear in the dress is a concern.","March 11, 2020","Formal Affair"

It fit like a glove. I didn't wear a bra with this - it zipped up snug enough i didn't feel it was necessary. I don't think I could have worn the medium the next week but it was perfect & comfortable at that time. The lining is a soft stretchy cotton. slightly annoying: the zipper is hard to pull up (get help) & the arm sequins would stick to the bodice sequins.","March 7, 2020","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP28","RTR Customer","The compliments were endless","This dress was wonderful. It's stylish, comfortable and a show stopper. My only complaint was that the sleeve is very tight. I don't have large arms but I did have a moment when putting on the dress that I didn't think it would fit over my upper arm. I probably could have worn a XS if it wasn't for the sleeve. So if you have larger arms, I do not recommend. I'm a size 6, 5'5"" and 140lbs and ended up wearing the S. The dress is also starting to show some signs of wear that were noticeable up front but not from a distance. Overall, I was very satisfied with this dress.","March 4, 2020","True to Size"

The arms were tight also. I had to wear spanx for sure. The dress is beautiful. Not as bright as the picture looks. I would have absolutely loved the dress if I would have sized up to a Medium.

We did a lot of fun poses so the dress def. gives some good give and stretch. I loved the ombre and and the sequin wasn't overly shiny. This is a bodycon dress so while the dress hugs the curls it also shows any rolls if they are there so get some good shapewear.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP28","Delia","My first experience with RTR. It was great and I've been recommending it to people frequently.","Dresses arrived on time. In my opinion, this dress seemed to run a little small. Probably because the style is very form fitting, so running small makes sense. Just as a note for others who wear this dress, there is a zipper on the sleeveless side! Don't get so excited to try it on that you fail to look for a zipper, get stuck trying to pull the dress over your head, then have to have your husband help pull it on. Also don't reverse this process, panic that you'll be stuck in the dress forever (but you'd look really good) then find the zipper only after you've gotten the dress off...don't do this, that would be silly. It was really the one sleeve that had me wearing the size S over the XS (especially after I found the zipper). I don't have very big arms, but the sleeve fit was snug, there's not a lot of give in the sleeve. The rest of the dress was pretty comfy. There's a good slip inside and it's mostly elastic so it keeps things in place. I went without a bra. The dress is thick enough and the sequins provide enough texture to cover any pointy nipples. At first there was a little bit of rubbing on the edges under my arm and across my chest, but I stopped noticing it pretty quickly. A few pokes and rubs are to be expected with sequins. Sorry for the poor quality photo; I had a fun night and only took the one picture. I was kind of sad to return the dress, it made me look damn good.","February 8, 2019","Small"

I had no idea what to expect and since it's after Labor Day I decided to try rent the runway. After first trying to navigate the site and figuring out how to do it, i quickly picked a dress for the event I had no idea what to expect. I thought I picked two sizes, but after the confirmation email I realized only one size was being sent to me. After reading all the comments about the dress being so small I freaked out to say it nicely. I had no options for back up and prayed for the best. I ran home the day it was delivered... and it fit like a glove. I felt glamorous, it was comfortable, and although short.. not too short while standing. I loved that it was not see through, really any color undergarments would work with this dress. The material was comfortable and I was in the dress from 5 pm until 1 am. I will def look to wear this dress to an event again. Loved it.","October 19, 2018","Party"

Apparently, I should've ordered a 10 or 12 because the 8 was still too small. I was able to get it zipped and over my arms with no problems, but it was very short and the zipper puckered all the way down my butt. And it hugged every lump and curve to a fault. It wasn't cute on me. The dress seems to be well made, and I love the style. I just wish it had fit. Fortunately, this was a backup style provided by RTR free of charge as a promo, and I ended up wearing the other style I received. I would have been incredibly disappointed if this was the only dress/style I had ordered because I wouldn't have had anything to wear.","May 16, 2018","Small"

The fabric looks and feels high quality, and the dress is well-made. The neckline is definitely 'plunging' although the lace and sheer dark overlay do a good job of making the overall impression that is tasteful. I have broader shoulders and no cleavage to speak of, but I think that it would still look nice on someone with a larger chest. I've got arm muscles and broader shoulders, and unlike many dresses, the sheer fabric around the arms/armpits didn't chafe or bother me. The length was longer than pictured, and balanced out the top perfectly. The dress was structured but still allowed me to dance.

Also, the low cut V, I wore a black stick on bra and you can see the clasp in the front so I used fashion tape near my neckline to make sure the dress wouldn't move. That worked.

The dress does have a little give which was nice because my hips are wider than most size 4s. The sheer part looks SO CUTE in person and in photos. I didn't wear a bra because I'm pretty flat-chested and even though it has darts in it, it still fit pretty well. It would be pretty hard to wear a bra because of the deep V in the sheer front but maybe some of those gel bra cups would work? The only issue I had was that the slip inside the dress rode up and I didn't even notice - but I had had two bottles of champagne and was dancing a lot so that might be a user error.

It would be easy to dress up and wear with heels, or, because of the length, its super in flats as well! I saw other reviewers mention the ""loose fit"". For me it was true to size. There is lovely pleating right over the stomach that gives you a little grace. It's again over the back, presumably for the bum, but for me the pleats hit at my mid-back... The dress is shorter, but not obscene, however, if you have a larger bum, like I do (it's a bit of a bubble but) beware that if it doesn't line up with the pleats, you may not want to bend over in the dress. I certainly could not, however the dress was so stinking cute in every other way, I just made it work - and if your bottom isn't sizable (depth wise, not width wise) - this will not be an issue for you at all! 100% renting this one again.

I sized up (1-2 sizes) since I'm 31 weeks pregnant (133lbs) and it just fit my bump. Not stretchy at all so I got lucky and it was a little loose in the back near the shoulders but it worked.

The long sleeves were perfect for a semi-outdoor affair in the early evening. The dress material isn't lined so you do need to be cognizant of undergarments as it's easy for lines to show through. It's a thicker material though - perfect for fall/winter! I really liked the way it fit and felt it was a flattering look. I loved, loved, loved the color!

I did wear a black cami under it as it is cut a little low and I'm a 32DDD. Going to the bathroom was easier than others made it seem...

The elastic waste band was not at all too tie or in an awkward place, like some romper a can be. True to size; the button front is accommodating and comfortable for even a larger bust (I'm a D).

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CV39","Gables girl","Comfortable, Casual, and Slightly Sexy","This romper is a great choice if you're looking for something casual that still stands out in a crowd. The short length shows off your legs. The button up top can be left open a little to show some skin or closed for a more modest look. The black lace overlay is unique and makes this outfit a little edgy. The button up back allows the romper to be pulled up and down easily....I find some rompers to be very challenging. For me, the romper runs large. I usually wear a size 10 or 12 depending on how much room there is in the bust, the medium was plenty big for me (36DD). I wore a normal black bra (not strapless) despite the lace upper, and I don't feel the bra straps were noticeable. I paired it with gold jewelry and high wedge flip flops. It was perfect for a casual night time event at the Miami Zoo.","May 8, 2016","Other"

Cute details- got so many compliments!","I ordered the medium and large, thinking I would probably wear the large (first time using RTR). When I got the rompers, I tried on the large and it looked okay- but it was a little baggy and the shorts seemed pretty long and unflattering. I was a little worried but tried on the medium and it fit perfect! The shorts were a good length for a NYE party- I probably would not have wanted that length for a family party. Also I read a lot of comments about people safety pinning the top- I did not have any problems with it. It was a little low cut, but again cute for a NYE party. I got so many compliments on this outfit! The only issue that I had with this was the back was buttons. So about 5 buttons down the back, this made going to the bathroom a process, which was a little annoying on NYE when were drinking. But I wore a blazer over because it is sleeveless- so most of the time I had the middle buttons undone for quick bathroom breaks. Overall I loved this romper and would recommend!","January 6, 2016","Large"

The fit is my biggest issue with it: it was quite lose on the top but much tighter (and shorter) on the bottom, so I could imagine that it would tend to look pretty inappropriate for anything other than a lingerie-inspired party.","December 28, 2015","True to Size"

The 8 well in the hips, but was baggy in the top (I have a small chest)- the strapless bra I wanted to wear looked funny against the material, so I wore pasties instead, and went with the size 6. The size 6 was somewhat snug in the hips and chest, but not uncomfortable and still flattering.

The arms were a little tight like most reviews said but it wasnt problematic at all. I do believe the arms wouldve been perfect in the size 4.

I went to a Sunday brunch wedding and it was perfect: classic with an exciting twist. The fabric is light which made the longer sleeves a non issue in 75°+ weather. There isn't any give/stretch to this fabric so it was difficult to get off (mostly in the shoulders) but only when I was taking it off or trying to zip it. It fits loosely which is great for any kind of bloating (or just eating in general) and is pretty true to size. If you're flip flopping between sizes, go a size up.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AX53","Jordana","Stylist Review","Ruffles Galore!! This style was so fun and different, it ran true to size and I would reccomend sizing one size down for your backup size. It is fitted at the bust so I would recommend this style for anyone sizes A-C. The shape of this dress was not fitted, it was not fitted in the hips and the fabric did not have a lot of stretch. You can 100% wear it with a regular bra, spans or shape wear would be with ensuring no lines are seen through the fabric, but seamless panties would work as well! The fabric has some stretch to it, the best body types for this style are Apple, Hourglass, Athletic, Petite, Straight & Narrow. I would wear this style on a date, an evening work event, or formal brunch. In the winter I would pair it with dark accessories, grey, black or dark purple. In the spring I would stick to nude tones, rose gold and cream accessories. I would also recommend simple jewelry, no major statement pieces as the ruffles are certainly the focal point of this style.","February 14, 2017","True to Size"

I am between a 4 or 6 depending on dress style/ brand. Another tip is make sure your Spanx is completely seamless! I had to buy a new one because every detail of my spanx showed.

So, I have more to love in my mid-section, but the material was thick and stretchy enough I didn't have to squeeze into Spanx. I wore 2-3 inch heels, which worked perfectly with the 42 L. The dress hit before the end of the heels, so no tripping potential. That was a major plus because I'm clumsy as can be! :) I'm not busty at all, but the dress was still flattering with the fun cut-outs. The bright pink color was too much fun, and it even worked well with me being pale and too lazy to get a spray tan. I wore this to cover the CMA Awards in Nashville.

The top was not great for a smaller chest (34B). While it fit around the top tightly, there was WAY too much fabric in the chest area.

Only issue I had was that Im typically a small, but the small in this dress was way too tight. The medium fit well, but was a little loose in the chest.

I am 5'9"" and wore 3"" heels so you need to be in the taller side for this dress. It was right at mid calf for me. The slits make it fun and easy to move in! I would say the fit is true to size. I usually wear a 4-6 and wore the medium. It did slightly stretch as the day went on, but I wore the dress for over 12 hours. The stretch wasn't bad. It just went from slightly tight to comfortable fit around the bust. Definitely would rent again!","June 25, 2018","True to Size"

For reference I'm 5'7 130ish 32d. I'm normally between a S and M and I ended up wearing the M. The S wouldn't zip at my chest. I wore with a bra but that was for comfort, if you have a smaller chest you wouldn't need a bra. Highly recommend this dress, wish I owned it!!","June 3, 2018","Wedding"

I was super bummed last minute the original style i ordered couldn't be mailed to me because it wasn't returned in good condition. So my back up became my main choice. I was upset until I put on this dress. It really was so stunning and the navy was beautiful. It was also awesome not wearing a bra. I have gained some weight recently so it was a little tight but that was on me and not knowing my size","October 2, 2019","Wedding"

I was pleasantly surprised at how it looked on! Based on the pictures and reviews it's very hard to tell. I have a very small bust and basically no hips so it's very easy for flowy dresses to look like trash bags on me with no shape. Despite the flowy-ness of this dress it actually gave me some shape and fit like a dream! I could have ordered the long, but the regular worked just fine too.","September 19, 2019","True to Size"

Otherwise, comfortable","I normally wear a 6-8 but I had to wear a 10 (after trying on a 8 first) just to get this zipped above my breast area. After getting it zipped, I noticed two things: 1) the straps were way too big which meant it didn't hold up as nicely as I'd like and 2) there was way more cleavage than I'm normally comfortable showing. Overall, I'd suggest this for people who either don't have a large chest area or for those who do and want to show cleavage, but if you do, size up. Also, I recommend pairing it with fun shoes and fun earrings -- I did gold studded shoes and blue/gold tie dye hoops","September 4, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/WTS4","Amber","So many compliments!","Wasn't sure if I'd need the 4 or the 2, so glad I had the 2 because the 4 was too sloppy in the rib cage/waist. Was a little long for my 5'4"" frame, but it didn't interfere with dancing at all! The slit isn't noticeable if standing, but gives comfort while sitting and walking. Would definitely rent again. Only downfall is I wish the straps adjusted-even on the 2 I felt like they wouldn't stay on my shoulders. Even with fluctuating bust size due to nursing, there was lots of wiggle room in the padding. And the lining was very helpful to prevent any nipples from showing through. Just not a good MAH look (;","August 26, 2019","Wedding"

I'd read the reviews in advance and knew to bring a little sewing kit. When I got the dress, it was very snug around the hips but the straps were falling off my shoulders. Maybe I'm just a terrible seamstress, but I never managed to shorten them appropriately: the straps are so thin that they dug into my shoulders while still managing to fall off half the time. So while it's a nice dress and it could have been lovely, I didn't enjoy wearing it at all.","June 12, 2019","True to Size"

I do generally wear a size 16 but I'm always weary of companies and the crazy size differences between them. I think my favorite thing is that I didn't have to wear a bra. I *always* have to wear a bra. BUT NOT THIS TIME, LADIES AND GENTS. The length: It was almost too long. I wore 2-3 inch heels so it was perfect but I'm on the verge of their recommendation for choosing the long option vs. the regular. If you're between 5'7"" and 5'9"" and plan on wearing heels, definitely go for the long. If you don't plan on wearing heels, go for the regular. LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress!!!!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN68","Christine","Fabulous one-of a-kind dress that is super flattering!","I love, love this dress. It fits like a dream. I am usually a size 10-12 at RTR and wore this in a size 10. Given the smaller size that I selected, I didn't have to wear a bra since my boobs (C-cups) were nicely held in place. I could have also worn it in size 12 if I wanted a less tight fit. The embroidery is stunning and the colors are gorgeous. This dress will gets you lots of compliments! I am 5'7"" and the skirt hit me right above the knees. Perfect length for a wedding. I wore it with a green pashmina wrap. Oh, did I mention the big pockets!! :- I will definitely rent this dress again.","November 7, 2017","True to Size"

The dress was comfortable and easy to move in on the dance floor. The details are elegant and showed off just the right amount of cleavage. I wasn't going to wear a necklace but the necklace seemed to tie the outfit together. I also didn't need to wear a bra. I am typically a size 4 but sized down to the 2. In my opinion, it fits a little big, but not much. This dress is sure to make your next event special.","July 24, 2017","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN68","Marissa","LOVED THIS DRESS. So many compliments, no one had anything similar.","Amazing color and I am obsessed with the flower detail! Much more purple than the picture shows. Matched perfectly with my boyfriend's navy suit. It's a fitted dress, not stretchy at all. Very tight in the bust. It actually didn't really fit my bust (36G), I could not zip when wearing a bra. But I just adjusted and it ended up working by showing more cleavage. Hides rolls well on the front, recommend spanx for the back.","December 16, 2016","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN68","RTR Customer","Stunning and comfortable. Pockets!","Gorgeous dress with the bonus of being comfortable and easy to wear. The embroidery and fabric are both incredibly lush. I received many compliments and was delighted with my choice. The 6 was a snug fit so I went with the 8 so, real talk, I could eat and drink freely at the wedding. Based on other reviews, I was worried the 8 would be too big in the shoulders since I have narrow shoulders, but it was fine. If I owned the dress, I'd have them taken up a smidge; for a rental, it was perfectly fine. I styled with the Nicole Miller Star Light Star Bright necklace from here, a gold clutch, and gold pumps. Pros: You can wear a regular bra You don't need to wear Spanx Fully lined Rich color Pockets! Cons: The fabric wrinkles really easy - but it's also forgiving. The size 8 fell off the hangar in transit and it was a bit of a hassle to steam it, but it fell back into place pretty easily.","October 30, 2016","True to Size"

It was a little longer than I would have liked but I wore 3""-31/2""""heels that helped. And since I'm kind of petite, the torso was a little long which made the shoulders ride up if I wasn't careful. If I had a hand in a pocket (which I loved about the dress )it kept it in place.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN68","Melissa","Perfect for a summer wedding!","I would describe the dress as true to size, although the bodice was pretty fitted. If you are in between sizes, I would size up. The quality of the embroidery was impeccable. The dress was more low-cut than I realized, so keep that in mind if the event is more conservative. As far as length goes, I would recommend the dress for someone tall like me. I'm 5'8"" and it hit perfectly but might be too long on someone shorter.","August 22, 2016","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN68","Sam","Stylist Review","Perfect style for your next formal event! Running true to size we recommend sizing up for backup as it is fitted throughout the midsection. There is no stretch to the fabric however there is comfortable room at the bust for so this would work for any cup size. The fit and flare style makes this perfect for any body type, especially for those with a wider hip. At about 5'4/5'5 this style hit right at the knee. Due to the elaborate detailing on the top portion of the dress I would pair with minimal accessories!","June 28, 2016","True to Size"

What most impressed me is that the top didn't move at all. No matter how I moved (tested it out at home, lol!) the girls stayed safely tucked away.

No option for a bra, so its probably best for B or C cup. High heels necessary since it runs quite long. If you have a very long-torso it could be a problem, but it hit me just right. You do need very flexible shoulders to get in and out of it for the bathroom!

Fit as expected- order 1 size up from your typical dress size. Usually a 2, the 4 was fitting but not tight. For length - I had the regular, would have loved a long (I'm long legs and 5'10) but the regular would be appropriate for most. The fabric in bust area is fairly thin so if you're larger than a B you'll need something. It's not thick enough for support but perfect for a small bust without help. Beautiful, classic, and well made. Wear a good pair of earrings and a single bracelet or a ring (no necklace). You'll feel simple but better dressed than everyone else- the epitome of style.","January 1, 2018","True to Size"

It's definitely low cut, especially if you have a shorter torso, but that was fine for a bachelorette party in Nola. The dress is really heavy and just a little itchy under the arms, but ultimately a great dress, and not itchy enough to be an issue. I would rent this again!","June 18, 2019","Party"

I thought I was going to be a L but the M fit me perfectly and I got compliments all night. You can get away with wearing a bra if it's low cut (for reference I'm 34DDD), that's if you're comfortable with your girls on display. Now it is a little heavy (the dress) when you first receive it but once you put it on it's fine and it sequins aren't irritating at all.

The large was a little tight so I wore the extra large, but I could have worn the large if that was all I had. The top seemed to stretch out towards the end of the night though which was odd.

I used some fashion tape so I don't have to worry about any malfunctions while I dance the night away but the dress fit so well that I would have been perfectly fine even without it.

I was able to wear a regular bra that is cut a little lower in the front. It wasn't a plunge bra or anything, so it was nice to feel supported all night. The dress has some stretch and the stomach area is VERY forgiving. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the shoulders were a little big and the lining around the front kept rolling outward. It wasn't super noticeable, but it bothered me.

It's cute, comfortable, fits as expected (true to size), and would be flattering to lots of bodies. I liked it but was looking for something more interesting. The neckline was plunging, but on a smallish chest (34B) it was by know means too showy. I would consider renting it for another occasion.

It's so so hard to zip up or even down at certain points on the zipper line. I couldn't wear a bra with this since it wouldn't have fit. So other small busty women take note of that.

It is the perfect combo of formality and fun. Pros: it is surprisingly secure around the bust given all the cutouts; the placement of the cutouts is very flattering and has a slimming effect; the fabric is comfortable and high quality. Cons: the fit isn't perfect if you are hourglass shaped, I found the back/shoulders to be snug while the waist hung loose and low; the regular is super long, I'm 5'3"" and wore 4"" heels and it draped to the ground. Overall, I felt like a movie star in this dress and found it perfect for a formal wedding in 90 degree evening weather in Bangkok.","January 28, 2020","True to Size"

I was afraid the bright pink with the open back and the low cut neckline would be too much for a black tie wedding, but the dress fit so well it wasn't an issue. My chest was held in all night without any kid of tape and I am a C/D cup. The only issue I had was the length. 2R was still really long with 3"" heels.

I am already short-waisted, but this was very short in the waist/crotch - since it is all one piece it rode up in the front/crotch and was very unflattering. Meanwhile the straps were long, and it was very low-cut in the back and under the arms - there is no way to wear a bra, but it is so loosely cut that it won't give you any support without one.","March 4, 2019","Formal Affair"

Not bra friendly.","I would have worn this again and again if the back of the jumpsuit didn't dip down so low. The material is comfortable and has a beautiful shine. The belt is detached and gives you a nice waist line. It was the perfect height to wear with heels and I could have almost worn flats but the fabric would have dragged a bit. For reference I am 5 feet 4 inches tall. If you have a longer torso, you may want to skip this jumpsuit. I have an average length torso for my height. Just a little longer of a torso and I would have had a camel situation.... :/ I had planned on wearing in Chicago for Valentine's Day. No bra in Chicago in February just isn't comfortable.","February 5, 2019","True to Size"

The dress did have some weird creases when I took it out of the bag, so we had to steam those out. The top is definitely large for anyone with a narrow rib cage and a smaller chest. I'm a 32A and had to wear my bra that amplifies the chest to be a couple sizes larger so that the dress didn't gap on top. The size 2 was huge on my chest, so I'm glad the 0 worked. The waist is fitted, so if you have a small chest and more of an apple shape, this dress probably won't work. Overall, loved the dress!","May 21, 2019","Large"

I have a larger waist for someone my size, so it was a tad snug at first. By the end of the evening, the dress felt comfortable. I received so many compliments on this dress. I'm about 5 feet tall, 110lbs and I wore a size 0. I tried on the size 2 and it was way too big in the top. The size 0 was slightly large in the bust, but not noticeably so. I also loved that I could wear regular underwear with this dress. Comfort all the way. I loved my backup dress as well, but the size was too small. I will order it for my next event in the correct size.","October 20, 2018","Party"

There's no stretch in the chiffon. I tried a 20R in this dress and it was way too small. I typically wear an 18/20 off the rack. The dress has two under linings which makes it a bit warm.

With a large chest and not having a narrow waistline, I had to go with the 12 which unfortunately was a long. With 3-4 inch heels, it was a little too long but worked. If you aren't comfortable with cleavage this no not the dress for you. I loved it and was comfortable all night. I had to adjust a few times but that was from having to size up to accommodate other areas. The zipper was a little difficult even when just on the hanger.","November 4, 2018","Small"

It was elegant, simple, and yet noticeably glamorous. I am 6 feet tall. I did not wear heels. However, my ankles were still visible. I would've liked it to be longer. The reason for four stars is because I have a smaller chest and it's obvious the woman that wore it before me stretched out this top area. So I was constantly adjusting it. Other than that it was a hit! I would definitely wear it again.","August 23, 2018","Date"

I'm not very tall and the length was actually a little shorter on me than I expected, and I had to wear flats. If I were to get this dress again, I might get the long so I could wear heels.

This dress was the perfect option for my sister-in-law's wedding. It has a solid back, so you can wear a regular bra (or pumping/nursing bra, in my case.) I didn't receive the 16WR, so I'm not sure if that one would have been a better fit, but the 18WR fit very comfortably. The cross front top made it easy to access for pumping mid-reception in my car without stripping down, but still stayed together so I felt covered and not like I would fall out at any point while dancing. The bottom was lined without much stretch as described, but it was still very true to size, so there was room to move.

The dress is very long - I'm 5'2"" and wore the petite length with 2"" heels, and still tripped over it a bit when I walked up stairs and had to be careful about sitting/standing in chairs that it didn't get caught. The top is also very big so I had to tape/pin it at the chest so it wasn't too revealing.

There is a lot of material on the top and I felt it made me look larger than I already am. If I had some prep time, I think double sided tape would have done the trick.

Because of the short notice, the only size close to mine that was available was 10L (I'm 5'5"") so it was definitely a little long on me but beautiful nonetheless. A little big on the bust (I'm a 36D) but a carefully positioned safety pin was able to do the trick. Definitely would recommend wearing this dress.","August 10, 2017","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM370","RTR Customer","Lovely comfortable flowy dress","This dress is incredibly well made! It is so flowy and light but still had 2 layers of lining so it was not see through at all. It was perfect for a 78 degree Chicago summer wedding. I wanted a maxi dress because I didn't want to have cross my legs all night long and to hide kinesiotape that I need on my knees every day. This fit the bill. My husband loved the dress on me! I wore a size 20 because after 3 kids in the last 4 years I need a forgiving dress. This was forgiving it a lot of ways. Some maxi dresses make me relook pregnant again but this did not. My chest is a 38 DDD and I often have a hard time finding dresses that fit well enough on top and aren't too long or too big everywhere else. This dress for my chest size was too big. The arm opening area was huge in the armpit to the point that I was constantly worried my undergarment would show. Also it was so big on top that the back of the neckline kept hiking up on me (I'm 5'6"") that the zipper would catch in my hair at the nap of my neck. Other than that it was a great dress. I was worried it would be too long and it was alright with 2 inch heels. Flats, I would have been stepping on it. Overall, a pretty dress. This was my first experience with RTR and I am trying it again in November.","August 9, 2017","True to Size"

It is not for anyone who wants good chest coverage though. The cut is beautiful and the dress stays in place well, so what starts out covered stays covered. The waist is tight with no stretch, but everything else about the fit of the dress is comfortable. At 5'4 (and a half) I was able to wear flats without any issue. The dress floats out of the way when you walk. If you are thinking of wearing it to an outdoor event in summer in someplace like Florida, be prepared to be hot. There are two layers of not that breathable lining underneath the beautiful outer layer.","June 11, 2017","Party"

I was very warm the entire time!! 2) The cut of the dress wasn't fitted enough around the torso for me. I ended up having to belt it to give it a decent shape. I've had this same issue with other dresses by this designer (Badgley Mishka), and won't rent one again. They're just not flattering for women with narrow waists.","June 9, 2017","Wedding"

The cut was super flattering--I didn't need to wear shape wear or even a bra with it. The colors are beautiful, I got tons of compliments. The one downside is that the seam of the collar got pretty itchy/irritating after a couple of hours. But in general, this was a winner. Highly recommend.","August 27, 2019","Wedding"

I loved the way the satin lining felt and where the waist hit on the dress.

If I bought it (which I am thinking about) I would need to have the torso altered—it is just too long from the shoulders to the waste so it bunches in the back in a weird way.

It does run a little small and the pencil skirt is a little restrictive going up stairs and dancing. Also the zipper goes all the way up to the neck, so definitely wear your hair up if you have long hair, and it doesn’t work well with scarf around neck since it got caught in that as well.

I was unsure of what size would fit best, so I got the pink one because it was available in 16W (and I was worried that designer clothing might run small). When the dress arrived the 16W was way too big, so RTR overnighted me this dress in the regular 16. The fit was perfect! I absolutely loved that this dress was not revealing and hit below the knee- so classy without looking old. The color was amazing in person, and I got so many compliments on the dress all day. I typically wear a size 16 in dresses and a 14 or 16 in pants, and the fit of this dress really was spot on. I will say that similar to other reviewers I did find the neck to be a little scratchy, but it was not unbearable by any means. This was my first rental from RTR, and I can not say enough good things about the stellar customer service and quality of the dresses. Rent this dress- it will not disappoint!","June 13, 2017","True to Size"

I think with a forgiving fabric I would be a size four but rented a 6&8. Size six was a bit loose but perfect for the shape wear. I used misses kisses low plunge backless push up ""bra"" to get my boobs situated. The straps are a bit long for my petite body so consider a way to pin if needed.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP3","Tracy","Glamorous but tricky.","Overall I think the dress LOOKED great - loved the color and the style, the quality of construction was very good. The challenge with this dress is that (like many women) I'm a different size in the bust (8-10) than I am in the hips (14) but unlike my wedding dress (which was the same size I wore for this - 14) I'm not able to either a) 'get away' with wearing the bigger size on top or b) alter the dress. I tried wearing a stick on bra since one of my favorite features of the dress, the plunging back, did not allow for a regular bra. Even then I felt conscious the whole evening, making sure to stand and sit up very straight for fear of exposing myself on top. The alternate size I ordered was the 12R and while this was better on top, the fabric does not stretch or give at all and I wasn't able to move easily from the waist down. If you are close to or equally sized on top and bottom, GET THIS DRESS! It's stunning and benefits from woman with proper curves filling it out. If you are like me and less 'even', know that it might be trickier. I would recommend to others but would not rent again myself.","March 7, 2019","True to Size"

It doesn't hide your insecurities though! Wouldn't recommend for anyone who has a tummy area they want to hide. I had to find the PERFECT spanks for it. Because of the low back, they still showed a tiny bit. I'm middle of the line as far as bust goes (32 D) and I was scared of a nip slip. I wore a sticky bra just to prevent it!","February 21, 2019","Formal Affair"

However, the material has almost no give, it does not stretch. I was afraid I was going to burst a seam when I sat down, luckily I did not! I would recommend wearing this with spanx. Also, there is no real support built in for your breasts which is disappointing given the lowcut back of this dress, which does not accommodate most bras. If you're tall like me, you should definitely opt for the tall size. The regular is too short. It was fun for one night, but I would not rent again.","February 17, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP3","Lara","I wore this for my Oscar-party murder-mystery 30th birthday party and felt very fancy and sexy!","This dress fit true to its size 4, which for me meant the top fit except the straps were too long (I usually wear size S/ 4 in shirts) and the bottom was VERY tight (I usually wear a size 6/28). If I had worn the size 6, the top would have fallen off. I’ll echo what someone else said in their review: this dress works *best* for people whose top and bottom halves are exactly proportional to each other, since it’s a woven silk and doesn’t stretch, but I felt sexy even though the fit wasn’t perfect. I found the “extra” fabric at the stomach a little annoying, until I had apps and cocktails. ;) But if you have a very flat tummy, it may hang strangely. On length: I’m 5’4” and don’t wear heels, so the dress was a few inches too long, but I never tripped over it. In the full-length photo, I was standing on my tiptoes, so if you’re taller than 5’7” this dress might be short on you. I would probably rent it again!","February 6, 2019","True to Size"

It definitely hugs all your curves in the right places and it's true to size. Love the crimson color and the lace detail is beautiful but holy cleavage. I am a 36DD and everyone at the event would have definitely known it. This was a work related event as well, so even if I felt pretty uninhibited it would not have been appropriate at all. I also don't like how the sewn in cup detail is so tiny so if you're anything above a B-cup, the cup will look like it sits in the middle of your boob. Weird.

I ordered 2 sizes based on some reviews saying to size up. I ordered a size 6 and 8. Size 6- The straps were a little loose with some side boob. It fit super tight around my hips. To sit I had to raise the dress up. Size 8- It was really baggy around my stomach, waist, even around my hips. It did not compliment or show my figure. The dress is not made out of stretchy material. Without heels it was the perfect length. In the photo I wasn't wearing heels. With 5 inch heels it was like wearing a high water dress. But still beautiful.","December 9, 2018","Wedding"

The fabric is SO soft and flowy and perfect for dancing or spinning around. There isn't much stretch, so make sure to get a larger size for your backup (I ended up wearing my larger backup). It is tight in the hips and butt and sitting was somewhat of a challenge, but if you have a less curvy figure then you won't have a problem. The lace makes it look feminine and romantic, and the thick straps kept everything in place without any tugging or adjusting.","November 5, 2018","Small"

I would go for something stretchier next time, as the fabric made it difficult to sit down. The length was perfect with 2.5"" heels.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP3","Amy","Love the deep red color and flowy bottom!","This was a last minute choice when the dress I ordered could not be delivered. The color was great, a nice deep blue-red. I liked the lace trim touch, but did need to iron them to keep them from falling down (I also used skin glue for one floppy piece). In fact, this whole dress definitely needed to be ironed, even after I hung it up for 24 hours before the event. I went braless because the back was too low, and the front was just low enough that a Nubra would have showed. It was also quite tight and leaves little to the imagination (even my seamless thong showed through, so I went commando). It is lined, but the soft flowy fabric is slinky and everything shows through. The 0 was quite snug on me, particularly around the hips/butt (I have a bubble butt). There isn't really much stretch, maybe none. I opted for the 0 because the 2 was too long, the straps kept slipping off, and it was still tighter than I would like on my butt. All in all, a lovely dress, just not very forgiving. I am 5'3"" and wore 4"" heels, which made the length on the 0 perfect.","October 17, 2017","True to Size"

Appropriate for any formal event, but just as relevant for a cocktail party!","The fit is a bit odd, it seemed rather loose in the lower tummy, tight in the rib cage, then loose in the chest again. But sizing up (actually went up two sizes based on reviews, but probably depends on your body type) made the rib cage thing a non issue and the tummy and chest were still form fitting enough (though my preference would have been tighter). Otherwise an amazing dress. Incredibly slimming, stays up easily, i felt snug and covered all night while still flashing skin! Wore to a formal wedding and felt right on point. Would have felt just as right at a slightly less formal event too. So multifunctional!","October 18, 2018","Wedding"

The cut of the dress is more for a straight frame through the hip area. I would've loved wearing the medium that fits well in the bust area, but it would have needed to be a tad bigger through the hip area for proper fitting for 40 inch hips.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA292","RTR Customer","Love/hate relationship with the slit, but the dress did the job!","- I wore this dress to a 1920s-themed holiday party for work and loved it! The slit adds some sass to an otherwise modest/classy dress, which I loved. The slit is also the dress's Achilles' heel, so I knocked a star off my rating. More on that below. - I ordered an 8 and 10 and wore the 8 comfortably. The top and waist weren't super flattering on me (I have a smaller bust.) A 6 probably would have been more flattering on top, but uncomfortable. - Beware that if you choose to wear nylons with this dress, choose ones that don't have the darker ""shorts"" section at the top. They will probably peek through the slit. - As other renters noted, the slit gets dangerous when sitting down! The venue I was at had velvet booths, which proved to be a bit of a nightmare with this dress. They pulled and twisted the dress until I was wearing practically nothing. I was glad there were black cloth napkins within reach that I could place over my lap while I ate and scooted in and out of the booth.","January 22, 2018","Large"

The slit is a fun and sexy detail to an otherwise modest dress. It's not too high that it was overly revealing (I wore it to a family wedding on NYE), but definitely got higher when sitting or crazy dancing. I got a lot of compliments, and the dress was very comfortable (bonus- you can wear a regular bra!).

Simple black dress with dramatic slit makes it a perfect statement piece but may be a *bit* too risky when sitting (slit opens up high on the thigh).

Ran a little small for me in the bust and midsection so I'd recommend sizing up for curvier women.","October 31, 2018","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PPL30","Jodi lu","Not sexy, but wonderful","The stretchy silk and pattern is gorgeous, but my mother saw this dress in my closet and said it was frumpy and hideous (mind you, I'm 40 - I promise I don't still live with or typically listen to my mother!) I decided to wear my other option to an event instead and just wore this to dinner, but everyone besides my mother loved it. It's the only time in 10 years of marriage that my husband asked to take a picture of me, because he loved this dress SO much. He insisted I buy it, that it was so flattering on my mom-body, but at the current price point, I might just wear it another couple of times then return it. I personally love it, and the print hides lumps, but if it was ten years younger with boobs and a waist, I might opt for a more flattering silhouette.","October 23, 2018","Everyday"

Didn't love the dress because it made my chest look very large.","I am a big fan of this label, but I didn't love this dress. The white/pink flowers at the chest, coupled with the high waist, made my chest look very large. Otherwise, it is a high-quality dress made out of textured silk and with a beautiful print. Skirt is longer on the sides and back than in the front, where it is quite short. I usually wear size 10 on top and size 8 on bottom (5'8"", 153 lbs, 36C). I rented this dress in US size 10 (UK 14), which fit well everywhere except that the shoulders and upper arms were a bit snug. Also, there wasn't much extra room at the waist or hips, even though that is where I usually wear size 8, so I would say that this dress runs about a size small.","October 21, 2018","Small"

I wore it to my husbands grad school graduation and it was perfect for the ceremony and dinner afterwards. I rented the small and extra small, expecting to wear the small. The extra small could've worked but the slip and waist would've been uncomfortable. The dress was true to size. I am hourglass/pear shaped, 32d, 5'4"", 130lb. A few notes... the nude slip is short compared to the hem and had to be pulled down after sitting or walking. The slip is also really form fitting and could put unwanted attention on the tummy/bottom, so something to consider if you liked this bc it was an a-line. A few reviews mentioned tight or itchy lace around the sleeves. I didn't have that experience. I noticed the fabric but it was not something that made me consider wearing a different dress.

I wore the dress to New York Fashion Week and felt so beautiful! I got tons of compliments, and a NYFW videographer even filmed the outfit. It was such a Cinderella moment for me - thanks, RTR! My one stipulation is when I saw all the reviews about how short and tight this dress is, I thought people were exaggerating. They weren't! I'm 5""6 and 125 pounds with a slender, athletic build and felt like I was squeezing into a small, haha. In person the dress was much sexier than I imagined. It's more of a clubbing outfit than a work-appropriate outfit. But overall, I was obsessed with this dress and would even order it again. NYFW, 2021?","February 12, 2020","Small"

By the end of the night I felt the neckline was bothering me a bit, but I honestly don't think that was the dress but was more about me not loving things around my neck.

I rented a ton of dresses for the event, and this was was hands down the winner. The fabric is on the heavier side, which is nice because it flattens the tummy. That said, there is not much give. If you're pear-shaped, I'd size up one because it's tight in the midsection. For those who find it gaps in the chest area, if you cross the straps in the back instead of the front, it will be much tighter.","October 3, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMR12","Jl","Fantastic, flattering dress for hourglass shape!","This is one of my favorite RTR's of all time. This dress is very flattering on and the other reviews are accurate about the high-quality fabric, midi-length good for petites, etc. I would say that the size 2 fit me well because I have a very narrow ribcage w/ a larger bust, but it was a squeeze in the hips. Overall it looked great, but a little room in the hips would have made even better, but there was no way I could have worn a larger size in the waist or bust. I taped the top of the dress with fashion tape to secure opposed to pinning straps, which kept the loose top/ straps secure all night. Wish I owned this dress! Want to find more cuts as flattering as this style for my body type. p.s. I nearly ordered a 4 and 6 after reading reviews, but unfortunately, we suffer from inaccurate sizing syndrome.","November 15, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMR12","Carolyn","Pretty pattern! Way too big...","There is very little give or stretch in this dress. I read the reviews saying that it runs small, and I decided on an 8, even though I am oftentimes a 6 or an 8. I ordered a size up for my back-up like Rent the Runway recommended. I should have gone with the 6. The 8 was massive! BUT, true to size perhaps for people who are a size 8. My only thought was that the women that wrote it ran small have been victims of vanity sizing at other stores...this does not run small! True to size or a smidge big... It was so big I tried to use safety pins to pin the top in, but the material is so thick (not hot) that I couldn't. You could have fit two hands down the back it was so big. The neck straps and the key hole on top didn't look good because it was so big. Overall, I just had a baggy dress all night long! You can see in one of the photos just how baggy the dress was on top. I would recommend going with your normal size, and if you have a small top like I do, going with a different dress. You really need large C or D cups to fill it out.","September 8, 2018","True to Size"

I'm usually a size 8, but sized up to 10 based on the reviews. Thank goddess for that because I needed the size 10. Honestly I could've gone one size bigger but the top did not fit. I had to tie the straps to fit my body frame. Still such classy womanly dress. Love!","August 26, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMR12","Mary ann","Fun, elegant, flattering, form-fitting, great quality thick material.","The dress was thick and held in everything well. I usually wear a 6 or 8 in a dress, but had to order a 10 at the last minute. I ended up fitting my hips into the 10, but then the bust was too big (I'm a 36B). It was an easy fix to just safety pin each side on the top about a half inch and it worked out perfectly! It looked like I took it in! The dress was the perfect length for my 2 inch heels and 5'5"" height. I didn't need to adjust the straps but they were a bit longer than I would have liked but they worked as long as I stood up straight and didn't hunch over. I wouldn't have needed a bra except that I needed to fill in the dress better, but it would have held them in well enough. It was form-fitting just enough to be very flattering. I would order your size and a size up. I did wear a mini corset underneath to flatten my myself out, but I probably could have gone without it. :) All in all it was an amazing dress. It was perfect for my husband's youngest sister's wedding. It was fancy enough but not too fancy. The material was a slight satin so it made it very elegant. It wasn't a white background really. It looked to me like a very, very light pink background with purple and pink flowers. It was very beautiful and I felt confident wearing it. I would highly recommend this dress.","August 23, 2018","Small"

It was hot as heck and even though the fabric seems thick, I didn't feel like I was melting. I wore it with a bustier and it felt a little hard to sit at times. Fabric doesn't stretch.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMR12","Briana","Designed to dance - but not to breathe","Such a fun, playful dress that begs to be danced in. It is a gorgeous material and a flattering hourglass cut. The drawback is that the ribcage is super tight and for someone with a long torso, the tightest part of the dress was at the ribs, and the 2 just wouldn't zip up. I ended up wearing the 4, which was still tight in the lower ribs but loose in the hips and upper chest. It is designed for someone with a more dramatic waist to hip ratio. So while it gave my more straight frame some nice curves, the cut was a little off. Still, it was a beautiful dress and absolutely a ball to dance in.","July 24, 2018","Wedding"

It's a rich thick glimmering material and the color is kind of a really really pale blue but in a gorgeous hue. SThe flowy bottom fabric was so perfect! Would be SO fun to dance in! -- Fit is a little off, but not enough to notice on my. I'm 5'8"", 130 lbs, 32C, hips measure 38.5"". It runs small (maybe 1 size small?) on the bottom especially around the hips, but perfect up top. I ordered a 2 & 4, and this is the 2 that I wore. I could've worn the 4 on the hips but it was too large thru the bust. Overall I still loved it! It was sooo comfy except when sitting, because as I mentioned the fabric has no give. It was hard to breath when sitting if sitting up straight, but I was standing for a lot of the time. --I wore no bra, and the fabric is thick enough you don't have to worry about special underwear! I don't even think you would need Spanx. I loved that I didn't need a ton of jewelry with it because it is already such a stand-out piece itself!","May 26, 2018","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA187","Becky","Pretty neckline/shoulders, not overly ""dressy""","I am between sizes, and, while both a 12 and 14 fit, I opted for the 14 because I wanted to feel ok crawling in and out of cabs, etc. I have a larger chest, so I was a little concerned about the bra situation. It does cut low down the arm-holes and it a strap-racerback. I was able to wear a bandeau solid black tube-top bra w/o it showing. The beading detail is lovely and a really nice ""showpiece"" for this dress. The color on the beading is more grey (blue-toned) white, so the right shoe might be a strappy silver or black with silver detail. I wore nude/black wedges and no one called me out, but I wished it matched up a little better. You can get away with wearing minimal jewelry for this one as well because of the beading and neckline---so you will save a little $ and effort there. When I looked at pics of this it seemed a little more like a shift dress, but wearing it, it was just a slightly looser sheath. Zips on the side and it didn't stick on me---it's always nice not to have to get an assist.

My one (small) complaint was that it was a thicker material than I had imagined it to be so it wasn't as flowy as I thought it would look once on. Not a huge deal at all but the thickness of the material caused it to be a bit more constricting than a thinner fabric would have been. I wore the size 6 although honestly I wish I had ordered a size 8 as a backup instead of a size 4 because I think I would have been slightly more comfortable in an 8. Nevertheless, it was a great dress and I'd wear it again!","June 29, 2017","True to Size"

For that purpose the dress worked, it covered up my chest entirely, didn't have flashy cut outs and hit just at the top of my knee. I chose not to wear a bra and the dress didn't do much to flatter my small chest. It was comfortable to dance in all night, I'd recommend for a more modest wedding.","December 4, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL96","Corey","Sleek and Sexy","This dress was awesome! I can usually go between a 4 and a 6 in dresses since I usually don't buy ones so fitted but for this one since the other reviews said it was snug, i went up to the 8 and was so glad i did. The 8 fit great and looked great, but the slit in the back did rip twice on me. I think if i had ordered a 10 it may have fit since it runs snug but otherwise i've never worn a 10 so i wouldn't have thought to order that much up. Both times it ripped was when i was either opening my leg out to get in a car or out of a chair. So if you have a big booty, the dress is awesome but definitely use caution when moving your legs while sitting. Color was great, not too bright of a coral but also not dull. For reference for booty size i wear a 27/28 in jeans. I also thought this dress was great for petite, any longer and i would have looked silly but it ended up being a really flattering length although it was not a petite dress and the model it hits near her knees.","October 23, 2018","Small"

This exposed my sides more than I wanted because I was at an evening wedding surrounded by very traditional family. But they didn't consider my bare skin offensive at all (ha) and I got tons of compliments - not bad for a mom of two young ones :-). It's so easy to wear, so comfortable, yet very chic and elegant and edgy and different all rolled into one. I wore the XS and it fit longer than the model since I'm only 5'3"" (117#, 32B, 33-26-36), but I still loved the length and everything about it.

I'm 5'11 and use a wheelchair, it's very comfortable and easy to lift up when I had to use the restroom which is always a challenge with dresses. The cut outs are high fashion and not trashy. Perfect amount of tease to leave em hanging ;) . I'm small up top so I'd definitely size down since this dress runs slightly on the large size.

Switched to the MR which was much more comfortable on my chest and arms but made the waist fit larger. This is just gorgeous detailing. On my frame (5'3) the hem of the dress reached my ankles with a 3 inch boot. The sleeves were a bit longer on me in the MR but I was going for a dressy boho look so it was fine. I would definitely rent and even purchase this dress because it can be dressed up or be more casual.","March 13, 2018","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ASI12","Liz","Fun and Diffeent Take on the LBD","This dress is so much fun and definitely a twist on your classic black dress. People noticed it and I received lots of compliments. The SR fit perfectly with enough room in the arms and upper body to be comfortable. It is hard to lift your arms over your head.if your between sizes I would size up as it doesn't stretch. Im 5'4 and it cam to just about my ankles. I did feel a little uncomfortable sitting because if you slouch at all you might get some spillover on the side. The sticky part of the dress that holds the bottom in place was a little worn but still worked. I really enjoyed this dress and would rent it again.","March 11, 2018","Formal Affair"

The length was perfect (stopped right at my calf) and it wasnt too tight or too lose in any areas. The one con I will forwarn you of is the skirt slip! ITS EXTREMELY SHORT! Especially for ladies who have curvier lower bodies. I was extremely self conscious when I sat down, stood up, and walked. Be mindful of this when you rent this dress.

The L was just a tad bit larger but fit in a way I could wear comfortable undergarments without worry about them being visible. I'm normally a M and could have 100% worn this in a M as well. I loved this dress and will likely rent again. One item to note--- the cute strappy detail is a bit loose. I had to manipulate them to keep them tight. Also, the dress has no zippers.

The shoulder detail definitely made it more unique than your standard LBD! I am starting to realize that shift dresses just don't work as well on my shape as I'd like them to. It was comfortable, but a little short, and since my bottom is a bit bigger it just fit my waist awkwardly. I ended up passing on it since it just didn't compliment my curves as I'd have liked, but I would still give it a shot if you're looking for a simple, easy option to add a little something new to a classic black dress look!","February 1, 2019","True to Size"

But the arms, shoulders, and bust were VERY snug on me in both the medium and large sizes, which made it look sort of unbalanced and ill-fitting. A slighter, slimmer person than me, with a small bust, could probably wear this and look great, because it would fit like a shift dress. On me with curves and thicker arms/shoulders, it looked odd.

The cut out and slit give it an added touch of sexiness without being too much. Stretch material makes it comfy to dance in all night, and length was great for a spring wedding. Only complaint is the adjustable straps made the dress seem a bit cheap and the thick fabric made is so I COULDNT adjust them so they were uneven all night. The cutout means no bra, but good quality thick fabric so it was totally fine.","April 27, 2019","Wedding"

As a first time customer, this was actually my free second dress option which I was grateful for because my first option was too large. While the fit was perfect, it did have a tendency to ride up a bit which ultimately wasn't a big deal considering its length. The dress was very comfortable for a long night of dancing and fortunately had adjustable straps.","April 16, 2019","True to Size"

I was nervous it would be too ""holiday"" for spring, but it worked great as a staple LBD; lots of compliments and the fabric holds together well (not much stretch to it, so aim for your true size). The 10 was just a hair more snug than I intended, but the 12 I think would have been too loose. Being shorter at 5'3"" I was concerned about the skirt length. It. Was. Perfect!! Right above the knee (perfect length for an evening work function) and just enough volume without being ""poofy"". I DO wish it had pockets though... I paired with black open toe heels like the model pic, Art Deco-esque drop earnings, and a bright red matte lip. Would rent again in a heart beat.","April 25, 2019","Formal Affair"

The slightly shiny polka dots elevated this from a normal little black dress. I am top heavy and the top on the 8 was a bit tight, so probably could have gone with a 10 for more comfort there, but other than that fit great. (I usually wear anything from a 6 to a 10, mostly based on room through the top). Skirt does flare quite a bit, but I thought the proportions were flattering.","February 7, 2019","Formal Affair"

I ordered a 12 and ended up needing the 14 because this dress is quite snug across the chest. For ladies with an ample bosom like myself, it is a good idea to size up in this one. The narrow band at the natural waist & flare of the skirt make this dress very flattering and excellently camouflage any belly. It was also very comfortable, the fabric is quite thick, so it probably would not work for the summer, but was perfect for this cold snap! I will definitely rent this one again!","January 22, 2019","True to Size"

If you are taller than 5'5"", you probably need the medium for this reason. That being said, the medium worked fine, and I got tons of compliments.

It is so well made-- the fabric is thick, falls nicely on the body, and the entire jumpsuit is lined. It's incredibly flattering; I have a long torso and short legs but the waist hem sat at just the right place on me and the length was fine (the slits on the outside of the pant legs are a fun touch!). The color is a beautiful tomato-red, a touch on the orange side. You do have to wear a strapless bra. My only two critiques: (1) it was a bit of a challenge to go to the bathroom because of the hook and zipper so it's better to have someone with you (but that's what you get yourself into wearing any jumpsuit) and (2) the straps that cross in front of the neck lay a bit funky, one of them folded over on itself as I wore it (I tried to steam it out with no luck).

It was comfortable (form fitting but not too tight), looked formal enough for the occasion, had pockets, and had fun, flowy side slits in the pant legs. It was perfect to dance in! I'm also not usually a red person (see: sunburn), but I actually loved the color. I got so many compliments-- even from the bride!

The color is a rich red with subtle sparkle with some sequins sewed in. I think a regular nude bra would work fine but there is a pad sewn in, so it may not be necessary.

I did choose a size up as my back-up size, but this was definitely true to size. The fabric ended up being thicker than I'd imagined, which was good because I never was scared of any accidental tears. I'm 5'2'' and the dress ended a bit above my knees.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN123","Janet","Great, unique dress","The embroidery and lace on this dress is beautiful and gives it a formal look despite the simple silhouette. The mesh panel in the midriff gives it a nice bit of edgy style. Per some of the other reviews, it can fold over a bit weird, but I think it's one of those small things only you notice and not anyone else. It's practical - easy to move in, not too hot not too cold, not too much skin but still interesting, a nice pop of color. All in all a great pick. I also liked that it seems like it is not a super popular option - after trying on two other dresses with hundreds of reviews (this one only had like 5) - this dress was in much better condition and felt much more unique.","November 7, 2016","Wedding"

IT's a beautiful color and feels extremely comfortable. Not itchy or heavy. I didn't wear it because I had another dress to select from, if not I certainly would have. It is not curve hugging, the nude part in the middle is not forgiving if your wear full body spanks, but overall a beautiful dress.","October 31, 2016","True to Size"

I didn't realize there were sequins on it when I ordered. The sheer in the middle was interesting, but it didn't feel like it added anything to the dress.

This is an fun, easy, throw on dress that will make you feel put together and pretty once you get to your final destination, after running around the city. The scuba material is light and breathable, but I would recommend a pair of spanx underneath, just because scuba material can sometimes hug in places you don't wait it to.

Fabric is light and has a full zipper, so you'll need someone to help zip it up. I normally wear a small, but I couldn't even get it over my hips. My backup was a medium, and that still felt tight. I sat the entire time so it was fine, but if there'd been dancing no way would I have been able to. Also, it's very short, and I'm only 5'2. If you're taller than that, you're probably gonna be uncomfortable. If you're petite, not curvy, and small to medium in your chest this is gonna be a good fit for you.

This one I might have flashed people had I bent over and I know I would not have been comfortable wearing it. So it is pretty, but if you are taller I would not wear it.

The color was a beautiful deep red, perfect for a fall wedding, and I LOVED the sheer slits in the legs. Definitely a unique piece. I'm 5'10, so typically speaking, ordering long is the best route for me. I'm between a 4 and a 6 and went with the 4L. The length was great (worn with 2"" heels), but it was baggy in the armpit area, torso, and on my bum. I tried to pin it a little bit but couldn't make it work. It wasn't enough to be a huge noticeable difference, but it was just enough to bother me for the duration of the evening.

The color is WAAAAY prettier in person! The sheer panel on the sides went up to mid thigh and it wasn't too sheer! It was more sheer near the ankles. The jumpsuit definitely runs large. I wore the 2R and it still had room, but it was still worked! Being 5'4"" and short torso'd, I didn't like how shapeless it made me look.

I read reviews saying that the sizing was small, so I ordered up a size. It fit good, but was a little snug in some places. The band around the waist was tight, so it bunched up in the back. It was the perfect length, with or without heels. I loved the slit on the side, and thought it added a lot to the dress. It for me around the chest, but I think it would be pretty tight if you are larger than a C cup. Overall, beautiful dress.","May 19, 2019","Other"

I'm also busty on top, bump out in the rear, and have a little bit of a pouch when I neglect to keep a lean diet. That said, I typically avoid straight and narrow dresses, and opt for fit and flair, but read the reviews and took a stab at this one. Picking the size was very tricky, though, because I'm a true, busty, 10 on top and curvy 12 on bottom in separates. As this is a one piece, I went with the 12 and was thrilled at how well it fit me overall. A padded strapless bra helped fill in the top just the right amount. The fit and fabric were incredibly flattering and I received so many compliments. Only cons were that I personally needed to unzip the dress down to go potty and the dress twisted a bit so I found myself readjusting to center...but maybe that's just me.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG71","Season","Perfect in Periwinkle!","When I first saw the dress out the bag I was underwhelmed and thought I got something too plain but I loved this dress! It took me forever to find one for this event and I was going back and forth but this is a classic shape you can’t go wrong with. Get this! But for details read more. For sizing what everyone said was right. Don’t go your usual size, size down. While my normal size of a size 8 didn’t exactly fall off of me it was certainly looser in the bust and hips. So the backup size 6 worked better for me. Also if you’re short like me I’m 5’3 the slit can come up kinda high, at least for my taste but it’s not truly a problem unless you’re popping your leg out the whole time. And for the hot day I wore it, it was definitely good pick to stay cool. Last drawback was that you can kinda see the elastic through the fabric at the top of the dress (I’m guessing too many washes) but it doesn’t show up in photos, it’s just one thing I would add if I was being really picky. This dress has way more pros in cons great dress for the occasion and a compliment magnet! With this not being my first rental, RTR always works me.","September 27, 2019","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG71","RTR Customer","Gorgeous dress!","This dress is gorgeous! The color is stunning and I think would look great on any skin tone. I'm fair skinned (more so than you can tell in my edited photo) and was worried about the light blue but it looked great. I am 5'4 and 120 lbs and ordered the 2 and 0 because I read on some reviews that the dress runs large. I normally wear size 2 and it fit great. The 0 fit on top but was too tight in the stomach and hips and made the slit sit weird. The only thing that drove me a little nuts about this dress was that the chest is so big. I am pretty small chested (34b) but even after reading reviews thought I'd be ok with one of my many strapless, very padded bras, especially ordering such a small size. I had no issue with keeping the dress up, but the elastic on the top puckers and I couldn't get it to lay flat. I think that would happen unless the dress was so taught you'd be popping out. Not the biggest deal, I think it only bugged me so much because everything else about the dress was perfect! Still have to give it 5 stars! Great light fabric and easy to dance in thanks to the slit. The only warning I will give is that like other reviews said, between the cut and the light fabric the dress isn't forgiving whatsoever. I wanted to try spanks because I was nervous about my booty dimples and always pig out at weddings but the slit it too high. My butt looked fine and as long as you're not self conscious of your midsection and can relax it's great. Very classy but also sexy and would work well for any wedding, including formal or black tie.

The size 2 was snug as well, but I was able to work with the just area a bit more. I did have to wear a strapless bra with a lot of cushion for it to still fit the bust area. Although this dress looks great- I gave it 4 stars because the fit was a bit awkward. I'm 5""4 120 pounds and I had to adjust the dress by pulling it up all night. Other than that- love the dress!

RTR sent me this dress and another (the one I had originally ordered wasn't available) to the hotel I was staying at. I picked this one because I loved this style, but I have to say the quality of the actual garment was lower than usual. I think the one I wore had been worn A LOT. The hook and eye were barely hanging on, and one part ended up falling off at some point. There was a little white stain under one arm that looked like it might have been paint and didn't come out with a shout wipe, but it wasn't really noticeable. The fabric also didn't hold its shape like other Jay Godfrey dresses I've worn, and the rubbery strip at the top kept exposing itself. All things considered, though, I still loved the way the dress looked, I just think maybe the one I wore needs to be retired.","May 3, 2019","Wedding"

The flowy skirt was great when we were walking and talking. A little bit difficult to find a bra that would work with this since the back has an open/cut pattern. I found one that was the exact color of the dress and it wasn't noticeable when it peaked out. Pretty long, I am 5'5"" and with my 5"" heels it was the perfect length. Great dress!

I was perfectly pleased with the entire process as well as the dress. I rented both the 2R and 0R. The 2R was way too baggy on my stomach and silhouette. I usually am a 2, but this 0R fit me perfectly. The fabric is soft, high-quality and thick (without being heavy). There is no stretch to the dress (not that it needed it ). I loved how the gown hugged my curves without being overly sexy. It did show some cleavage (which I wanted lol) Even so, ALL the older women and men at the event continuously complimented my dress and figure in it....so it must have just been classy enough.","December 11, 2017","Large"

The neckline is a deep v, I had to where a backless strapless plunge sticky bra and it worked perfectly. I'm a C cup and found the straps to be just a tad too long, forcing me to pull the dress down and expose more cleavage.

At 5'5"" I'm a bit short for floor length dresses from RtR (my last maxi dress was under my feet all day even with huge wedges on) but the asymmetrical bottom of this dress made it perfect for my height. My shoes peeked out, not too much of my leg showed, and I didn't step on the dress all night even after I changed into flats. The color was the perfect blush pink to match the other bridesmaids whose dresses were a combination of other RtR dresses and purchased from bridal shops.

I wore it as a bridesmaids dress in my best friend's wedding and I have never felt sexier in my life. The dress runs true to size for bridal (i.e... one size up from normal dress wear) but is very stretchy! With that said, it's unforgiving.... shapewear is a must if you don't want to see every single thing. If I had to choose a downside, it would be the bra situation. I had a cross back which worked, but not perfectly... the back cuts down too low for a true strapless so you just have to compromise. I am a 32DDD and had plenty of room up top. So with that said, probably not ideal for anyone below a C cup. Last thing, I got regular length and it worked perfectly with 4 inch heels with me standing 5'5"".","August 13, 2017","Wedding"

It is kinda heavy though, so definitely recommend for an indoor event. I wore 2.5-3 inch wedges and didn't have much (if any) of the dress dragging.

Elegant and a little sexy, Hollywood glamour style. I am between sizes 4 and 6 usually and even though I have DDD cup there was still a little room in the bust area in the size 4, so I would say the fit runs a little big. I managed to make a low backed bra work instead of the stick on type, which was great. The length was perfect with 4""heels (I'm 5'6"") the ends did not drag on the ground and it hit perfectly even when I kicked my shoes off to dance.

The length was also great (I'm 5'7"" and wore 3.75"" heels) and the high-low cut was nice, since I didn't have to worry about tripping on any fabric in the front of the dress.

The little cap sleeve was perfect, and not too tight so I was able to lift my arms easily.

Highly highly recommend! And for any expecting mamas out there, I wore this dress when I was 23 weeks pregnant and it worked perfectly! I normally wear an 8-10, and ordered a 12.

I could have worn the backup size 12, but it was a tad too snug around my chest, and my sister convinced me to opt for the more comfortable one. Glad I did! It was SO comfortable. Going with the looser option, I didn't have the issue that other people had with sequins rubbing underneath my arms. The length was great.

It looked more like a prom dress than a black tie gown. The way the bust is constructed there are these weird darts ABOVE the nipple line...which my breasts sit pretty high so on someone who has lower breasts this would be an even bigger issue.

This dress is made of quality thick material, is easy to dance in, is extremely comfortable, and looks nice. It's sexy but still conservative. My main priority for dresses are that they are flattering in the stomach area - without shapewear, I didn't feel self-conscious about my stomach. I give it an 8/10 on the flattering scale. The top fit well - I didn't need a bra and think the top would also fit well if you have a bigger chest (C-DD). The dress was very short - it wasn't even long enough with flats. For reference, I'm 5' 10, about 145 lbs , B cup. If the length isn't an issue for you then definitely rent this dress!","January 14, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID11","Rachael","Simple but modern, figure-forgiving","I wore this to a black tie wedding, with accessories also from RTR. I really liked the fit and cut of this dress. I labeled it as true to size, but I would say it's a little on the forgiving side- I'm a bit heavier than usual and I'm wearing between a 6 and 8 in other dresses, and the 6R fit me very well. This skimmed over what other dresses made look not-so-great, and I did choose to wear a pair of Spanx shorts underneath, though it looked fine without. I didn't wear any sort of bra apparatus as I've tried sticky bras, tape, etc before and always tore them off mid-event in frustration. This dress, despite the 'boob window' as my boyfriend deemed it, didn't show off much unless you were looking in from below, to the side. People with larger chests may have different results. (I'm a 32DDD which sounds big but really isn't.) I was able to easily move about and dance, which I really liked. I am 5'3"" and wore 3.5"" heels and the dress just swept the floor. IMO it was a bit shorter than other 'regular' length dresses I've gotten from RTR but that worked in my favor. Girls 5'5""+ may want lower heels or to try the Long.","December 29, 2018","True to Size"

The backless feature is stunning and the detail of the criss-cross neckline and front keyhole is so flattering. As a 34B, I felt that the chest was a little roomy, but definitely not anything noticeable to anyone else.

I am typically a 6 so I would say it's true to size. I have long legs, large hips and a bigger ""behind"" so the slit was definitely high but not so much that I was exposing anything and I still had no trouble sitting.

However, there was a lot of room in the bust/midsection area. It was very comfortable throughout . I am 5'3"" and this dress hit me mid thigh, it was a very comfortable length.

Showed a little more up top than I would say is appropriate for work but still gorgeous. The material is thick and seems very well made. The length hits around mid calf. Sadly, it's exceptionally fitted...around the tummy. Even after sizing up to be on the safe side (I'm generally a 14/16,XL) no such luck. Didn't even wear it. If you have a tummy and over a size 12, don't bother.","June 19, 2019","Work"

For bra needs, I wore the stick-on rabbit ear style bra cups, which worked great and didn't show through. For undergarments, I wore a seamless no-show thong. This dress leaves little to the imagination when it comes to what is underneath, but the material soft and stretchy. I LOVED the cross back and the halter neck. The 4R was way too long for me, even with 4-inch heels (I'm 5'-5""). Would recommend! True size.","November 17, 2019","Wedding"

The dress was a little scratchy under the arms and at my feet. Trying to walk quickly in it resulted in the sequins rubbing the tops of my feet. I have a pear shaped body, smaller on top, bigger on bottom. Sometimes I can wear an 8 in gowns - especially ones that have a fuller skirt, but the 8L was too snug around my hips and butt, so I went with the 10L.

The lace under my arms did feel a bit scratchy throughout the night, but nothing too uncomfortable that would make the dress less worth renting. I was very happy with this dress and received compliments all night long! I rented the 14R and 16L and ended up wearing the 14R with 2 inch heels and the length/fit was perfect (the 16L was too loose and way too long for my 5'4"" height!)","January 4, 2019","True to Size"

It just didn’t suit my body proportion. It was also big which didn’t help. In the photo I was wearing 3 inch heals and it was still really long. The 2P would have been better. The material makes it hard to use double sided tape too since it’s heavy and beaded. If I was taller I would probably have loved this dress. That being said, it seemed to be good quality and my husband loved it. Just wish it fit better.","January 3, 2019","Large"

I am normally a size 10 and it fit perfect! It was absolutely stunning and I got so many compliments. I am a small busy so be aware- the front has a low cut with the beading lace over it. I just wore a black strapless bra for coverage just in case. Was a little long since I am only 5’2”- did get caught a few times on my heels but overall a beautiful dress that did not disappoint! Perfect for any age especially someone wanting something with a little coverage- back and shoulders in lieu of a strapless dress.","December 22, 2018","True to Size"

It fits perfectly and looks elegant on a pear shaped body. My hips were minimized and my butt looked great. I didn't wear a bra with it (32B) and felt comfortable and secure. The inner lining is soft so you don't need to wear tights/shape wear. It's so classy and not ostentatious at all--so while I was the only one in a floor length gown, I was not over dressed at all. I'm 5'7'' and the Long size was perfect with my 2.5 inch heels but would have dragged with flats. Rent this!!! It's incredible.","December 21, 2018","Formal Affair"

It was a bit snug in the middle, but I don't have much of a waist. I carry my weight in the middle. Spanx sure did help this issue. :) This dress is very well made and with high-quality fabric. It's heavy but in a nice way. The 12 regular was a touch too short for my taste as it hit midway down my 3.5-inch heels, so I chose the 12 long. The 12 long was a touch too long but was never a nuisance (I didn't need to hold it up while walking, nor did it trip me up in front). The dropped neckline was the perfect touch of sexy, yet still modest with the lace overlay. I was able to wear a black strapless bra, and even though I could see it, everyone else thought it was a part of my dress. The picture doesn't do this dress justice. It's was definitely a win for me!","December 18, 2018","True to Size"

The ONLY reason this dress gets 4 stars, and not 5, is because the zipper on both dresses was incredibly difficult to zip. Could not have done it without another person for sure. The beading is gorgeous and the pictures do NOT do it justice. The long length was great (I'm 5'10"" and wore 4"" heels and it hit the floor perfectly). There were some plastic threads that were loose on the beading but nothing too noticeable. Overall, a good dress!","November 21, 2018","Wedding"

I wore 4 inch heels and still had to ""hem"" the bottom up with safety pins by ~4 inches (I'm 5'5"", 120-125 lb). This wouldn't deter me from renting it, but if you're back and forth between this dress and another, it's something to consider. One thing I didn't realize from the photos online was that the ""metallic"" is actually partially from black sequins. I do love sequins, so it didn't bother me, but I was surprised when I opened the box. Overall I was very happy with the dress!

My only problem with this dress was that the shoulders were so tight it made sitting down hard. I mean I could sit down as long as I was sitting straight up which was fine for the first 2 hours then got a little restrictive. This could be just a ""me problem"" because I'm a CrossFit power lifter and have a broad shoulders. The dress is also incredibly short! I could only wear kitten heels with the long!","March 11, 2020","Formal Affair"

It was a bit long only because my shoes were flats. The material is great and there is stretch to the fabric. I had no difficulty moving and dancing in it even without a slit. It is shaped to turn this pear a bit more into an hourglass. One issue that may have been part of the design is that the lining in the front was about two inches longer than the lace. The back was even. Great dress!p","January 22, 2020","Formal Affair"

The lace top is sexy without being over exposed; tight fitting through the waist and then flowing skirt. The top has lots of structure - maybe wear it without a bra, but for me it looked better with a strapless bra. I am 5'10. I ordered a long. Was able to wear heels and it was still long. The back hem is longer than the front - I did step on it a couple of times. Highly recommend this dress for an elegant evening.","October 20, 2019","Formal Affair"

There is a built in corset which kept digging into me. I wore my own bra underneath which may have caused that. The dress is extremely form fitting, mermaid style, and tight above the knees.

We weren't somewhere that we were dancing, so it wasn't a problem. Very comfortable to wear all night. Lots of compliments!","September 27, 2019","True to Size"

There is a built-in bra that makes the top of the dress super flattering and helps support the sexy low ""v"" back. The silhouette of the bottom half of the dress was gorgeous and made for some great photos. The color is great for any season and has a bit of sparkle throughout the lace. The fabric was actually very breathable despite how well-made the dress is, which was perfect for this 100F+ wedding! I'm on the shorter side so the regular length (versus the long option) was perfect for me. Highly recommend this rental!","July 15, 2019","Wedding"

My original two dresses in this style had issues with the satin hanging below the lace in front, indicating that perhaps the dresses had been cleaned one too many times. Fortunately RtR overnighted me another, then I could I truly appreciate how beautiful this dress is. Perfect color, bit of glitz, glamorous without being over the top. It runs small, particularly up top. I usually wear a 4L, the 6L was ok, 8L most comfortable. If you have assets you will definitely need to size up.","April 26, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA29","RTR Customer","A beautiful and very comfortable gown!","This dress was perfect. I read in the reviews it ran a bit small and short so I opted for the 8 long. I normally wear a 6 and while I'm only 5'3 I knew I wanted to wear heals so I went with the 8 L. I think the 6 L would have been perfect. The fabric is high quality so it still was form fitting. You really don't need much with dress, the neckline needs no necklace, it's just the perfect amount of sparkle, even the bra on the inside is perfect. I'm smaller chested and the dress was a smidge big so I opted to wear one anyway just to try to fill out the top some more which ended up being a perfect solution. I received so many compliments. I felt so glamorous in this gown. I would absolutely rent it again!!! It's worth noting that my ""problem areas"" are my lower belly and my thighs. I often can't wear dresses because when they are tight or even form fitting they usually pull in the thighs but then the fabric is baggy on top. Not in this dress at all. This dress was slimming in all the right places. A great dress for curvy ladies to feel absolutely sexy. THANK YOU RENT THE RUNWAY!","March 2, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA29","Bianka","This dress is beautiful! It is a gorgeous deep blue color that sparkles in the light!","I rented this dress in a size 8L and ordered the 10R as my backup size. I actually ended up going with my backup size for two reasons! The first was because, despite being 5'8"" and wearing heels, I felt that the Long was TOO long. I felt like I was going to step on the train all night long, and actually did a few times in the Regular length. The second reason was because my 36B/C bust and wider ribcage ended up being too squished in the 8. While I liked the waistline in the 8 better, the AMAZING built in bustier in the 10 fit me much better and was much more flattering. This dress is figure flattering and modest at the same time. Overall, I highly recommend it for a ""black tie"" event when you want to wear a subtle pop of color!","February 17, 2019","True to Size"

It is just such a beautiful dress. Literally everyone complimented me on it. It's true to size for a formal dress. I'm normally a 6-8, but I usually wear a size 10 in formal dresses. This was consistent with that. Be aware that it is a fitted dress and hugs your body tight through the mid-section and hips. That's the style. It is also very long.

Given it zips in the back, its not like I could see the tiny fringe parts to remove or have the ability to deal with this. I had to wait until my husband got home to unzip the dress. It was so frustrating. It was cute enough but not cute enough to deal with that so I sent it back.","June 18, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AAD26","Joelle","Perfect for a fall/winter wedding","Great dress! I have a petite bust and thicker bottom so although the medium fit ok, it was slightly too large up top so I opted for the more fitted small. It felt quite snug around the waistline when i first put it on but once I was moving around it was comfortable. Would recommend for a black tie optional wedding as it’s long enough to be classy and appropriate without the hassle of a floor length gown. Color was more rust/brown than red but was very pretty for a Florida “winter” wedding. Would rent again!","March 11, 2019","True to Size"

The large fit well, although I wish there would have been more room in the hips (absolutely no give there, it will a little tight - I couldn't size up because I was pretty much swimming everywhere else in the XL). I thought this silhouette was extremely flattering, and I thought the colors were perfect for a winter evening wedding in the Midwest! FYI, the cutouts on chest and around waist aren't lined, so I'd suggest either a nude bra or no bra. I would rent it again, but I will admit that I prefer a similar dress that the designer has made (Green Over Black dress).","March 5, 2019","True to Size"

A little breeze will blow this thing right up and I gave folks a bit of a show. I felt so pretty in this dress but honestly was terrified of walking outside in it again because it blows up so easy.

This style is fitted throughout the midsection and somewhat of a shift at the hips. It works best for all cup sizes. You are able to wear a standard bra with this wrap dress. At 5'5, the length hit floor length on me. This stylish silhouette is very comfortable and has a split that adds an extra accent to your overall look.

Unfortunately the top was REALLY large (and I'm a C cup). I had to wear a tank top underneath, which was fine, but really detracted from the overall vibe. The way the dress wraps is also not quite right. It was like I couldn't get it tight enough around my waist without the actual dress being tied (as opposed to just the strings). Similarly, the strings were SUPER long and actually got caught on my chair at work and untied the dress at one point. Luckily no one was around when I came apart. Disappointed in how it worked for me - maybe with fashion tape it could be better for others.","July 10, 2019","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/GRL38","Jessica","Unwieldy","The color is beautiful but the fabric is quite sheer. I had to pin the bust to keep it from gaping and the true wrap, combined with skits on both sides proved to make the dress super unwieldy to walk around in. I wore it on a somewhat windy day and had to hold the dress down the entire time outside. It also was problematic to sit in. I order to keep the fabric from gaping in front, I had to tuck it between my legs, exposing a lot more side thigh than I'm comfortable in. I'm 5'10, so the slits on the sides came up a lot higher in me than I'd normally like. I wore it on a Friday at work with a blazer and felt fine while standing still but was super self -conscious walking or sitting. Beautiful but a pain in the a$$ to wear.","June 19, 2019","Everyday"

I feel like this is a dress for all occasions. Can't go wrong with classic black. The bow is adorable and I was happy I didn't need to go strapless under the dress.

I had my first child 3.5 months ago and lost all of my baby weight plus excess and wanted to find something comfortable but classy to accommodate my new body especially since my boobs grew but I lost my curves. The dress has a cut out in the back and hugs the body bringing attention to areas that may be considered problem areas for most women so making sure you wear proper undergarments is a must. I wore spanx to suck in my belly and a proper bra to lift my boobs and to keep straps from showing in the cutout back. The dress has a slit and isn't too short but make sure your undergarments are seamless. I felt warm, classy and comfortable and I highly recommend this dress!","April 13, 2018","Other"

The fabric and cut of the dress is flattering and I think that for being a form fitting dress, it managed to disguise my tummy area. It had great stretch too, making it extremely comfortable. I think it did end up riding up a bit as I danced throughout the night, but honestly I was not too concerned about it. The sltit is not crazy high in the front and the back of the dress fell above the back of my knees, so it is not scandalous if it does ride up.

I wound up wearing it because we were out of town for a formal event and I didn't have any other choice. It was fine but just strange because I'd say my butt is proportional to the rest of my body and I always wear an XS.

It runs a little large and I had worn the XS and you can still tell it was big.

The tweed like texture was so unique, and also offered warmth in the winter. I wore with a regular bra (because the cut out is higher), black tights, and knee high black boots. I didn't wear jewelry since the dress was so busy! I felt that the fit was tight on the upset half.

I think this dress serves better as a new years eve party dress, or a bachelorette party dress or even a wilder birthday (my husband's birthday was at a random bar).

I love that the sequins aren't super shiny, so I didn't feel like a walking disco ball. The cutout adds a cool, sexy touch without being too much. Docked one star off because the fit was a little off for me (large in the chest, slightly long in the torso, length was almost to my knees), but I'm really petite, so I expected it to be overall a little big.

Pros: A very comfortable dress to spend time in. It was easy to move in, so if your occasion or party is a little more active then this dress is appropriate. Cons: If you are large chested I don't know if this dress would fit. I am very small chested and the fit was very close.

It wasn't a first or second choice it was actually my 3rd choice but it was definitely the best. I didn't end up wearing my first choice. I asked for a size 8 but the tag says XLR. The fit wasn't great but this dress fit perfectly. It was stretch which was good. It also had long sleeves and I have really long arms but I still had some that I could bunch up at my wrists. It you have larger arms, this isn't the dress for you. The sleeve are slim but in addition to long arms, they are also skinny. One thing to note though, it does conform to the shapes your body makes. Meaning if I sat for a long time, there was 2 indents where my knees were in the dress but I just pulled it back out and it went straight again. I'm 5'4"" and the dress just hit the floor until I put on my 2 inch heels and then it was right at the top of my pumps. For someone taller it will obviously be shorter.

Running true to size with stretch in the waistband, I recommend ordering your true size. This style is roomy throughout the midsection and loose and flowy at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You not able to wear a standard bra because of the one-shoulder detail so you should wear a strapless bra or a convertible bra where you can remove the one strap. At 5'3 the length hit mid-thigh to knee length on me. I love the colors and print and how flirty this dress is!

However, the arm holes seemed really short and cut into my armpit. I think if I could have somehow retied the strap it would have been a little loser, but the bow is sewn in to place.

The material has some stretch to it. The shimmer is very light- barely noticeable. I am small chested, so you may want to size up if you have a larger chest or broad shoulders. After wearing it for a little while, I did start to get a little uncomfortable because the off the shoulder part was a little tight around my arms/shoulders. And as with most off the shoulder dresses, you can't lift your arms, so I don't suggest this if you'll be dancing. I wore it to a rehearsal dinner though so it was perfect.

It was lightweight but well-made, just enough frill for a 40-something like me to pull off at a festive event. The event was a success and so was the dress. I got compliments all night long. I did not wear a bra with it and it was fine! I am a 38 C and it was a little loose on top but the 12 was too snug in the waist and there was no give.","November 7, 2017","Party"

I was able to comfortably wear it without a bra and Spanx without worry. I can't even count the number of complaints that I received. It is fun, flirty, and sexy. The best part about my experience was that RTR was totally willing to overnight this (and another dress) to me, in a totally different city, for NO charge when my original dress would not fit, and my original back up was damaged upon arrival. This dress was simply meant to be. I would rent this again in a heartbeat. Fit me true to size.","May 10, 2017","Formal Affair"

I felt that the dress ran a bit small. The bottom skirt part of the dress is full, layered and really pretty. Great for my hips! The top, however, didn't fit me well at all. I have a B-C bust size, and I probably needed a C-D bust size to fill it out on top. The top part of the dress is a stiff mesh, and it just didn't lay that well on me. To be clear, though, this dress was not recommended for my body shape but I saw it and decided to get it anyway. Probably wasn't a good idea to do that! Even though it didn't fit me that great, I did have fun wearing it.","January 2, 2017","Small"

I opted for the 12 because I wasn't feeling great and wanted to have a bit of room. If I'd been feeling a bit sexier the 10 would've been tighter/more form fitting.

The straps also fell often but that may have been caused by a lack of chest. The dress also felt a little worn in the underskirt from being rented often but I still really loved it.

It does fit very large though, which I guess it better than too tight. I usually wear a 14 in most things and a 16 in most dresses. So I ordered a 16 and up to an 18 just in case.

The netting did come slightly wrinkled, so be sure to take it out of the bag and let it hang for a day (or hang in the bathroom while you shower)","December 12, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL168","Sonja","Large bust, beautiful dress","I received notice on Wednesday that I had to attend a formal ball on Friday. RTR really pulled through and got me this dress Friday afternoon. This dress is really beautiful and perfect for a formal affair. Unfortunately, the top was MASSIVE and I had to use a lot of strategic fashion taping to make the top somewhat work. I would suggest sizing down if you have medium or small bust. Length was good, though did drag a bit in the back. I think three inch heels would've done the trick.","December 8, 2018","Formal Affair"

Stretchy material was accommodating to curves. Event was a conservative cocktail dress, this was perfect. Only surprise was base material was more sheer than expected, a nude half slip did the trick.

I am 5’7” and typically wear an 8-10. The large fit perfectly and was a wonderful length. I wore black spanx and you could not tell the midriff was sheer. It slips over your head and has a little elasticity to it so it fits very well. I wore it up on my shoulders so a bra with straps was fine. It was a lovely dress, I would definitely recommend and would absolutely rent it again!","May 17, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FZ20","Sandra","I've never had more compliments or felt more comfortable in a dress!","This dress was completely comfortable, and the compliments were off the charts! I did wear a spanx body suit underneath it, because the midriff is sheer. But that just made for a slim line and I was honestly treated to compliments all night. I was SO sad to send this dress back. I LOVED it.","March 1, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FZ20","Brittany","Lots of compliments! But had its downsides","I rented the LR and XLR for a wedding event and I chose to wear the LR. The XLR also fit but was a little too long in the front. There were some previous reviews about the sheerness of the dress that were valid. The top portion is not see through at all, but below the waist is questionable, depending on lighting. I ended up wearing leggings under the dress for cooler weather and you can see in the pic where my middrift is visible in the photo. I think this dress would also have been fine with some sort of spanx or slit underneath. EVERYONE wanted to know where I got the dress, tons of compliments. However, the dress is pretty poor quality. I wouldn't pay $75 to rent. Its maybe a $20 rental value? If you can get a discount price and prepare for underneath, its a good rental! I'm happy with the process and will definitely Rent the Runway again!","January 16, 2018","Wedding"

A little tight in the shoulders, but a good fit in the busy. The dress is two thin pieces of mesh. It's very thin, and the wind blew right through it. Thank goodness I had a long coat and thick scarf. My legs were freezing, and the dress is a little long. Would be great for a summer event. Not good for winter.","January 23, 2019","Formal Affair"

I am 5'3"" and about 135 pounds. I could have worn this dress in flats and it would have been just off the floor. It is 2 layers and both are see through black but you can wear undergarmets to make that work. The dress was very comfortable and flattering. If you want to get your hair and makeup done before getting dressed, note that this is a pull over the head dress.

Fabric is light but very high-quality, and contains a good amount of stretch, which makes it skim your curves ever so gracefully! I'm 5'6"", and I wore the XS, which fit my body perfectly and fell to the bottom of my ankle bone. The vibe of this dress to me is very 1950s Parisian, and it's so beautifully made that it DOESN'T look charicatured, unlike many dresses that throw off a vintage vibe. I wore a knee-length black slip under it, because the skirt & underskirt are rather sheer; there's also a sheer band on the torso, but that didn't bother me because the fabric is beautiful. You could dress this dress up or down in a snap. Rent it, you can't lose!!!","February 20, 2018","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CS79","Nanda","Ideal for a slim or pear shape, not so much for curvy or hourglass, elegant, versatile","This is a good option for when the weather is colder (thick fabric) and the dress code isn't completely clear (versatile outfit). I'm normally between a size 0 and 2. I tried on 3 sizes: size 0, too tight overall. Size 2, perfect on my waist and butt, way too small on top. Size 4, a little more loose on the waist and butt, still too small on top. Size 6, perfect on top, too loose, sort of baggy on the bottom. However, since the party I wore it to was more conservative, baggier was better. My suggestion is to choose your regular size for slim and pear shaped bodies but size up (even 2 sizes up) for hourglass, busty, or curvy bodies. It is also pretty long so ideal for taller women or with high heels. I'm 5'4"" and needed 5"" heels to make it work.","February 6, 2019","Small"

The material is nice and thick and the dress hugs curves nicely. I went up two sizes, so definitely size up for your back-up dress. Also, the slit in the front is quite high on taller girls.

The fabric is thick and sucks you in but there is little room for error nonetheless. I wore spanx with it. I characterize it as running small because I am typically a 4P in most Rent the Runway dresses of similar style to this one, but I could've potentially benefited from a size 6P in this dress. It might be because although I am petite, I have an athletic figure. It is sexy but still covers you up so I believe it to be appropriate for a work-related function. I was happy with this dress and would rent it again but would size up!","December 27, 2018","Small"

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size, for your primary size. (add if true to size) and going up for your back up. This style is roomy throughout the midsection and, loose at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are able to wear a standard bra with this dress. At 5’3, the length hit knee length on me. The black color with the multi-colored piping on the ruffles keeps the outfit fun. Pair with heels and cute earrings to complete your outfit!","February 2, 2019","True to Size"

The bustle felt huge on me, and the cut-outs on the arm felt like an unnecessary extra detail given the amount of action on the skirt. It does run a full size large - I usually get a 4, this was a 2 and for one minute I considered swapping it for the size 0. The fabric doesn't have much stretch, and the sleeves are cut fairly generously, so it looked better when I pushed up the sleeves. You're pretty covered so it's a good winter party dress, less so for other times of year. But I rented in December, wore it with black opaque tights, and I felt great in it. Excellent example of why RTR is so wonderful - I would never buy this in a million years, but it was a blast to wear it once!","December 16, 2018","Large"

The silhouette, length, low back, and colors were fun to rock, but the modest neckline kept it feeling classy. The sleeves jut out a little awkwardly from the arm pits (part of the fit seeming large) but not enough to be a dealbreaker. I wish the skirt were flat and fitted to complete the sleek, modern feel, but it had a bit of a bubble cut which was disappointing. Highly recommend pairing with a purple lip!","May 22, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW3","Nicole","I felt beautiful for my law school graduation!","This dress was perfect for my day- it made me stand out and matched my mood! The dress was a much stretchier fabric than expected, which made it SUPER comfortable. It seriously felt like I was in pajamas. Despite that, it was still substantial enough that I didn't need a bra, and I was able to wear nude boy shorts. In case you were hoping for a little more structure to help your midsection or something, though, you will probably be disappointed. The only downside of the comfy stretchy fabric is that it wrinkled very easily (i think you can see in the pictures). The 00 and 0 both fit, but I went with the 00. The 0 was mainly only too big in the sleeves/shoulders- and I do not have small shoulders by any means.","May 5, 2019","Other"

Nothing that was not fixed with the tape. This dress is not loose, but not insanely tight. I had plenty of movement in it and was able to dance all night long in it. I enjoyed the bright colors and felt pretty sexy in it. The back is absolutely gorgeous! I obviously did not wear a bra but tried out the silicone nipple sticky things and that worked perfectly to help smooth out my boobs as well as adding a tiny umph to them. Perfect for the occasion and got lots of compliments! Oh, and I opted for the blue shoes (jcrew) once I got myself ready and put the dress back on.

I'm a 34B and the top was a little big on me, but if you wear a push-up bra, that'll do the trick.

I would say the 6 fit like a 4. The 8P was too loose and well too long even with heels. In the 6P I didn’t need a bra as the boning and bodice fit well. In this particular dress, the boning was starting to poke through the liner and would’ve been torturous if I hadn’t worn shapewear under. This was my first RtR experience and I was very pleased with the selection, pricing and process.

I'm 5'3, wore 4"" heels, and the dress still dragged in the 4R. However, I am a 34D and the dress would NOT zip because it's a side zipper. Once I finagled it closed, I had to hold my arm up to show a somewhat flattering view, with the dress pulled higher than intended, and I'm still spilling out.

Class all the way.","If you are familiar with Herve, this is a great piece, all of the fit, with none of the legs/boobs, for a more formal/conservative affair. Don't get me wrong, you will still turn heads with it's signature curve clinging material. I was happy that this dress didn't seem 'worn out' as sometimes girls squeeze into Herve, when they should really size up. I am 5'4"" 130lbs, a 34D/DD, and although i could squeeze into an XS, Small is the way to go for girls my size. You don't have to worry, it's plenty tight, the arms hit perfectly, not too baggy or floppy or awkward. All of the marks of a designer dress. I adore Herve, and wish they made a lot more conservative pieces like this. I am too old to have boobs hanging out everywhere, or a mini skirt on in front of my teens. This allows you to look great, and still look CLASSY.","May 4, 2018","True to Size"

It is really comfortable. Underwear and bra lines are visible despite the material and dark. color. I wore a maidenform slip. The high cut neckline, color, and high quality of the dress made it conservative enough for a wedding despite the curve hugging tightness and short length. The medium was too roomy in the back. The small was a perfect fit. I got this dress as a replacement after my first (and cheaper) choice wasn't able to ship. I'm not sure I would rent it at full price. It didn't stand out enough for me. It was missing a ""fun"" element. But I'm sure the right jewelry and accessories could change that. I just didn't pick the right ones!","October 29, 2017","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PH50","Katie","Lovely dress with great movement","This dress was an alternative choice when my original dress was unavailable. It's really beautiful with lovely movement for dancing. The fabric is unusual - it almost has a spandex/scuba suit feel to it, but it's lovely and does not wrinkle at all. It runs large, I'm typically a 10, but wore the 42 (which is suposed to be a 6!?). The waist of the dress fit very high on me (I'm pretty long waisted), but still looked fine. It is very low cut - I wore it to a benefit for a nursing home run by nuns so wasn't comfortable with the amount of cleavage. I added a light weight spandex-type tank underneath and it looked like part of the dress. I would definately rent this again for the right occasion.","December 20, 2017","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PH50","Nina","Perfect for Cold Wedding Ceremony","Material is super thick, which was great for a November wedding where the temperature was 30* and the ceremony portion was outdoors! It is a classic, elegant dress. However, if you're short like I am (5'1""), the dress runs long. It hit a little above my ankles. I liked the dress a lot, and it fit everywhere perfectly, but I probably wouldn't rent it again just because of the length.","December 5, 2017","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PH50","Meghan","This is a twirling dress!","This was my back up dress after my original choice wasn't available. I'm normally between a 12 and 14, but when the stylist recommended this dress, she suggested I get the 44 (US 8) and 46 (US 10). I was nervous it was going to be too small, but the dress has so much stretch I ended up wearing the 44, and maybe could have worn a size smaller! My favorite part of this dress is the skirt. When someone twirled me for the first time on the dance floor there was an ""oooo"" from everyone around me! With the fullness of the skirt and the weight of the material it made a pretty impressive effect. A few cons to the dress: 1. the waist line was either too high or two low. Where it hit me was not bad but not quite flattering enough. Maybe if I had a smaller size it would have been better. 2. The arm holes seemed fine at first, but I ended up futzing with them in the front. And when I took the dress off at the end of the night it was a little red running from my shoulder to my arm pit. 3. Why, oh, why does this dress not have pockets?! With the fullness of the skirt they would blend in perfectly! Overall, I would recommend this dress as it was mostly comfortable, looked nice, and had a great twirl. Definitely order down at least a size if not two or three.","November 22, 2017","Large"

Super thick and HEAVY fabric but was super comfortable and plenty of room to move around. I would have been better wearing the size 38 as this was a little too long and not as fitted as I would have liked.

A crop top isn't an option at work. I realize the sweater I paired with it is probably out off style, but was the only thing in my closet. I think these pants were just too cool for me.

I typically range between a 4 and a 6 depending on how things fit at my chest. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to wear this dress as the material is unforgiving and clearly shows all trouble areas (my tummy for me). I didn't think it was very flattering, so I opted for something already in my closet.","May 1, 2019","Wedding"

It was snug enough where I didn't have to wear a bra with it, but it didn't suffocate me! However, the area around my back and waist absolutely swallowed me. It bunched up when I would walk and I didn't feel comfortable enough to wear it out. On me the dress ended right in the center of my knee!

Both sizes fit, but the size 0 tugged across my thighs just enough that I chose to wear the 2 instead. I was thrilled that the length was perfect despite being short, and the straps tie so the top was adjustable.

The top fit me well, but the bottom was very tight and the mid section baggy. On top of that, the slit of the dress is pretty high and it scoots to the center of the body with movement. I ended up not wearing either of the sizes I got in this dress.","April 14, 2019","Wedding"

I did have to be mindful when sitting down as the slit came up a little high but used my napkin or clutch. I got compliments all night and the back is fun too!

I ordered the 10 and the 12 and I wanted to wear the 10 because the length was a little shorter, but the underlayer wouldn't sit right and it bunched up the bottom of the dress so I ended up going with the 12. I liked this dress but wish it was a little bit shorter but overall very comfortable and easy to move it.","October 14, 2018","Wedding"

The thin scuba material is so flattering and forgiving and the cut of the dress is great for pear shaped gals. I want to wear this everyday. I will say the weird built in bra was annoying and didn't fit over my bust, but it wasn't too distracting to look at, just a little irritating. But even with that - this is the greatest dress. The bell sleeves and the v-cut backwere a fun a addition - almost purchased it, and cannot wait to rent it again.","September 11, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP54","RTR Customer","A Cool North GA Mountain Wedding","This was a great dress for this wedding. I knew the temperature would be on the chilly side and this dress did a great job. It was very comfortable. It was a bit shorter than I was hoping and I did fight with the lining at the bust quite a bit. I found it easier to pull the lining up above the bust rather than trying to keep it flat which produced a faint line across the bust. I did receive quite a few compliments. Though this dress was great I probably would not rent it again. I typically wear between a size 6 and 8 and ordered both the 42 and 44. The 44 was a much better fit for me. I did have to wear some foundations under it to help with unsightly panty lines.","March 21, 2019","True to Size"

It's really warm tho so keep that in mind if you're a dancing wedding guest. The sleeves are a nice detail since the dress is very plain.

I received tons of compliments but the fit for both the 38 and 40 were off. The 38 did not hit me at the bust correctly. The seams for the bust line were above my armpits which created a very faint crease at this area. The 40 fit me at the bust but was too baggy on me. I went with the 38 for the wedding. The material is awesome and could be worn in a cool or warm climate wedding. The dress was also a little more pale and short than I expected. Overall, I was happy with my dress but I don't know if I would rent it again based on how great I felt in other dresses I rented from RTR.","September 23, 2018","Wedding"

It's important to wear bras that don't have lace that are smooth with this dress, since the lace will show through. Otherwise, the cut hugs the body at all the right places. I got so many compliments all day long. Since it was a coworker's wedding, I heard even more compliments after returning to work (it was memorable).

It would probably have been a little too heavy for a 90-degree day, but it was perfect for a rainy August day. It's a lightweight, thinner scuba material and was very wrinkle resistant and comfortable. Has a little stretch, but not super forgiving. It was perfect for church because of the modest boat neck, but I also thought it looked great worn backwards for more of a v-neck cut. Great peach color, and appropriate length.","August 13, 2018","Wedding"
