It sits right at the smallest part of my waist and I love the asymmetrical hem. It's very light and flowy but still flattering. The shower was postponed, so I didn't actually wear it out of the house.","March 21, 2020","Other"

It fits perfectly, is incredibly flattering, and the color is absolute perfection if you want a bold moment. It is elegant thanks to the gorgeous neckline and chic material, but also flattering and figure hugging. Could not recommend this showstopper enough!","March 19, 2020","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ADP96","Nicole","Amazing Look","This is the it outfit for clean lines but giving a lot of attitude. Crisp white and the perfect length for 5'4. I wore it with flats during quarantine life and wished others could see how well it flowed. I normally where a 14 but sized up to make sure this was comfy and it was perfect; gave a bit of a dress look overall with the comfort of a jumpsuit.","April 22, 2020","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ACH6","Kathryn","Felt very lady like spring time dress","The size 6R is = to 2R. It fit well but not much extra room. The details are exceptional. Didn't think I'd like until I actually had it on. And the material is so soft that I wanted to keep it on. The cut out in the back is sexy and sophisticated.","April 17, 2020","Small"

I ended up loving it! I belted it and that made it a little more stylish but it also looked cute without a belt. I loved the pockets! I will definitely rent this again.","February 14, 2020","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALSH5","Erin","Whimsical, flattering, and sexy","This dress was perfect for the formal/tropical wedding I was attending in Miami. The straps were very long, not adjustable and because of the sheer bodice, it was challenging to pin them shorter. It fit me well enough I didn't have to pin it, but it would have been a little more comfortable if they could have been adjustable. I'm smaller chested so the bodice wasn't a problem for me, but if you had a larger cup size it might be challenging. Overall loved it.","March 15, 2020","True to Size"

It was full length on my 5'0 frame but I knew in my head I wanted to wear boots with it so that was fine. I sized up to a 10 for my boobs and it was perfect, a little extra room, not too tight.

My my hips looks huge and although I have hips I wouldnt call myself a ""hippy"" person. Was not flatter at all. I also have bigger boobs and the way it sat overall looked terrible.

I usually wear a medium or size 8 (closer to a size 10 than a 6.) After checking out the size chart, I determined the appropriate size for me was XL. I was thrown off by this but ordered it anyway since I'm unfamiliar with the brand and figured it must run super small. Skirt arrives, and it's huge. Clearly the right size for me would have been my normal size, a medium. It did seem to be very cute though if it had been the correct size!","February 9, 2020","Large"

I ordered a medium because I’m usually a 6, but i think even if I went a large this just wouldn’t have been a good fit for my shape. If you’ve got a booty, beware of this skirt. It was pretty much impossible to get over my backside. Once I finally did get it on (pretty much a workout in itself) because of how tightly it stretched across by booty, it pulled the hem up in the back and it stuck out like I had a tail. From the front it was perfect, but it had to work way too hard to fit in the back. Overall, it was beautiful, but not a fit for me.","March 6, 2020","Small"

I loved the shape of it and the pattern on the fabric. The fabric is thin though so I'd recommend a warm climate for this piece. I rented a Small because XSmall wasn't available, unfortunately it was far too long and very large in the booty but fit well elsewhere. I'm going to try the XS and see if it's suitable but I worry it will still be too long. Otherwise a very cute and fun little outfit.","January 1, 2020","Date"

It is sooooooooooo comfortable and being tall, sometimes rompers and jumpsuits can look and feel odd if they don't fit my torso, but this was a gem and I highly recommend it for tall people.

Like impossibly long. I'd say if you're 5'8"" and up and have some heels, you'll rock this. To cope, I pinned the bottoms to look like joggers and then tucked the pins up under the leg against my ankle. It worked like a charm. However, it would look nicer straight legged like it's supposed to be. Still loved it!","January 7, 2020","Vacation"

The 4 fit like a glove ( I was deciding between a 4 or 6). I'm a 34 C and felt like the bust part of the dress was still gaping a little bit so I used these boob inserts I got from Nordstrom rack.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL277","Rebecca","Stunning, unique dress, perfect for curvy girls!","I absolutely loved wearing this dress! I felt strong, elegant, beautiful, and unique. The fabric is a beautiful velvet lace that is thick and holds you in. The corset look adds a sexy touch. You can definitely wear a strapless bra with this and would work for larger chested girls. I'm normally a 12 but ordered a 14 as so many nice dresses require sizing up - but i could have worn a 12 and it would have been fine and defined my shape more.

I normally wear a 4 and I wore a 4 in this dress, though I got a 6 as backup. This dress fit well in the body, though it was longer on me than it is on the model, because I am on the shorter side. The only drawback was that the bow-straps on this dress don't actually untie, so you can't adjust the straps. These became a bit painful on my shoulders when I sat down and the dress pulled. Nothing major, but something to keep in mind if you'll be sitting all night. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this beautiful dress!","March 6, 2020","True to Size"

The fabric on this was thinner and silkier than expected, but great quality & nice to wear. Fit is true to size & perfectly tailored. The slight mock neck helps balance out the short length a bit, but I took a star off because this dress did require frequent adjusting. Not only is it short (I'm only 5'4""), but the ruching at the side causes it to ride up when walking. If it were 2-3"" longer it would have been perfect! Rent anyway!","November 11, 2019","Work"

I probably could have gotten the short sizes instead of the regular, I'm 5'5"" and wore 3"" heels and it was still almost too long.

I was going to wear the 18L but found another dress I liked better on RTR. The dress is gorgeous. I was just worried, ultimately, that I would trip or it may fall in bodice while dancing.

There is so much fabric in the pleated skirt that I want to spin in it all day. It's comfortable and flattering. My issue with this dress is how long it is on me -- the longest part of the dress rests at my ankles, and the sleeves fall into puddles around my wrists. Since the cuffs are nicely fitted and the dress isn't touching the floor, I don't have any problems wearing it, but it definitely does NOT look like the mid-calf dress in the model's picture. I won't dock stars for this because it's so pretty and easy to wear, but fellow short people may want to be aware of the fit.","April 16, 2020","Large"

It's made from a really soft T-shirt type of fabric and has pockets. I could have easily worn a small or extra small. Part of the beauty of this dress is the neckline in the front in the back. However that's also its downfall. The straps were so stretchy I couldn't get them to stay up & was preoccupied w flashing someone all night ;( I am small chested so I went with some little pasties-this is def not for anyone who needs support or a bra.","October 15, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF48","Jennifer","Not a great fit for my shape.","This one was a bit weird. It's a stretchy jersey material which makes it a little less formal. I didn't find the straps to be too overly stretched out, but the fit is weird. I'm small chested and would have preferred to wear a bra with this but couldn't because of the very wide and low neckline combined with the clingy material - every lump and bump is visible on top so a bra is a no-go. I'm curvy on bottom and even with shapewear the pockets bulge strangely, which drew unnecessary attention to my hips. If you're less curvy on bottom and comfortable sans bra, this may work for you!","March 10, 2020","True to Size"

The material is thinner than expected so if it's tight on you I imagine it could be a bit see through. The reason I didn't wear it was the straps are so ridiculously long and you can't adjust them. I have a very long torso and normally find straps too short. Don't think I've ever found straps to be too long, in fact! It's also very chesty- if you aren't comfortable showing lots of cleavage this isn't a good option for you.","February 25, 2020","Party"

I ended up with four dresses to chose from. Every one of them was too short for me. I am only 5'6"" and was wearing 3-inch heels. This dress was a tad too short with 3-inch heels. I think the back of the dress is supposed to trail behind a bit like a train. Orginally, I rented the 6R and the 8R and the 6R couldn't be sent at the last minute. I could have used the 6L for sure. The 8R worked, but the top was a bit big. I could pinch an inch of fabric at the waist.

I am 5'5"", 135 lbs, I wear a 34A, I wear a small in tops, just for reference. I had to wear my highest platform heels(4-5 inches) to compensate for the length, which probably hit the floor about 1/2 an inch.

The neck line of the dress creates a flattering halter-top line effect that accentuates the collarbone and shoulders and the slit up the dress went up at the perfect length - not too showy but enough to make it sexy. And the opaque band across the torso was positioned so that my belly button wasn't showing. I highly recommend this dress for anyone who wants an elegant look but with a peak of skin here and there.","December 10, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FEA3","Kim","Unique and flattering","I wore this for my husband's company holiday dinner. The 2 fit but was tight in the arms and waist -- there is NO stretch in this dress at all. Since I would be sitting and eating, I opted for the 4 and it was the perfect compromise between fit and movement. I did have to put some tape inside at the bottom of the boning in front so it didn't dig into my waist while sitting, but it worked like a charm. TONS of compliments and a great pattern for a holiday party. It's really different but festive. The material is a bit satiny, so I went with silver jewelry and blue and silver shoes, which matched the blue perfectly. I'm only 5'1"" so the dress hit me just above the knee which was just right. My only complaint is that the boning in the bodice was a bit uncomfortable. The lining is a bit thin, so you can feel the top and bottom edges through the fabric.","December 18, 2019","Small"

The 12 little loose in the behind, but I have broad shoulders, so think i needed that size for the top part. The sleeves didn't go all the way to wrists-but still looked fine.

It's also shorter than I expected, but at 5'9, that tends to happen. It was a total stand out though! The neckline, the trendy pattern, the gathered skirt. I got compliments all night!

The boning poked through the fabric on the inside, so it kept poking me. Also, the buckle for that draped embellishment in the front was no longer attached.

It was pretty, but definitely geared for more slender body type. The 6 would have fit except the shoulders and arms were extemely tight. I am athletic so I have some more curves in those areas. I also could not raise my arms past shoulder height or keep them bent for longer than a few seconds even though the shoulders on the 8 were too large on me as the fabric has zero stretch.

I paired it with black booties, hot pink earrings and hot pink lipstick to match some of the florals as well as a black moto jacket for when the temperature dropped. It hit my legs pretty low – at the ankles – so I kind of let the dress ride up so it didn't hit me on my booties started but rather a bit higher so there was some skin showing between where the dress ended and the booties started. Since the dress has ruching, it didn't look bad if it rode up, plus the ruching is very flattering for your figure and midsection.

One callout - beware the neckline! The photo is deceptive - it actually went as low as about an inch above my bellybutton (especially when sitting).

Otherwise the material is very breezy for a summer wedding in Texas, it's comfortable and has POCKETS!!!

It does draw attention to the bust (but I am a 36D) and it nicely minimizes hips (I am very pear shaped). I would normally order the XL or 14 and although the Large fit me, it is clingier to the hips and booty instead of flowy as was intended. Still looks good, but if I had a choice, I would prefer it more flowy. If you are straighter through the hips you could probably size down. Material isn't exactly sheer but you do need nude undergarments or they will show through because it is very thin.","April 8, 2019","True to Size"

I received a lot of compliments and would rent it again. It's kind of a modern take on 80's style, the material hanging from the back right shoulder is such a sassy little addition. However, it runs small. Also, it's tricky because the front/top is conservative, but the high slit and split back makes it less so.

No zipper, so you have to pull it over your head or step into it (might be challenging for someone with big hips/butt). The straps are pretty wide on the shoulders, and kept falling down no matter how snug I made them (straps are adjustable). The scoop neck is really feminine, but I was constantly worrying about the front dropping low and my bra cups showing (I did eventually use fabric tape and it was better). My biggest concern was that the slip under the sheer, velvet material is SO SHORT. The slip literally stopped at my butt. Fortunately, the velvet material is only partially sheer, but when I sat down, the slip was basically at my stomach. I'm 5'9"" and 160 lbs, size 36B for bust.

Unfortunately I was unable to wear this dress for my husband's business Christmas party because the size Small I ordered was replaced with a Medium. I ordered an XS and a S but received an XS and a Medium. The Small would have fit perfectly, but I could have gotten away with the XS or the Medium. The XS straps were just too tight because they hit in a weird spot on my shoulders (they are positioned farther out than normal camisole type straps) and the lining and dress seams were bulky and did not lay flat. The Medium was a tad bit too loose in the chest (I am small busted) but it would have worked OK with some fashion tape. Because the Medium was overall a bit too loose, it was baggy at my lower back and just looked to big on me because of it. I will certainly give this dress another shot in a Small.

I don't have big boobs and didn't find the chest area too big but my rib cage is probably on the bigger side. Only potential negative is the inner slip comes to mid thigh since there's a slit on the right side and it can ride up when sitting but it's sewed to the dress so chance of actual wardrobe malfunction is low.","November 25, 2019","Wedding"

The detailing is gorgeous and the colors were fantastic for a fall wedding. That said, the slip lining is very short (my shape wear was longer than the slip) and a little flimsy and the straps felt very fragile and thin, and like many others point out the chest is very, very large. I am a 40D with a wide back and it was hard to keep it up so I can only imagine someone with a smaller chest.

The sizing was extremely odd. The slip is VERY short and I felt like I kept having to pull it down all evening... thankfully the lights were dim all night long! The fit of the dress was very baggy all around and did nothing for my body. I looked larger than what I am. The only thing I liked about this dress was the slit on the leg... gave me some sort of shape when walking. Since I wanted to love this dress I still wore it to the wedding but I paired it with a black leather jacket and never took it off. I do not recommend unless you are very thin but also have boobs to fill it out. I must have readjusted this dress 100x that night and it still felt off... :(","November 5, 2019","Large"

The one downside is for larger busts -- the bust area is super unstructured with the slouchy look, so if you bend over the girls are very liable to fall out. I didn't wear a bra with this dress, so had to be super conscious of that while dancing.

Great if that's the look you want but not appropriate for what I needed it for. The fabric of the dress is pretty though the colors do give it a retro feel, more blue and orange than I expected.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR105","Hannah","Stunning, flattering, SPARKLY","I LOVED this top. I'm considering buying it because I miss it. It is incredibly flattering, highlights your collar bones beautifully, and really catches attention. It is soft velvet with small sparkles (I thought they were white dots from the pictures, but they are silver sparkles). There is boning in the sweetheart neck, so it keeps shape. With that said, here are the cons. - The sleeves slip down your shoulder a bit. No biggie though. - Busty girls beware! It is hard to wear a bra and my sticky bra just looked wrong under the shirt. I had to wear a strapless, barely padded bra. - I loved the asymmetrical hem, but my roomie thought it was weird. If you don't like it, you can tuck it under though","January 8, 2020","True to Size"

The asymmetrical bottom was fun with black jeans, and the multi colored metallic shimmer was great for a party. The only downside was that the back is extremely see-through, so if you don't want your bralette/bra to show you need stickies or a jacket. I rocked a black bra under and thought it was fine. It is a little snug in the arms so if you are muscular maybe size up","February 14, 2020","Party"

The lace is thick and looks high end in combination with the chiffon. Loved the overall look. Everything fit well for a petite girl - I can see this being short on a regular height person. However, there is no give to the waist band. It was very tight - but I could still sit and breathe, and since the next size up was too big - I ended up just wearing the 4. I was still able to dance and eat in this dress. Def would recommend trying two sizes.","March 18, 2020","Wedding"

Reformation sizing tends to run on the smaller size and I normally would wear a 4 or 6. But I waited too long and was desperate so had to make do with a size 8. Fit from the bust down was good, but bust and up was too big. Had to use a lot of double-sided tape to keep things decent since the neckline was a bit low. In spite of the slightly awkward sizing/fit in the shoulder/bust area I still got a ton of compliments and would rent again in the right size!","November 7, 2019","Party"

I do have very narrow shoulders but my chest is a 32 DD so it's rare when both the shoulders and chest area are big. I def had to wear a camisole underneath, but it still looked amazing.

This dress has zero stretch. My husband had to zip me in and it was a struggle. Plus, the V-neck is fairly deep so I had a little more cleavage than expected for a family wedding (and my girls are rarely out on display). Otherwise, I loved the puff sleeves and the length was surprisingly good for my 5'3"" height. I felt pretty, but next time I'll remember to order 2 sizes.

It was gorgeous and very forgiving to my aging body, but here are the adjustments I'll have permanently done to my own dress: 1. Put a snap or hook at the cleavage. 2. Put a snap or hook at the leg area, to keep the dress from flying open. 3. Tighten the wrist opening so that the sleeves don't fall past my hand. At 5'2"", the hem hit me about an inch above the knee--which was just right. The ""skirt"" portion flounces out just a little, which is the perfect foil for a larger waist.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSK52","RTR Customer","glam, comfy, show-stopper","This was so soft and comfy on the inside, none of the usual issues w beading and glitter rubbing your armpits raw! It is stretchy and moves so well while being structured at the top. Length is a little odd, I'm 5'6"" and it was right at my ankle. If I owned it I would have gotten it taken up a few inches or let down a few inches. One con is you have to unzip the back zipper to go to the bathroom; maybe if you had super narrow hips you could get it off w/o unzipping but the waist cinches in so idk if that would be possible. All-in-all perfect for a cocktail work party, felt amazing and got tons of compliments!","December 21, 2019","True to Size"

I put this on and immediately knew this was the one for my 40th birthday party! It was so special and I knew I would regret it if I didn't go for it! Incredibly comfortable to wear all night for a big dinner and dancing! I got so many compliments from everyone. If I could find a good occasion I would definitely wear it again.

I ordered it with no plans in mind, and ended up wearing it for Halloween (dressed up as a love child between Gaga and Miley) and will wear it to a friend's birthday. The only downside is that it sheds glitter EVERYWHERE. I'm still vacuuming up glitter. I have no problem with my life being perpetually glittery, but my fiancé isn't excited about it...just make logistical plans for this jumpsuit and you'll be solid.","November 12, 2019","Party"

I got this for my birthday and received so many compliments. I felt fantastic in it - it was comfortable, easy to move and dance in, and the long sleeves were helpful since it was chilly out! The pattern of the jumpsuit is so dynamic, a video would much better demonstrate how it twinkles. I chose the 2R because it fit better throughout. I'm 5'11'' so the 4T was a better length but it didn't make a huge difference.","November 6, 2019","Party"

You will shed glitter, but maybe this had been rented enough times before me, that definitely wasn't a big issue.

But one thing I do want to point out - I am short, about 5'2"". If you do not have a standard height high heel, I think I wore a 4 inch heel, it will touch the ground in the back. I picked this dress specifically because I am short, and it does appear to be more of an ankle length dress in the photos, but for us short girls it will go to your heels! Nevertheless, this is the most stunning dress I have ever worn, and it truly made my night so much better since I felt so confident.

The stomach area is a little unforgiving in this style and the bottom of the dress can overwhelm if you are much shorter than 5'2. The straps were adjustable but surprisingly flimsy.

The thick fabric hides any discrepancies in fit as well as any underwear type I tried on with it. It had a built in bra which worked wonders.

The 10R was too small in the bust but would have fit otherwise, so I wore the 12R instead. The fabric is absolutely beautiful, and I loved how the hem draped. I did have issues with the straps that other reviewers mentioned - the amount of cleavage showing definitely increased throughout the night as the straps loosened.

(Lol) considered buying the dress that's how much I loved it! If you're curvy it will definitely fit really well. I was hesitant thinking it might not look good but it looked so darn good. my only complaint would be that the straps loosened throughout the night and had to be continually tightened.

It made me look slimmer which is always a bonus. The material was super soft and the dress was comfortable to wear for 7 + hours! The only compliant I have is that although you can tighten the straps they would come loose and I would need to have them pulled tighter. This wasn't a big issue except for the fact that I have a large chest and it showed more cleavage then what I would of preferred for the setting I was in.","March 2, 2020","Formal Affair"

I was flooded with compliments all night. I usually wear a 6 so I got the 6 and 4. It's pretty TTS. The 4 cinched the waist a bit more so I went with that. I have no bust but it has a built in corset and buckle beneath the zipper to keep you in place. The asymmetrical ruching is super flattering and the puffy off the should sleeves are so flattering. The sleeves do not inhibit arm movements. The only annoyance was the white string to hang it up would sneak out of the top of the sleeves. I wore a strapless bra to help look more feminine. Because I sized down it was a little tight using the restroom but I made it work. I styled it a bit vintage with a t strap shoe, large earrings and a simple hair style.

It's as soft and comfortable as a casual jersey dress, but looks SO great. With the deep-plunge sheer panel in the front, you can't wear a regular bra, which I was expecting, BUT I'm small-chested and used to not having to wear any kind of bra with a formal dress that has a bit more structure in the top. You can't get away with that here, because there just isn't any structure, so plan for that! That softness and flexibility gives you some room in the size, though. I wore the smaller of the two that I got, but wondered if I could have fit into even one more size down.","March 4, 2020","Large"

The fabric is soft and has quite a bit of give so it fits nicely everywhere. I wore a nude/glitter bra that blended well with the sheer panel on the front. The sleeve length is the only slightly odd thing about this dress (sort of hits about 2 inches above the wrist), but I would strongly recommend this stunning dress for any formal or cocktail party.

I wound up wearing the 44 because the band around the middle has no give and the 44 was a little more comfortable, but I think the 42 would have been ok. It's slimming and the perfect mix of edgy, classy, and sexy. The fabric is really soft and shimmery and despite being thin, it's suprisingly warm. It was a chilly evening and was still warm enough.

I wore it to a wedding in Napa and got so many compliments! The arms and front v-neck are see through, but that adds a great dimension to the dress!

It’s made out of a polyester/nylon blend, so it feels great on, but the flowing skirt, sparkly details, and sexy low neckline give it an fun elegance that had me getting compliments on it all night long. I’m short (5’1), so the dress hit at low shin, above the ankle for me, but I didn’t mind that. The heels I paired with it offset that. I was worried that my larger bust (32DD) with no bra would make it too sexy for a work holiday party, but the sheer deep V is a darker mesh, so it’s not that obvious.

Thicker thighs and a booty & a smaller torso. The dress itself is kind of hard to figure out how to put on with the straps crossing in the back (needed some assistance from a friend-ha!), but once it is on, the chest area can be totally customized to your needs. The shoulder straps and the back straps are adjustable, allowing it to fit exactly as you need. I have a small chest, so I was able to get away with just nipple covers, but there were times where I had to be careful- the cowl neckline gaped open so had the opportunity for a nip slip a couple of times. I also wore spanx with these - I have the SUPER high-waisted ones, so i had to roll them down and be conscious of that everytime I went to the restroom - otherwise they would be showing in the back. All in all, small prices to pay for such a great dress! It was a show stopper and I received so many compliments on it.","March 3, 2020","True to Size"

That being said, it can be a liiiiiitle tricky to get into (the back straps can be tight). If I had any sort of bosom at all, I probably would've sized up, so keep that in mind. The color is beautiful, and it shockingly wasn't super long on my 5'3"" frame! I'd even say it was proportional to the model in the RTR photos — truly a fashion miracle! CONS: silky fabric will show all your lumps and bumps. I'm wearing it with a control-top thong to smooth out the lower belly. I can't even make sticky boobs with with this! Instead, I'm going completely braless...no pasties or anything. Even the pasties would flash a little. Be forewarned, if you have no chest, you probably can't wear a bra and you'll need a tiny hint of fashion tape to avoid any nip-slips.

It went about four inches below my knee which was great because I think it balanced out the revealing back and front. Pros: Sexy, simple, and elegant. A beautiful red; great for Valentine's Cons: You NEED fashion tape for this dress unless you're okay being cognizant of your breasts all night. I was committed to wearing it without but that meant I had to tighten the straps all the way (which kind of created a fat bulge on my back in some angles) and even then I had to make sure not to lean in too far or bend down.

As some of the other reviews have already said, it is a tad bit shorter than expected and not sure if this is overvalued.

I definitely could have used a size 6, despite having a 36G bust. Either way, this is such a fun and comfortable dress. I wore it to a New Year's Eve party and although EVERYONE wore sequined dresses, this one really stood out. Paired it with fishnet stockings, black knee boots, and red lipstick for an ultra-sexy flair.","January 5, 2020","Party"

I ordered the 2 & 4. I preferred the fit of the 2 as it was a little more fit (the top through the chest is meant to the a little loose) but it was quite short so I wore the 4. The 4 worked really well and wore more like a t-shirt dress. I was super comfortable all night! 128, 5'6"", 32ddd","January 1, 2020","Party"

The color ranges from blue to more of a teal depending on the light. I wore it to a January wedding in Florida, and the velvet material was still comfortable in the upper 70's temps. I'd definitely recommend it for pear shapes like myself, as it hugs on the bottom but the looseness on the top balances you out. If you're more of a straight & narrow shape I'd probably size down to an XS, but the small worked for me since I'm bigger in the hips where it's snug. In terms of length, I'm 5'5"" and the regular just dusted the ground without heels. I wore 3"" heels and it still worked fine, but if you're any taller than me I'd go with a long. There's an open/keyhole back so you can wear sticky bra or I was totally comfortable just going braless with the thick material. Overall highly recommend!","January 22, 2020","True to Size"

So flattering! The only thing I wished was different was the length. I'm only 5'4"" and the regular just barely hit the floor while barefoot. I usually wear 4"" heels when going out but had to wear way shorter heels so it didn't look too weird with the dress not touching the ground.

It was comfortable and I got a ton of compliments. I felt great in it, but definitely made my upper body look bigger than I am. I think it looks and fits better than it photographs! Highly recommend","November 26, 2019","Wedding"

RTR was FANTASTIC and overnighted this dress to me in a size XL. I was SUPER worried it wasn't going to fit because I am a curvy girl with a big booty and hips but when the dress arrived, it was HUGE on me. The description of this dress said the XL was a size 10 but it was more like a 14/16. RTR again overnighted me this dress in a size L and it fit perfect! Sizing is more as follows: XS 00/0, S 2/4, M 6/8, L 10/12, XL 14/16. Dress also has stretch so for you curvy girls out there, don't be afraid of this dress! This dress is now extra special to me as my boyfriend surprised me at his birthday dinner by proposing-one of my favorite dresses! I paired the dress will sparkly silver shoes and bag but you can also do nude color shoes. Dress is very light pink/purple color so hard to color match to a colored shoe.","February 10, 2020","Large"

The size was a bit more roomie than I typically like or need (I'm usually between a 2 or 4), but I still loved this dress and so did my partner! It's a very thick material, which didn't feel like it would be too hot, just sturdy.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ELT84","RTR Customer","The prettiest asymmetrical dress so far!","When I first received this dress in the mail, it came out to be a little more mauve-toned than blush pink. Wasn't a problem for me, but threw me off a bit. I love, love the asymmetrical design on the front of the dress. It's different, feels botanical, and overall perfect length for the colder seasons. The only problem I had with this dress and I'm pretty sure with non-fitted dresses are the cup sizes!! I've worn strapless dresses and they either make me look like I have something or don't have anything at all. There are shapers on this dress to cover those girls, but for A cups - MAN, it sucked. Even when I wore a bombshell bra from VS. There was still that gap that didn't want to be filled in. I tried on a SMALL and MEDIUM. The small almost had a bigger cup for me, but was too tight on the waist for me and I don't have that much of a flat stomach, so it was kind of protruding a bit. The medium had a better cup for me, but felt too loose on the waist. It was an odd feeling in a dress. So sadly, I never wore this dress to the wedding as I anticipated. But it's a lovely dress and will have to rent out again when I fill out, I guess. Hahaha.","January 9, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF323","Alice","Great piece, color and style.","Loved the color and pattern as well as the crop. There is a lot of material so had a tough time figuring out how to tie it just right to maximize look and reduce all the fabric at my waist. Fun piece though!","January 19, 2020","Date"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF323","Nicole","Amazing Fun Print for Gay Best Friends BDAY","This top is low cut, sexy, and flattering in the tummy as well as the arms. The ruching detail distracts from bigger arms which is nice. The fabric is thick enough and long enough for decent coverage on the stomach. I opted for high waisted jeans. Lots of compliments!","December 8, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF323","Claudia","Gorgeous top, just too crop top for me","Beautiful and thought I may be able to get away with high waisted jeans (maybe I could have paired with a slip dress underneath?) But it was just more tummy than I cared to show. But don't let that stop you - it's stunning.","January 6, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF323","Lauren","very trendy but a little fussy","I actually didn't end up wearing this because it was too fussy for the occasion and I felt I would have had to keep adjusting the top through the night. Very cool though and fit true to size - just takes some finessing to get it to not expose everything.","January 2, 2020","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF323","Lameka","cute top, will likey rent again.","The fit was overall good. I'm a bit busty, so was a little more cleavage than I anticipated. But it will definitely work for a night out.","December 30, 2019","True to Size"
