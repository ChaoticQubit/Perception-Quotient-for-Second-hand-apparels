https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CD38,Dawnesha,Unflattering color,I wanted to love this but it arrived and looked nothing like the pretty gold color on the model or even the one displayed in pics. I attached pics of it under the lights to try and show it. In my opinion it's more cheap flea market gold or the color of New Years eve streamers. I did like the high neck and if I had gotten one size down the tight fit may have helped it be more flattering. Instead it fit funny and the nudeish slip underneath didn't help out my coco skin tone. Overall the up close color and pattern reminded me more of my grandmas Sunday wear then party vibe. Also the lace was torn in certain areas and the meshing at the bottom was flipped out funny so I decided to return rather then wear to a party like I originally planned. The pics of the other girls looked super cute so I'd say order on the cautious side,"September 10, 2019",Other

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CD38,Carrie,Unexpected Gem,"This dress was a selection for a last minute replacement and my friend urged me to try it. This is a style I would NEVER try on my own - I am a bigger girl with a ""generous"" chest and I thought the high neck and the lack of sleeves would combine to make me into a blobby nightmare. I WAS SO WRONG. I loved how I looked and felt in this dress. It fit with room to breathe and the skirt length was a good balance between sexy and appropriate (with tights) for a workplace wedding. The dress is lined except for the part of the dress overlying the upper chest; this allows skin to peak through and soften out that high neck. The gold overlay fabric is gorgeous and glam. I hardly noticed the lack of sleeves, and although I thought the boxy shape of the dress would only compound my boxy frame, it nipped in just enough at the waist to feel fashionable and attractive. The only problem area is the zipper in the back, which has a bit of trouble getting up through the lining and the gold lace at the waist seam. I got compliments from everyone I talked to all night and I felt fantastic. Really glad that I took a chance on this dress and will keep it in my rotation for the future.

I am a pear shape so I always rent dresses that are more free flowing below the waist and I size based on my upper half basically. Unless reviews prove for me to do otherwise. Unfortunately when I rented this dress there were not yet reviews. Before my dress shipped some reviews were in and I kept up with them seeing the dress runs VERY small. I typically wear a 4 or 6 when renting so naturally I got the sizes 1 & 2 (4-6 & 6-8). After reading the reviews I quickly changed my order to sizes 2 & 3 (8-10). STILL much too small. I could put it on and zip it but it did not hit right on my body and then the top was too loose. Basically not meant for my body type. If you are thin all over this would be great for you (but you should still size up). I blame the designer for the sizing so no hard feelings because RTR is amazing and rushed me two replacements, both of which I loved!

It obviously failed miserably (didn't help that it poured, so I also wore high boots. I know: I'm old enough to know better). I own a few HL dresses and swimsuits in XS but this ran quite small for a Small and there's no way XS could've worked. I know what you're thinking: but the fabric is so thick and tighter works better in these to sculpt and slim...but stop thinking it, because the smaller size won't zip and it will be plenty tight and supportive. Err on bigger. I'm usually a 2. Refreshingly, this wasn't at all pulled or stretched out (HL don't hold up well for the price at all - I honestly feel the similar bandage dresses in BCBG are just as flattering, tons more affordable, and hold up beautifully, but that's irrelevant). Fit: I am a mom with a gut, so definitely needed a serious girdle for the pooch in this. I was very bummed that there are totally pointless back cutouts at the straps that prohibit a regular bra. I had to wear a strapless and it still poked up in the back.

Everything about this dress is utter perfection. Quality, size, color, comfortableness, everything. I received soo many compliments on it.

The length was perfect, I wore 3 inch heels and it still reached the floor without dragging it. Spanx are recommended if you have a bit of a belly like me (I didn't wear them, but it would've looked better if I did). I have a pretty big butt and boobs and this dress still made me look elegant and less voluptuous. The slit is high, but not high enough that you'd flash anyone.

LOVE the print and the dress overall was perfect for the setting in the Catskills mountains. It was, however, almost too tight across my ribcage to wear! This was a bonus dress in a RTR promo so I only had one size; the size up would definitely have been the move. By contrast, I wore a 2R in a different dress for the actual wedding - and here the 4 was too small. Rent this dress, but size up! The print is so fun - the florals being oversize is unexpected and makes it funky. The style of the fabric almost gives it a canvas/almost denim look, and there's visible stitching as a style element, making it a little bit more on the casual side than the listing really shows.","September 27, 2018",Small

I ended up wearing it one shoulder like some other reviewers did just to give myself an extra 2 or 3 inches of length so I could dance.

The waist was too high on me, the hips were too tight and the crotch was very long. The pockets on the jumpsuit were a good idea but they sat right on my stomach and made it look lump in person. If I put anything in the pockets, you would be able to see everything. The top of the garment fit great but the bottom half was just weird. I don't think sizing up would have helped because the top would have been too big. Overall, it was a beautiful garment but the fit was very strange.

Unfortunately, it was a bit long in the torso area for me. For it to fit me well I'd have to alter it to shorten the shoulder area which would pull the whole top up. It would be perfect then. Also, it's not totally obvious from the photos. The pants have a small panel that matches the ribbon down the the leg that is on the same side as the ribbon.

It was big and flown enough that my friends through I rolled up to the birthday party in a flow maxi dress, so it worked out. If you have a short torso I would not recommend this jumpsuit. The details were cute with the floral stripe down the side and the extra material draping over the front and back of the right shoulder. I just wish it would've fit my petite frame better. The zipper was a little tough, so I wouldn't recommend wearing this jumpsuit if you are planning to drink a lot because lots of bathroom breaks could be a challenge.

This dress definitely shows every bump and bulge which isn't a bad thing if you can wear spanks.

But it wasn't easy finding a high heel 3-4 inches high. The dress is heavy material and bc it is a halter style, I feel as though I had to keep pulling up the sides and back.

I have to agree with other reviews, the cut of the bust is unusual, I should have forgone a bra and would have avoided the somewhat smushed look I saw in some pictures. I didn't feel smushed however, which leads me to believe it really is just the way the bust is cut. I was able to wear a normal bra which again I didn't need but was nice, there are snaps in the dress to keep your bra straps hidden. Nice feature. The zipper on this dress is pretty- yet industrial strength which is nice considering the fabric is pretty thick. The front did wrinkle a bit as you can see after all day sitting/standing/sitting/standing doing bridal shower things but I don't think lost its luster; the dress flairs out like that on its own by the way.

There is comfortable room in the chest so this dress is great for any cup size. There is also comfortable room in the hips because of the fit and flare style of the skirt. The dress does not have much stretch but is a very comfortable fabric. Because I am so petite at 5'3, this was more of a tea length on me hitting at my shins. I think this dress would be amazing on someone who is taller so that it will hit more at knee length. You can definitely wear a standard bra with this which is great!

However, the area around my bottom (usually size 2-4, kind of wider hips/larger bottom) was really form-fitting, as expected from this brand.

I am usually an 8 in most RTR, and I am wearing the US8 here (tag also says 12 AU size). The band below the bust should be snug, but I probably had an additional 6 inches of fabric. I also wasn't a fan of the double slits in the front. The sheer fabric would be enough sexy for me.

I found that I didn't like how you could see the snap a little when it was un-snapped, so I kept it snapped as much as possible, though sometimes it would come undone on its own.

However, I received a ton of compliments both in person and later when there was a picture of it online. So many wanted to ""borrow"" it. Wasn't expecting that. I was expecting the cold shoulder sleeve to bug me but it wasn't restrictive. A bit low cut. Didn't use Hollywood tape and it was still fine (though I'm fairly small chested).

I'm 6months pregnant and the ruffles hid what currently looks like a beer belly and the cut at the top hilighted the newfound tatas (fashion tape recommended). The print on this is more interesting than it originally appears- the flower stems are traces of legs (get it?!) and the one off the shoulder sleeve is super fun (and not annoying). The only thing I noticed was that in bright light there's one side of the dress that doesn't have a second layer/extra ruffles so it's see through (you could see my underwear pretty clearly only on that one hip), so you know, plan around that. Regardless, would rent again if I didn't already wear it twice in a row!","September 20, 2017",Wedding

It does run small and it does show any bulges, so plan on wearing spanx type undergarments and even then be careful because the size small even showed the spanx lines on me. I ended up wearing the medium. I am surprised that I would wear a medium, I'm on the smaller side and pretty fit but this is fitted and clings. The medium was a tiny bit wide at the armholes and gaped slightly but not enough to worry about. The metallic threading is nice. I wore this to a 50th birthday dance party in downtown Chicago and paired it with black suede boots so it was more fun for clubs than dressy heels, plus it was single digit temps in January that night which kept my toes warmer! I happened to have a great necklace that was black beads that was a good compliment to the dress...but the dress doesn't need a necklace. The pleats stand up and out a little and I saw the review that said it made the person feel too big. I sort of understand that, but honestly, it's such a fun part of the dress...it actually makes the dress unique, so I didn't worry about that.

I picked out sparkly silver heels that matched it so well! During the event, I was a bit nervous because the top was slightly loose and I couldn't wear a bra underneath. The material is also very see through in the bottom area, so not sure if there is any type of undergarment that won't show a little bit, and the way it clung to my stomach was kind of unflattering. I should mention that I'm petite, and this was below knee-length.

However, being 5'1 I always have the issue of clothing being big on me. I think this jumpsuit is made for somebody that's the size of a model, not somebody petite like me. The pant legs sagged. The corset fit well, but under the corset was like a poochy area where it just felt like extra fabric. So, when I sat down there was literally just extra fabric making it look like I had a huge gut. This is probably because this jumpsuit is made for somebody taller. My torso is short so this is probably why there was extra fabric. Overall, all the cons wasn't enough to not make me wear the jumpsuit. If you're very picky about fit and you're short like me, I wouldn't go with this jumpsuit.

Plus, you can never go wrong with some spanx underneath :) My uncertainty dissipated as soon as we stepped into the event (it was a debutante ball). So. Many. Compliments.

The size 6 fit like a glove. It was a very classy dress. The length was perfect . Tastefully above the knee. This dress is great for concealing the mid section and shoulders and arms. The cape part didn’t go all the way around the dress. It was just around the shoulders which was great because it made it feel less like a costume. The back of the dress looked like a regular dress. You can wear a regular bra with this dress. The dress does go up when you raise your arms so don’t wear if you plan on dancing a lot. I just wore a wrap around this to get to and from the car because putting on a coat would have been difficult. The material was heavy and perfect for a fall or winter event.

This style ran smaller than I expected with little room for stretch, so I recommend sizing up! This item it also pretty fitted at the midsection and fitted at the hips with plenty of leg room! It works best with A-C Cups as I am a C cup and was wearing a strapless bra. You could get away with not wearing a bra if that is something that you are comfortable with as well. I typically wear a Long size, but I ordered a 10R and the leg length was perfect even with wearing 3 inch heels. I am 5'7"" and the leg length fell just below my ankle as desired. I loved that this jumpsuit had a thicker material making it feel more formal for a formal event, but the style is so versatile pretty much making it perfect for a date, a night out, vacation or even to a wedding! I would definitely pair this outfit with a heel and a statement necklace, but even without, the dress itself is a statement! I am 5'7"" , weigh 160 lbs and wear a 36C bra size.

The arm movement is a bit restricting with the sleeves being attached, however unless you are dancing the 'YMCA' all night, you should get along great in this. Pockets were useful and gave my narrow hips a bit of an illusion of some curve (which was nice). The black 'lace' overlay is a cotton like material and is a flat black color. The satin underlay offers a nice pop of shine through the lace detail while adding a silky inside to the romper. It is a durable, not see-through, heavier weight satin lining.

For a size 8, it seemed to pucker in my mid-back area because I have a shorter torso than their fit model. It's really a beautiful top and would have been easy to wear if I fit it. I think someone who has a straight and narrow body type would look terrific in this. Something to note: the listing says this top is made of 100% silk. It isn't.

I tried on the XS I received as a backup size, and that was definitely snugger across the hips, but the biggest issue with the XS was that it really pulled tight and gaped across the front.

I don't think my biceps are abnormally large for my size but I do powerlift so they may be slightly bigger than average.

The cut was flattering, and I had never worn a dress like it before. It hugged all my curves and made me feel really confident. My only real issue with it was that the chest part was too big on the side that didn't have the strap. I pinned it and it was just fine, but if I hadn't the whole world would've seen my bra/half my boob. Maybe the one I got was just a bit stretched out. I ordered the size 6, but then ordered the size 4 as my back-up size. Turns out, I only received the smaller size. It was very tight, but it fit just fine. It was the right length, but I had to wear slightly shorter heels (2.5-3 inch heels) than I may have otherwise. The cut of the skirt made it a little tricky to walk in, so I was grateful for the shorter heels actually. I did get used to walking in it throughout the night, but at first it was tough. Because it was tight, I found myself having to pull it down around my hips a bit as I switched between sitting and standing. Going to the bathroom was a real event because it was so tight.

The fabric isn't clingy and the dress overall was very comfortable. I'm typically a 6/M or 8/M but went for the 6, which fit better up top. There wasn't too much of a difference across the middle. That being said, the 8 was much longer. I'm 5'4 and it touched the ground where the 6 didn't.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back-up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and at the hips. Curvier women should consider sizing up for fuller hips. It works great for any cup size and can be worn with a standard bra. At 4’8”, the length hit mid thigh on me and wasn’t too short. The cut out at the shoulders add some edginess to this otherwise simple LBD. Pair with black heels to complete your outfit.","March 23, 2019",True to Size

It met all my expectations! After reading extensive reviews, I was relieved it fit. I would have ordered the 12R had it been available, but I ordered the 8R and 10R, and the 10R still fit great!! As many other people have noted, it is VERY busty. I have a full bust so it looked very scandalous until I added a panel of fabric to cover up some of my cleavage. If this is a concern of yours, my advice would be to size up. If you size up, you should have enough fabric in the chest area to work with and pin for modesty. If you size down it will be a tighter fit in the bust, which is fine as long as you’re comfortable with a full display of cleavage. I included pictures of the dress with and without the panel for reference. As for the bra situation, depending on the way the dress sits on your back/type of bra you have, you may or may not be able to wear a bra. There are two issues you might have: 1, the strap showing in the open back, or 2, the cups showing in the front. I was lucky that dress covered my back in a way that allowed me to wear a bra without it being noticeable. You may have to explore some options between going no bra, using tape, finding a specific bra, etc. If you are self conscious about your tummy or anything below the upper body, this dress will hide these insecurities and give you a flowy hourglass appearance. As far as length, front of the dress is a bit shorter than the back, which has a bit of a train, so I wore flats. I’d say get Long option if you are planning on wearing heels and over 5ft6in. Overall, my first experience with RTR was a pleasure. Customer service was so helpful. I was even able to switch delivery addresses without a hitch last minute. Rent this dress!!

I chose it, in part, because I have a cylindrical figure and look best with a high waistline. I received loads of complements and felt lovely. I was pleasantly surprised at the high-quality of the material and the colors are gorgeous. The V-neck needed lots of adjusting during the evening to keep me modest, but was worth it. I am 5’ 9.5” and wore 3.5” heels; the “long” length was good, with one caveat. Because about ¼” of my black bra showed in the back, I tried the dress without it. Without the bra, however, the dress was just a bit longer and not safe for dancing. I put the bra back on and I expect (hope) that, because of the low lighting in the venue, this fashion breech was observed by few or none. I was a bit uncomfortable with the bare back—seemed a bit much for a 61-year-old, but I have no regrets choosing this dress. Husband gave it a big thumbs up, too.","January 1, 2020",True to Size

My work gala was in May in the Pacific NW, so I thought the heavier/darker fabric would work, but it ended up being 90 degrees out that day. Still, the dress was incredibly comfortable and only ended up feeling too hot on the dance floor (despite a couple of layers of tulle in the skirt). I'm only 5'9"" but the Long barely got to the floor, even in flats. I was happy to be able to wear flats, though! I normally wear a size 16 (occasionally a 14), but the 18 was perfect for my larger bust and relatively straight waistline. I ordered it in both a 16 and an 18, but the waist has no stretch at all and I would have felt like my back was spilling out in the 16.

I wore the 14WR and the torso zipper in the back would come undone occasionally. I would put a little black kimono over the dress when this happened. IN SPITE OF THIS... I was absolutely in love with this dress and my whole outfit. I looked stellar and felt incredible. I wore the dress with the RJ Graziano Crystal Statement Necklace. I was originally drawn to a longer necklace that would drape down the deep v, but the loose choker style of the Graziano necklace actually highlighted the deep v even more.

(I think I'm in between sizes in this designer, I rented 2 other dresses by her in a size 16 and they were too tight) It did pull at the chest when I sat down, but I was able to wear my regular bra and with some double sided tape it stayed put through dinner and dancing. I'm 5'6ish and I wore flats, I did have to lift the dress when taking the stairs. Word of warning the skit is puffy, like so much so I had to sit at the end of the isle at church because it didn't exactly fit in the pew, but honestly that was one of the things I LOVED about it.

I normally wear a size 14-16 depending on the dress. The only choice available for this was an 18L. It ran a little big in the waist area, but I was still able to wear because the flowy gown hides it. It may run a little big in the chest area for some people but it worked out well for me because I'm a 38DD. It showed a little too much cleavage so I was able to pull one side of the bust area over the other and use a safety pin that was hidden just to make it a little less revealing since it was for my husband's work event that was black tie. You'll have to wear a backless and strapless bra because of the open portion in the back. The long was perfect length for my height. I'm 5'7"" and I was able to wear heels.

If you're serious about renting this dress PLEASE READ THIS TIP: the straps are dependent on the tension in the cups!! The more you fill the cup space, the more securely this dress will hold your boobs. Please look at the model and how the straps criss cross and wrap around to form the bodice! I ended up wearing the 0 when I normally wear a 2 BECAUSE the dress is fitted in the torso, not your hips! I felt safer and less likely to spill my goodies in the 0.

I was worried about the top being so low cut as I'm a 34c/32d but as long as you have double sided fashion tape you're all good! The dress was absolutely stunning, wished I could have kept it! The only thing I will say is as someone who is on the shorter side (5'4"") with a shorter torso and hourglass my waist is small so the 2 fit almost perfect and because it was a smaller size the torso of the dress was shorter which would have helped to hold in my chest better than the size 4 which was a bit longer & definitely required tape to hold in place but because I have larger arms the 2 didn't work very well as the sleeves felt too snug so I ended up wearing the 4. If you're someone who has larger arms & a small waist/ average hips & a hard time with sleeves fitting, this dress will be no different so if 2 sizes generally fit you may need to go the larger size but rest assured they waist/hip measurement difference between the 2 sizes generally isn't too much so it shouldn't be a big deal!

Got many compliments on the dress. The curve-hugging nature and the full back made it sexy and alluring w/out looking/feeling cheap. Things to note...w/ a complete back out, wearing a bra was not possible--that was okay for this 34A, but those w/ greater bosom will want to be aware. A strapless, corset bra is possible w/ this dress, but would have to ensure that the corset has a sufficiently deep ""V"" in the back. A 2nd consequence of the back out/low back is that foundation garment options are limited--if the waist is too high, it will show in the back. The dress pairs nicely with silver accessories. I almost went w/ a silver glitter shoe, but opted instead for a navy blue suede block heel. I""m 5'8"", 148 lbs and normally wear a 6 or 8, Misses.

I have no complaints, however, about the dress itself. It fit beautifully, draped nicely, and had a very unique neck/back piece that made me feel just a little more sophisticated. As for underwear, I opted for some spanx and the chicken cutlet stick on bra (the dress is basically backless). Everything looked fab. It's nice and heavy because of the sequins and is a tiny bit lower in the back than in the front, so even through it dragged a tiny bit (I'm 5'5"" and my heels weren't very high) it wasn't hard to walk or dance in.

It’s easy to wear and if you’re concerned about showing anything accidentally then wear a bustier-type undergarment. I did not. I enjoyed this dress at a party and it never came undone, was easy to sit in. It fits your shape without being tight. This was a last minute replacement over the original jumpsuit I ordered from RTR.

I do have a large bust but the fit of this was very awkward compared to the bottom. I considered wearing it with a slip underneath to cover my chest somewhat but ended up getting another dress in time instead. This dress is pretty but 2 things: most of the sequins are matte (I ended up renting a dress with VERY shiny sequins which I loved but the leopard pattern was not apparent) and it's pretty short.

But, that would not stop me from renting or wanting to own this dress. Loved it!","December 29, 2018",Formal Affair

Initially I was torn between this and another dress I had rented because they were both fantastic.

The plunging neckline paired with midi length made this feel sexy without being too obvious. I don't know if it actually needed it but I did put a bit of fashion tape on the bust just to feel more secure.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BEC14,RTR Customer,I rented this dress for a black tie optional holiday party.,"I am a 55 year old, 5'7"" , 130 pound +/- in-shape woman. I rented this dress because at my age, I love the midi style. This dress is body conscious, but has thicker material, so you feel confident that any bulges are not that evident. The material is also a little flexible to hug you around the torso. I felt the belt was unnecessary. I normally fluctuate between a 4 and 6 and was pleased that the 4 fit me nicely. Shapewear is a must, but the slit is fairly high and my mid-thigh shapewear peaked out a bit. The neckline is plunging, but I have good cleavage and was covered up in sleeves and length , so I felt it was appropriate. I wore no jewelry other than very colorful and long earrings from Target no less! Simple and elegant and a bargain.","December 2, 2018",True to Size

I ordered a SR and an XSR as my backup. The XSR was the winner. I didn't even try on the SR because the way the XSR fit was as perfect as it would get. Because I have a small bust, there was a bit of space on the sides, so I used cutlets. It has very long legs so heels are a must. The torso area is a bit awkward in fitting as it bunches up because of the fit in the legs (maybe I should've worn the SR), but I loved it.

I'm 5'7"", and while there weren't any issues with the length, the torso length was slightly short so I wouldn't recommend that size to anyone taller than me. Note that the cape is not actually detachable. It is fully attached on one side and only detaches from the other side so that you have access to the back zipper to take it on and off. It's an orangey red, like it appears in the picture. It's a thinner material that can show lumps and bumps and you need smooth panties under it. And as you can see in the photo, you would need a special bra or to go braless to not have one showing.

I was a little concerned that I would be too hot with the thickness of the lace and the Miami heat/humidity, but this timber was perfect! -The arms allowed for lots of movement -The shorts were secure (don't bend all the way over too much b/c butt cheeks will show). -The front is lined with thick black fabric so there is no transparency if you choose to go bra-less * there is no support for breasts in this so a sticky bra/ cup only bra is needed if you choose to wear one. * I have a very small butt and narrow hips.

The top is a good fit but straps are a bit long, the waist was extremely tight (at natural waist) and then it was giant through the thigh and hip. Major sad face. Since I clearly could not pull it off a la Carter I decided to wear it to work instead with a blazer that covered the largeness in the hip/thigh. It was cute but no one even saw the back. Fabric has some stretch, wrinkles pretty easily, and is a little dramatic in the bathroom.

I have a smaller waist and could have gone with an XS as the material was a tad bit looser on me in the stomach (but then again, more room for dessert!). The top is structured and stayed in place very well, which is hard to find with an off the shoulder top. I would also note that I have a small torso, so this might be too short (in length) to cover someone's whole stomach if they have a longer torso. I did not wear a bra since the top loose portion completely covered my chest. Lastly, the top zips open completely in the back, so putting this on was super easy.

I am usually a US 6 or 8 and rented both sizes for a rehearsal dinner. Overall the fit was okay. The difference between sizes was mostly in the thighs, I had a little bit more room in them, but the top and the length remained basically the same. I am a 36C and the top fit okay, a bit loose, nothing like how it appears to fit the model. The tie on the side had a grommet you could feed one of the ties through but it prevented the wrap top from being tied tightly regardless if you used the grommet or not. The length is so weird. I am not that tall (5'6"" if I round up the half inch) and this hit me at the ankles. If it were an inch or two longer so it skimmed the top of my foot/the floor or even a couple inches shorter so it appeared more cropped it would've been fine, but it looked like I was gearing up for a flood or had an unexpected growth spurt. The length of the jumpsuit made every single pair of shoes I own look stupid. The jumpsuit is sort of boot cut so it appears skinny from the front but from the side it flares out in the back, sort of like weird dress pants. In theory this jumpsuit is really cute, and I'm sure it'll look good on petite, waif-like girls, but for me it was lackluster and I didn't end up wearing it.","May 28, 2019",True to Size

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/GRJ13,Lora,I didn't wear.,"I checked true to size because I'm not sure if I ordered it too big. I've lost a good bit of weight this past month. But, I'll give you a run down with my measurements. It's a gorgeous top. The material is stretchy and heavy so it is forgiving and it lays well on the body. They balanced the cut very well. I am pear shaped currently. (38/36/48) I ordered the XXL thinking it would fit but it's a bit too big through the bust, perfect in the waist and good through the hips. That's where the stretch came in very handy. The waist is very flattering. The color is true to the pictures and very saturated. You will stand out just the right amount. I am a 38B or 38C depending on the fabric, but even with it being a little too big it almost hit the mark. If the material wasn't stretchy & thick, I'd have been able to wear it. It's not too revealing but the top is easily positioned for a deeper V for a classy yet racy look. This top is perfect for a curvy girl with larger cup sizes. The only reason I'm returning it is due to the top being too large (for me). I'd have worn this with a pair of white or black jeggings and a strappy shoe. I'd have done gold jewelry a delicate pendant necklace and bracelet. Or for a bigger girl, a pendant with a thicker chain. I hope this helps someone. Much love!","August 23, 2019",True to Size

Also, for the retail price of this dress I really expected it to have lining -- it does not, it's a standard bandage dress. That said, as soon as I put it on I loved it! My measurements are 33-26-35, and the XS fit me like a glove, hitting in all the right places. There is short boning on the sides in the bust, and a nifty elastic strap that you hook before zipping it up (see picture). I wore it without a bra, but it did slouch a bit, even just sitting at dinner. If I were to wear it in front of anyone other than my husband I probably would've worn a strapless bra to give it a nicer shape. The first pair of underwear I tried did show some lines through it, so watch out for that, but the fabric is pretty thick so in general it's forgiving.

I'd been eyeing this dress for a while and finally had the chance to wear it out in Vegas. I didn't love it as much as I expected. The XS was too tight to wear a strapless bra with and the S was too big overall, especially the bottom half made my legs look like too tiny. The main issue is probably my bust is 32DDD plus my back and shoulders are broad so I'm probably not proportional but if you have regular boobs it should work. I think that it was pretty and classy and I pulled it off anyway, but wasn't my most flattering or comfy Herve dress I've tried on. The strapless designs can be fickle. It was cute and glad I tried it, but for the price and fit on me I would probably pass on renting it again.","August 30, 2017",Other

Glad I picked it especially, since I wouldn't normally spend this much on a rental, and also glad that my original dress worked out well; this dress was just okay to me. If I sized up, I think it would've been too large, but as is, I wouldn't have felt comfortable wearing this to a wedding for fear that one wrong bend forward would expose all of my lady parts. If I were to wear this, I'd either do more sit-ups prior and/or wear spanx (I did neither in this picture) to keep everything together and smooth.","August 19, 2017",True to Size

It's a thick dress and really sucks you in. The ombre is beautiful and flattering. I almost gave it 4 stars though, because when I was walking and ESPECIALLY when I was dancing, the back rode up and created this unflattering lump/fold on my lower back, and it didn't look good that I had to keep pulling it down.

I wore this for my rehearsal dinner held at a really nice restaurant. Definitely stunned my bridal party because nothing screams more BRIDE like this dress! Upon arrival at the restaurant, strangers sitting at the outdoor patio literally all turned and oohed and ahhed at me (not exaggerating). I was showered with compliments from strangers and wait staff as I continued to mosey inside with my bridal party. And as soon as I walked into our private party room, I was met with more oooohs and ahhs by our rehearsal dinner guests who also were amazed by my dress. I was showered with compliments all night long. So if you aren't ready to be the center of attention- because this dress definitely demands it- don't go for this dress, otherwise I can't recommend it enough! I truly felt like a bride to be in this and felt all eyes were on me (and these gorgeously massive sleeves) all night! I'm really short with an athletic build (4'11 and 130 lbs) and the sleeves on the small were impossible for my arms to fit through, so I opted for the medium back up size. It was a very form fitting and flattering fit on me that accentuated my curves and the hem stopped right above my ankles.

I felt bad for my poor sis (her dress also RTR) but this dress stole the show. I have never received so many compliments! Mostly from other women, but a few men stopped me as well. As for the dress details - at first I was unsure about it HAHA. It is A LOT of dress. It is heavy first of all. Broke the RTR hanger it came on. And I thought it possibly was swallowing me up, but in reality it actually was almost perfect. I am a small 34C and I did not wear a bra. There was definitely room for a larger chest but it was still ok on me. I am about 128 pounds, 28 inch waist 36 inch hips. I usually am between a small and medium for this designer and only got the medium. The second band of fabric hits at a very strange spot just below your hips and depending on how I stood, the fabric bulged out. I made sure to keep the dress pulled down to flatten that out. It was a great length with heels, I'm 5'4"". The sleeves were fabulous but you have to be careful eating. The dress was comfortable, but again heavy, and warm. I got a little hot inside the party room but it wasn't bad. Outside was about 30 degrees, so the dress was perfect for a short walk from valet into the casino. I'm wearing this again to Disney on Ice with my family this weekend - kind of fancy but I need another excuse to wear it before sending it ha k because it's that fabulous.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN133,RTR Customer,Did not end up wearing to the event,"I loved the dress but it didn't zip all the way up my back (directly behind my bust area), so large breasted women might want to use caution. In other dresses I can usually get the girls out of the way enough to zip, but in this gown, with the way the fabric is, the chest also effects the arm holes A LOT. It almost zipped, but even if it had I would not have been able to comfortably wear it for an evening as it was cutting off my armpit circulation. Also I do have wide hips, but the way the extra train fabric sits makes the hips look even wider than they are. It was beautiful though, nice colors and nice material. I would just think hard before renting if you are curvy/busty and size up probably 2 sizes if you are curvy. For info I have been described as an inverted triangle/top heavy. I call myself apple shape, my friends say inverted triangle. So use that info how you will!","September 9, 2019",Small

I actually wore the 4 regular not long don't know why it gave me that option but I do think I would have preferred the long because the regular did not touch the ground with my 4 inch heels and I kind of wanted that for the extra drama but I still think it looked great! The 6 fit and gave me a little more wiggle room but the bust was a little looser so went with the 4 so I didn't wear a bra. The 6 was also longer with the tight underskirt and I liked the shorter feel better with the 4. I felt so fabulous and would love to have an excuse to wear this again.

It has beautiful colors and the style is so unique. Received tons of compliments with the photos, of course our photographer also made us look good! (Shout out to Craig o'brist in Atlanta GA). The only thing is that my hips and bottom are on the larger end, so the skirt was super tight. My butt cheeks were actually hanging out some but you couldn't see it because of the long back on it. Since it was just for the photo shoot it was no problem, but if I were to have worn this at a wedding, it would of been a problem. I wouldn't have been able to dance, sit or move honestly.

My work group was the major sponsor for a charity gala and I wanted to represent my practice well. I had been to the event previously and knew it was a mix between cocktail and semi-formal. I looked for a dress that would be work-appropriate but still stun. THIS DRESS DID NOT DISAPPOINT. As everyone has mentioned before, the shiny/sparkling threading looks fantastic in person, and the way the back/""train"" flows out behind you when you walk is fabulous. It literally parts the crowd and turns heads! It made me feel like a celebrity. If you don't want all the attention on you, don't rent this dress! I seriously could not believe how many people complimented me throughout the night (it was almost surreal; I'm a sweatshirt/sweatpants kind of girl). The fit was true-to-size, but the skirt IS short. Sitting is a little risqué, but I just used the train to wrap around and cover my legs when I needed to sit. Also, the top is a little low-cut and tight, so if you have large breasts you may want to size up. I tried on the 6R and the 8P and while the 8P was a little more modest in the skirt, it gapped up top. So I just rocked the mini and went with the 6R.

I received many compliments in New York City from other women I passed at the restaurant we went to and the play The Lion King. I love the lace it is feminine yet the red color is strong. However it is extremely tight in the armpit/upper arm area almost to the point it's uncomfortable. There are also little buttons around the wrist that I left unbuttoned or that part of the arm would have been too tight too. I only got one size so I'm not sure if the larger size would have helped. My usual size is 4-6 and I wore the 4 again cause it's the only size I got, but other than the arms the rest of the fit was good. It was fitted at the waist then looser around hips- I was able to pull it up to use the bathroom. Being the material was looser bottom half it definitely didn't hold my belly in from all this vacation food, but I still felt beautiful in it. I did not wear a bra it has these two tiny little cutouts at the armpit area that add just a little cuteness to the dress. I am going to wear this again probably for Christmas pictures.

I am a long distance runner so my legs are pretty muscley, which can make dresses weird sometimes. I felt like being short I couldn't wear a long dress and with hips that I am self conscious about, I wouldn't like how this dress looked on me. I was wrong- I LOVED it. My husband loved it and all of my girlfriends kept asking me where I got it. The material is thick, which was great because it dipped into the 30s/40s that night at the ceremony after the wedding (wedding was in a Catholic Church, and I felt fine wearing this). I ordered a 4, and the 2 was a backup size. The 4 was way too big on top for me and a little too long. The 2 was perfect- and made me laugh out loud that I was even wearing a two, because that's insane. Anyway, I'll stop my rambling and tell you, if you are hesitant about ordering this dress, DON'T BE! Order it. You will love how you look and feel wearing it, and your friends will want to steal it from you ;)","March 7, 2018",True to Size

Pockets on the front and back are great and the shoulder straps were adjustable which made the fit very custom. The only thing I didn't like was that there was too much material over the stomach portion or the pleats made it seem puffy there. It wasn't noticeable by others until I sat down and it would poof out. However, I am blessed with a FLAT stomach (not as blessed on the hips and thighs) so maybe this was just a bad fit over my stomach and not a problem in most other customers.

It's a beautiful color and pattern made from a wonderful silky material. Words of caution though: if you get the petite size, it's still very long. I wore 4-inch heels and was still tripping over it at times. Also if you aren't busty, then fashion tape is an absolute must!

Breezy, comfortable, drapes nicely, and pattern is lovely and unique. Plenty of length, worn with 2.5"" heels. The only issue is the bust. It's extremely low cut. It hugs nicely enough that I didn't worry about escapage, but it was too visibly low to feel comfortable or appropriate. I ended up pinning the straps in back to get the bust where I needed it to be, which had me concerned about breaking said straps. It was manageable, but concerning. The dress was pretty enough to be worth the effort. It's also a great crossover dress: the wedding I attended was in between summer and fall, on a Sunday, formal attire - a tricky bill, and it fit it!","September 11, 2019",True to Size

Never felt overheated in it. Straps were a tad too long so I had to use one of those back bra clips which made it more of a halter type dress. As stated in other reviews, this dress is very very open in the chest area. My 38D ""girls"" were prominently displayed which wasn't the most appropriate for a wedding. I used a small safety pin in front which helped cover my cleavage a bit - but not much. The semi hidden leg slit is high! Goes to top of thigh. When I sat down my entire thigh showed. The best thing about this dress is it hid my tummy/pooch very well. I didn't need to wear spanx. Long story short, I felt beautiful and got lots of compliments, but I just don't think this is a totally appropriate dress for a wedding since it was so revealing.","May 6, 2019",Wedding

If you're renting for Vegas, FYI if you're having your rental sent to your hotel- be ready to pay another $20 in ""handling fees."" I had to pay $10 when picking up my dress at Guest Services. Also, track your package because mine arrived at the hotel 5 days early and I was worried they wouldn't hold on to it that long (luckily they did.) Also, don't bother trying to hunt down a UPS Dropbox. The most convenient place is a UPS Store at the Linq and I read before going that they also charge another $10 for ""handling"" even though the package is paid for and labeled. SO, check with Guest Services at your hotel. They will most likely send it out for you, still for the $10 but at least you'll save the trip to the Linq.","April 26, 2019",Date

I would say it fits true to size since I usually wear a 00 and there is only a size 0R to rent, if it were 0P I think it might have fit a little bit better. Because it was strapless and there wasn't any inside lining that held the top up and I was walking / standing a lot for the shoot, I did have to pull up the dress quite often even though it wasn't that heavy but also I have a small bust. The layers are gorgeous and the high low falls beautifully. I'm 5'5"", and with only kitten heels the dress barely dragged and i almost liked how it sat on the ground so i'd say the length was perfect. If you're taller / have higher heels the length shouldn't be a problem but can see it getting easily stepped on on a dance floor. The dress's is a little more of a purple undertone though still blush; the photograph on the model makes it seem like a very pastel pink.

I received a ton of compliments and felt like a princess. The leopard print wasn't over whelming and the texture and subtle shine photographed really well. I added a petticoat (just a cheap Halloween one) underneath to give it a silhouette similar to what was featured in the model pics and a beaded belt to finish off the look. The dress fits true to size in the places that matter (waist and bodice), but the bust area was large even with an extra padded bar that bumped me up to D cups. It's nothing some tape couldn't fix, but if you are going to be doing a lot of big movements in the dress on the dance floor, it's a little annoying to fix.

You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra or strapless bra since this is off the shoulders. At 5’4”, the length hit tea length in the front and floor length in the back on me.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Breana,Pretty Cute.,Wore this on a hot day for work. It was awesome. Lots of compliments. The slip it came with way WAY too tight on my bust. But all it needed was a cami under and it worked out well! I feel like it looked cuter if I bunched it up a little at my waist instead of having a drop waist.,"June 15, 2018",Everyday
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Scout,"I wore it to work, nothing special, just because I wanted to wear something pretty.","Lovely dress, so soft and flowy! It was a windy day when I wore it, so it blew up and around quite a bit, but the slip underneath helped keep me decent. I didn't find that the ruffle around the middle was a problem, I know some other reviewers said it was for them, but I thought it was feminine and cute, and it didn't seem to add any extra weight to my figure. It felt decadent, but still casual enough to wear to work (in a retail store).","May 23, 2018",Small
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Kaela,So feminine and sweet!,"All of the details of this dress are so sweet and feminine, but the dress made my hips look much wider. I loved the color and fabric and details so I wore it anyway but just pulled it up a lot to make it appear shorter since it made me look so much wider. I wear a size 0 99.999% of the time, but it made me look more like a 4...so if looking wider is something you are concerned about I would not rent. Beautiful, though!","August 22, 2017",Everyday
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,RTR Customer,Fun and flirty - perfect summer dress,I have never bought this brand before but I love it after renting this dress.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Alyssa,RTR Team Review,"What a beautiful dress! Perfect for a warm weather graduation. Was very comfortable with stretch at the waist and roomy sleeves. Would suggest sizing up if you have a larger chest, the slip was showing a bit as I have a smaller bust. Would dress up with a red lip if I rented again!","May 18, 2017",Party
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Lori,Fabulous floral!,"This dress is so pretty and light. The fabric is sheer and there is a nice separate nude slip for underneath. I loved the way it looked in the model in the photo but I felt that the little ruffle around the center made me look a bit thick (and my waist is not my problem area). However, that being said it is a nice dress and extremely feminine.","May 7, 2017",Party
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Andrea,"Easy, cute dress. Runs large.","This dress was perfect for a work event I was hosting. I ordered the small, and wished it was the XS. The slip and the blue over dress aren't connected and I found myself adjusting my cleavage throughout the night so my slip wasn't showing. The waist is stretchy and I would recommend sizing down, this dress can be worn with a regular bra and undies. Very cute even though it was too big!","May 6, 2017",Large
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Erika,Island vibes!,"I rented this to bring along on vacation, for going out to dinner. I listened to other reviews and sized down... XS was perfect for me and I'm usually 4/6. Plenty of room in the elastic waist and hips. The sheer over layer is a beautiful flowy sheer fabric with many pretty details. The under layer was way too tight in the bust for me but fortunately I had one from another dress I could wear. I would not have been able to wear the one that came with the dress. So happy I rented this and would rent again!","April 21, 2017",Vacation
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,A,Beautiful soft and flowing print dress,M was slightly big for a size 8. Pretty blue print that is perfect for spring. There is a nude underlining. I love the gathered waist and loose top and buttons. The slightly shorter length at the front makes the dress move nicely when I walk. Very comfortable and would rent again.,"April 17, 2017",Vacation
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Roxana,RTR STYLIST REVIEW,This dress was a surprise! I loved it so much! The elastic waistband made this dress so comfortable and easy to just slip on. It does run a little big so I would suggest going down as your backup dress. There was plenty of room all around the dress. The sheer material ruffles make this dress fun and girly and can be dressed down or up.,"March 28, 2017",Large

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,RTR Customer,"Feminine, pretty dress!","I got this as a replacement for a dress that was too small. I felt like this fit a little bit big, and wasn't sure how flattering it was as a result, but I loved the uneven hem (slightly shorter in the front and longer in the back). The color was a beautiful shade of blue with nice detailing.","April 29, 2019",Large

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Erin,Gorgeous. Flirty and flowy. Perfect for a summer afternoon event.,As others described the nude slip will show a bit in the v of the dress. I personally like the little flash between the buttons. Plus the slip isn't adjustable so it is going to happen. The dress looks pretty and delicate. Would definitely recommend for a summertime event.,"January 30, 2019",True to Size

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Dani,So pretty and comfy!,This dress is lovely.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL6,Julianne,Sound of Music Vibes,"Definitely felt sound of music vibes in this! Agree that is isn't the most flattering cut (on likely anyone) but nevertheless wore often. Did not use slip as it only added extra fabric and truly wasn't a very sheer dress. It's very pretty in the color and aesthetic of it, but not to show any shape (top is blousy and tends to make you look larger than you are) still loved!","August 27, 2018",Everyday
