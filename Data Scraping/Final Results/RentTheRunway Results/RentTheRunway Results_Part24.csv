"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VVB23","Kristina","Looks okay but nothing special. True to size and light summer skirt.","Fits true to size (I'm a 2/4 and in this I wore a 6 which is the equivalent of a 2). Fabric is a little see through. Looks cute and classy but nothing I'm in love with or would rent again.","July 6, 2019","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VVB23","Hannah","Not fitted in the waist","This is a beautiful skirt, but it is not fitted at the waist. If you are looking for a skirt to sit fairly low on your waist, go with your regular size (British sizing, I'm a 4 and ordered an 8). I really wanted to wear this with a nice blouse from RTR but because the waist isn't fitted, I didn't get the popover effect I wanted, so I didn't end up wearing it. I may try going down a size and wearing it higher up. Length was fine on me, but 5'3.5""","July 2, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VVB23","Tara","SO frumpy - couldn't wear","It's pretty rare for me to strike out on my rentals but this was a no-go and I sent it back right after trying it on. I should've read the reviews beforehand. Even with the British sizing, the skirt runs large and is super frumpy (Ie i'm a size 0, equivalent UK 4). The skirt sits at the lower part of the stomach accentuating any pooch area, and is wide with excess fabric on the hips. Does not look tailored at all. Very surprising for a Victoria Beckham piece.","March 4, 2020","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VVB23","RTR Customer","Too awkward to wear","Though this brand runs really small, ordering up to the size recommended by the site ended up being gigantic. If the sizing were correct, maybe the odd overlapping fabric would have looked better, but trying this on the odd lengths of overlapping squares and half a cinched belt (which was super tricky to even get looped) was TOO awkward for me. I didn't end up wearing it after trying it on and thinking the big size and extra fabric overlap looked too bulky to pull it off even with a tucked, fitted shirt.","October 18, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VVB23","Elise","I wore this skirt to work.","I ordered the equivalent of a US 6. I am usually between a US 6 and 8 and have worn Victoria Beckham dresses that run small in the past. This looks great sitting right at your waist, but it was too big on me and fell in a weird place.

I do not have a large bust so I was shocked by that. If I got it again I would size up, but I think the other parts of the shirt might then be too roomy. If you try it, I still suggest sizing up.

Conversely, the the top part was over sized and I had plenty of room through the bust, shoulders, etc. If you're curvy at all on the bottom size up two sizes. If most of your curves are on top you can probably go with your normal size if you want it tight, but go up a size if you want it to fit like on the model. It's super cute!

It reminded me of a sweater I would have worn as a little girl in the 90s and even a co-worker said the same thing! It is cropped so you'll want to wear high waisted jeans to make sure you don't show mid drift. I think I would have liked it even more if I got a small instead of xs.","October 15, 2019","Other"

The dress just pulls on overhead (no zipper or anything like that) and the material is thick with plenty of stretch. I wish the length was slightly longer, but the shorter gals may appreciate the shorter skirt. I added a skinny black belt, but it can easily be worn without any adornment. The dress also has pockets which is so convenient, and since they are situated right in front, whatever you stow in those pockets (phone, key card, etc.) is camouflaged by the pleats of the dress.

I paired this with a couple of different black tops, because that wound up being my favorite combo. The XS was a perfect fit for me, and sat right at my waist, so it was very figure-flattering.

These jeans have a front rise of approx. 9""...making them ""high-waisted"" for those with a short-waist like me and technically mid-rise for those with a longer torso. The button-fly and frayed hem added a unique touch. I wore them many times before they started to lose some of their shape. I am 5'9"" with a 34"" inseam and usually wear 27/28 Tall in jeans but the 27R fit great.

This is a super comfy fabric and isn't overly tight so there is is plenty of stretch if you are curvy. You will need to wear a racerback bra with it because the back is racerback. It hits a little bit longer on my legs since I'm 5'3 but I love the length. Overall such an amazing looking knit dress I can't wait to rent it again to wear with a little leather jacket and some ankle booties.","February 27, 2018","True to Size"

I rented the Rebecca Taylor Sleeveless Scallop Dress to wear with it (as pictured in the RTR app), but I don't think they looked good together on me, since the jacket covered most of the length of the dress.

I wore it on a date and paired it with a mini white top handle bag and croc cowboy boots because why not. Very London chic, very Paris chic. The length was the perfect mini on a petite body (5'3) which is always a win! One note: the collar when it's all closed up felt kind of tight.","September 20, 2019","Date"

Ultimately, I should have gone with the 2 as I had a lot of room in this dress. It didn't look big or baggy, only in the back could you tell that there was extra fabric/room. This dress is definitely for someone who has a narrow upper torso and smaller chest as the fabric does not stretch or give, it is quite stiff and will hold it's shape, which I personally liked. It was definitely on the shorter side, but I had worn with tights and chunky flat boots so it didn't look short. It is super cute and structured.","December 13, 2019","True to Size"

With the elastic in the wrist, you have the flexibility to wear the sleeve at your wrist or up above your elbow for a 3/4 sleeve style, which is what I opted for.

The dress itself is conservative and the long sleeves make it ideal for cooler evenings/seasons. It tucks in a bit at the waist and is very slimming/makes me appear taller than I really am. PLUS it has a lower thigh/knee-high leg slit on the left side that makes it a younger fit and balances against the grandma-esque floral design.

I’m 5’7 and the dress was a good amount below the knee so it just hit at a weird spot. The side ruching was nice for drawing attention away from the tummy and the belt portion was adjustable.

Kept me warm, but not too warm, after the sun went down. The material is heavy (but not hot), thick, wrinkle resistant, and lays beautifully on the body (forgiving!). I am 5'8"" and the length hit me below the knee and the sleeves were a true long and went to the wrists. There is an adjustable tie around the waist that is easily used even during wear. The neckline is on the higher side, but the shape and small slit on the leg made this dress sexy yet sophisticated. I got compliments all night and felt super comfortable. This dress seems versatile for many occasions. In my opinion it runs true to size, but if you get a backup I would size down as it is a stretch material and very forgiving.

I ended up just wearing a pair of knee length pantyhose instead of underwear because otherwise everything was visible. Fits true to size on the looser side.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RL46","Alex","Such a cute set!!","Rented both this skirt and the matching top to wear as a set, both arrived new with tags, which was nice. I'm generally a medium in that style of sizing so that's what I went with and it fit well. It was a little tight but not an uncomfortable or unflattering amount. Both the skirt and the top have two button holes so you can slightly adjust the size of the waist. The button is primarily what secures the skirt in place, not the wrap tie, but if you needed to adjust bigger or smaller than the button holes, it seems like it could be safety pinned pretty easily. The skirt is super cute for summer, very lightweight and flowy (I wanted to be twirling around in it) and I love the lemon pattern, it's simple but cute. The fabric is slightly shear, so plan to wear nude or white underwear with it to make sure it's not noticeable. I wore it out to breakfast with a friend with some white birks to keep it more casual, but it could definitely be dressed up with heels and some simple accessories, or kept fairly casual. I like that the skirt and top can be worn together as a set but are also cute and complete enough on their own to be worn with other pieces as well. Would definitely consider renting again!!","June 19, 2019","True to Size"

Still, I felt very confident in this even though it's form-fitting. The slight ruching also gave me a little booty so that was a plus. The fabric is a sheer, thin, stretchy print made to look like wool, so it's a fall look that can be worn in 100 degree weather (so Texas fall). Id imagine this is a good dress for all sizes.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FZ44","RTR Customer","So comfortable but unforgiving","The dress is ridiculously light and comfy, but if you are not a small woman (like me) you'll need to pull out the Spanx because it will show every tummy/waist bump and accentuate it. I didn't wear it with Spanx, but wish I had. It made a huge difference when I tried it later. The dress clings very close to the body. The fabric is very stretchy.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FZ44","Sara","This is a quietly interesting and fun dress!","FIT: I was worried this would accentuate my hips and larger rear, and it didn't! It looked so great on, even while it is very form fitting. It hugged my curves in all the right ways. I really loved the fit. You can easily adjust the dress to lay best on your body. There is a slip/underlayer that makes the dress and, as the photo shows, ends just a bit above the outer layer. I wore it with black heels, statement earrings and a bunch of chunky bracelets on one wrist. I let the dress stand alone with its high, tight collar. Pros: Not dressy, but feels more elevated than just dress pants or jeans for a night out. Cons: Could feel, as other reviews mentioned, a little witchy.","November 4, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JCR59","Frances","Nice detail, but the fabric catches dust and lint.","I like this coat, but the wool picks up EVERYTHING. It looked a little dingy already when I got it from RTR. A few people have said the belt falls off, but there are actually very subtle thread loops in waist which you can use to thread the belt. One thing: there is an RTR sticker on one side of the belt. If you flip the belt the wrong way, it's super obvious that you don't own the coat. My friend called me out on it because she thought I left the sales tag on it! It's a very pretty coat and classy, but I wouldn't buy it due to the fabric. It doesn't wear well over time, I don't think, and shows every hair, fleck of dust, fuzzball, etc.","January 27, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KF38","Xiomara","Not crazy about it - runs large so size down!","This is a very thick wool/hairy kind of sweater. Im not a fan because it has a tendency to feel heavy and attracts fuzzies. I only liked the sleeve bottoms. Yeah the back was cropped but it didnt reach the effect level i had desired. I dressed it down and wore it to the grocery store just to get some use out of it but for me it wasnt that great. I would had liked a different fabric perhaps. This would work for colder regions and for casual wear. Im a large and went with medium and that worked out so size down.","January 26, 2018","Everyday"

I wore the size 4 with these pants. I felt like the thicker, stretchy material helped hold in any evidence of my mommy pooch. I saw some reviews that said the pants stretched out and sagged.

The ties are super long, in the picture it looks like it's wrapped twice around the neck but bc of the little ruffle that starts at the neck and goes down the front of the blouse in front of the buttons the toes don't want to stay over top of the ruffle. I could keep that control better with it only wrapped around once and then tied in a bow. But you have to tie a BIG bow in order for the ties to not go halfway down your leg. It runs slightly big.

The length is perfect for me, not too cropped for sometime with a large bust but it doesn't read as a long jacket.

The way the shirt is cut around the bow makes it super incredibly breast focused. Almost so much that I wasn't sure it was work appropriate. It's a white button down! How can it not be work appropriate? They cut the under-boob area in a very weird way. I wore it, but felt a bit awkward in it. No complements or comments on it from anyone at work.","August 8, 2019","True to Size"

They feel soft on the inside, but not exactly fleecy. These were breathable, but still kept me surprisingly warm on early-morning New England dog walks. I really liked these! I think these would be excellent as a bottom layer for skiing, and also could be good for anyone who likes to run outdoors in winter conditions. The teal/green color is really beautiful, and not as aggressively vibrant as, say, over-the-top '90s winter gear. These feel very high quality and are excellent technical winter leggings.

Great length, too, with a generous fit. I'm 5' 5-6"" and the bottom of the sweatshirt hit a tad above mid-thigh. The colors are vivid and bright. I wore it to the office for a chic, comfy casual Friday. I took a cue from RTR and wore the sweatshirt with black yoga leggings, with a bit of shine to them. I wore a white linen button down Polo underneath to dress it up just a bit. I wore a pair of black floral print Dr. Martens with pink satin ribbon laces and the floral print hues totally jived with the variegated colors of the tie dye. I felt unencumbered yet put together all day long. My office is so casual-pretty much showing up in anything but just your underwear is acceptable. (I do marketing & creative work for a nail salon supply company and rarely interface with the public when at the office, so for most of us wearing makeup is even optional.) Saturday evening lounging on the couch I happened to catch a bit of a chill and reached for this awesome sweatshirt once more. It serves as perfect hermit garb as well.

I rented to wear to work as a lot of my work clothes don't fit properly. While this dress was flattering, it was rather low cut so I had to wear a tank top under it. It is also very staticky.

I was a bit worried the cleavage would open up etc but no issues at all. The sleeve effect is great too. Material is beautiful in person, lovely feel.

I still pinned it just to be certain there weren't any wardrobe malfunctions, but I could've done without and been okay which is not always the case.

I've been a 29 lately but was looking into going up a size and and the 30 fit perfectly. This style has a slight raw hem but it's possible to roll them if you decide not to show a raw hem because they will still not look like capris for long-legged bodies. I was so impressed with the inseam length that I purchased them the next day even though it was only at a 10% discount (and probably my most expensive jean purchase ever). I hadn't heard of this designer until afterwards when I did a little research to justify my purchase. Their website reads: ""Midheaven Denim was originally inspired by tall women and has grown to include all women."" And ""constructed of the finest Italian denim. Our fabric is made in the world's most eco-conscious denim mill... you're guaranteed perfection, from the fabric to the fit."" Definitely give these a try!","September 17, 2019","Everyday"

These are not tight from the mid-thigh down, but they aren’t super wide either, and they are quite slim in the hips and waist. I probably could have ordered a 4 for a more relaxed fit, but the 2 also fit me well in a snug way. They are also quite high waisted, and on me they were cropped but basically just to the top of the ankle, not super short. In general, more of a classic cut than a super trendy one. The print is very pretty, and the weight of the linen is such that they can be worn into the spring and fall a bit. I wasn’t sure from the pictures but they do not have any black in them, all of the darker parts are blues. They are prone to wrinkling and the bottom of the legs definitely needed to be steamed before wearing.","September 18, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Sydney","So wearable!","So comfortable and chic. Wore it a few times and was complimented by many. Could be dressed up or down. Loved this rental!","August 9, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Jennifer","Super cute look!","Loved this and wore it with friends for a movie night in the park! Super comfortable and a little sexy at the same time with front ties. A little big in the straps, but not enough to be annoying.","August 5, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Kathryn","Cute, fits well","This fits very well for what I thought wouldn't fit me. I wore it to work with a cami under so the toes didn't reveal to much and then I wore it to a bbq. Lots of compliments. The leg is a little long for me.","August 4, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Mia","My favorite!","This fit so incredible, honestly contemplated keeping. I'm 5'2 and this was not at all too long on me in the legs, the shoulders straps were a bit loose, but they have buttons in the back that allow for adjustment! Also the bust has some give, so the fabric isn't super still and you don't look stuffed in. Seriously contemplated keeping this one.","August 1, 2019","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Kristen","4R perfect on torso, big on top","Absolutely a light weight and easy jumpsuit for everyday! I could have done with a size smaller so it better fitted my top (I'm not very busty). It was fine in the end, but I had to wear a top underneath so the straps and top wouldn't slip as much.","July 12, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Maya","Second Review! FUN JUMPSUIT - RUNS LARGE","I'm usually a 10 and looked terrible in the 10 - got around to ordering the 8 and fell in love. It was still a bit baggy but super cute. Got lots of compliments, wore it to work in the summer. Highly recommend sizing down - even for bustier gals!","July 6, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Sarah","Loved it! Sexy and comfortable","Light material, sexy chest cuts outs but not too much. Only qualm is that the straps are long and you can't adjust and have to pin them.","June 26, 2019","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Tara","Picnic Perfect! (but size down)","Adorably-styled gingham jumpsuit. Lightweight, comfy (pockets!) and flattering. PROS: style, print, tailoring/construction + fabric. CONS: runs large, straps too long and not adjustable (I tucked them in entirely). Would definitely rent again in proper size!","June 24, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Amanda","So fun & flirty, with a hint of edge.","I loved this so much more than I thought I would. I wore it for my SIL's engagement party and got so many compliments. The fabric wasn't too heavy to wear in summer - the back panel is stretchy, so I think this could work for a variety of chest sizes. I did think it ran a little bit - I probably would have worn the size down if I ordered it. Overall, such a fun, standout jumpsuit.","June 23, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Leana","So cute!","Fit so well with 3"" heels. The straps were a little big but never falling down. Very cute and comfortable!","June 18, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Action jaxson","Comfy and Casual","Not the most flattering jumper but super cute. Issues with the mid area - looked like a pooch","June 17, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","RTR Customer","Slimming and stunning","I'm usually a 10 on the bottom and an 8 on the top and the 10R was perfect. Jumpsuits NEVER fit me right and even though it was just slightly looser up top it was so slimming around the waste. I received so many compliments. Tanya Taylor makes exquisite clothes for real women. Will tent again and look forward to trying more of the brand on RTR.","June 13, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","A","So many compliments!","Very comfortable, well-fitting jumper but a little too much cleavage for me so I wore it with a shirt underneath. Wore it on a trip to Southern France and received a lot of compliments during and after the trip. Definitely a unique piece, fun to wear. Probably better for taller women but at 5'4 it fit me okay.","June 4, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Kristina","So many compliments for such a cute outfit!!!","Absolutely loved this. I usually struggle with 1 pieces as I have a longer torso, but this romper fit perfectly. The top did show a bit of my bra but wasn't problematic. Overall, loved this piece! I couldn't believe how comfortable it was for such a chic outfit.","June 3, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Sara","Such a fun jumpsuit","I wore this to my birthday dinner and absolutely loved it. I'm usually a size 2 but only the 0 was available. It was a little tight but still looked great!","May 21, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","RTR Customer","The perfect day time outfit. I rented it to celebrate my birthday.","It fit perfectly and wore it with a strapless bra, but wished the straps could have been a little tighter. I didn't need to size down from the normal size at all! Good with sandals.","May 19, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Jennie","Totally cute!","Everyone I've seen wear this has loved it! I layered it because the straps weren't quite the right length for me.","May 17, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Stacy","A wonderful summer night outfit","Rented this for #datenight. Loved the look and feel! It was a bit large so I felt a little like I was swimming in it. But, I really liked it so I wore a the larger size. It's something i would rent again.","May 7, 2019","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Lauren","Comfy and casual jumper with flare","I usually wear a 10 but ordered a 12. Plenty of room for my c/d boobs. The back panel has stretch so it's great! The straps have two lengths. Absolutely loved wearing this in Cuba! The fabric is light like seer sicker so don't be scared of wearing all summer.","April 26, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Paula","Comfy cute, perfect for touring a city","Slightlyyy loose, but it actually made it very comfortable and perfect for a day of exploration.","April 26, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Carley","Cute and comfortable!","I loved this jumpsuit. At first I thought it might be too bold but I was shocked how comfortable it was and how easily I could dress it down with a jean jacket and white tennis shoes. I loved the pockets. Perfect thing to rent. I didn't realize you can unbutton the straps and cross for a tighter fit until after I wore it, so keep that in mind.","April 25, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Laren","So cute and comfy!!! Danced all night in this!","Typically wear either a 2 or 4, deff size up to your larger size in this!","April 24, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Bri","Cute gingham jumpsuit!","Loved this jumpsuit and wish I had stuck to my normal size (6) instead of sizing up to what was available when I placed my order (size 8). As a 5'2"" lady, this looked better with heels. If I owned the jumpsuit, I would have created more holes for the somewhat adjustable straps to make them shorter than you can make them as designed. Fun to wear! Light fabric that's perfect for spring weather.","April 20, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Mary","So freaking cute, wish i could keep!!","Fit is great, it's so cute, feels expensive.","April 17, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Sarah","Team RTR Review","Love this jumpsuit - it is a perfect weight for vacation and doesn't wrinkle so great for the suitcase. Can be worn casually with sandals or dressed up with statement earrings and heels. Fit was straightforward with room in the bust and hips. If you wanted it more form fitting, I recommend sizing down.","April 15, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Brittney","Fun and girly spring jumpsuit!","Runs large, could have definitely worn a zero. Anyone with a short torso will struggle with this as the straps are long. I also had to use fashion tape on the legs to hem them about 3 inches. Otherwise very cute and fun! Loved it!","April 14, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Ross","No brainer and super cute.","It fit a little big. The straps were insanely long. I wish they would have added a way to make the stars more adjustable.","March 29, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT86","Tara","Amazing adorable jumpsuit.","Loved this jumpsuit. I had several people tell me how cute it was. I wore a shirt underneath cause without the top is pretty low cut. I found the straps to be a bit long which didn't matter cause I wore the collared shirt underneath. I'm generally between a size 2-4 but the 4 was the only size available. I thought it fit well with a little room to spare. The length hit just at tops of my feet. Could've worn flats. Side zipper made it pretty easy to get it on and off.","March 27, 2019","Work"
