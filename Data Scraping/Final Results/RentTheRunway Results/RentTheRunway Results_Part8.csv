The cuts are in all the right places and is perfect for curvier/hourglass shaped girls. The best part is you can wear a simple black bra with it and it will cover just fine. I used some fashion tape just to make sure everything stayed in place.

I'm rather busty so I ran into some issues with the top. I needed to better utilize my boob tape, because by the end of the night I felt much too exposed- thankfully I had a wrap. But otherwise I just adored this dress. It made me feel 10 pounds lighter. It clings in all the right areas, while still covering the problem areas. I will be renting this dress again for sure.

Because stomach rouching I didn't wear spanks, and I wore a normal (non push up) bra. It's a lot of cleavage. I woke a scarf the second half of the night because I felt like my boobs were too out (and I was too tipsy to police them). Bottom of the dress was off the floor in short heels.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP70,Farahin,It's simple yet tasteful and overall a stunning dress!,I think this dress worked well for me since I'm not very tall and I am kind of busty. I didn't have to pin the front to reduce the cleavage or prevent any wardrobe malfunctions from occurring. I found myself lifting up the straps a couple times but the dress did fit really nicely!

I'm normally a size 6 in pants and the size 2 in this dress actually fit me better, but I ended up wearing the 4 for more chest coverage. I ended up pinning it to my bra and even then I was a little worried about the dress all night. This could be resolved by either having a nice bandeau (though it might show under the keyhole back of the dress - I tried), or embracing the cleavage and maybe having some fashion tape handy. A few other things to be aware of - the fabric is pretty heavy, especially because of the full skirt; it's a wrap dress, and while it stayed closed very well it does have something of a slit effect if you're moving around a lot (dancing) or sitting; finally, I'm somewhere between 5'4"" and 5'5"", and I had to wear probably 4"" wedges to not be tripping on the skirt.","December 27, 2019",True to Size

Of course, couldn't help but show off the pocket feature every time I got a compliment on the dress (which was often). It was the perfect color for an outdoor wedding and was really comfortable to wear. A few pro tips I wish I would have known before renting: 1) even though the skirt is a high low, the high is actually very long (for me, 5'6, it was below mid-shin. When looking at previous pictures I expected it to be a little shorter and therefore a little more casual of a look than it actually was. I lightly tripped on the back a couple times even in 4"" heels because it really is floor length. 2) though the dress didn't look particularly wrinkly when I put it on, a lot of wrinkles showed in the photos- I wish I had given it a fresh steam right before my event. 3) the top dips a little lower than I had anticipated so found my bra showing a few times- had I known in advance I would have done a lower cleavage cut strapless or planned for stick ons. Overall gorgeous dress that I would rent again.","July 16, 2019",Wedding

The shoulders have the slightest little puff to them to give the top more structure and the bow at the neck is so delicate. The top itself is sheer lace, but there is an attached black silk undershirt so you can wear regular undergarments without exposing them to the world. I ordered a size 6 to accommodate my chest, but didn't need to. I would size down because the length was a little long and the the overall fit looser than what I wanted. The only reason I gave the top 4 stars is because the metallic threads are super itchy when you first put the top on.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP95,RTR Customer,Gorgeous velvet gown!,"Super comfortable and easy to get on/off -- no zippers or anything... you slide it over or from the feet. The neckline makes the dress -- absolutely stunning. The bodice doesn't have any constructed support, so you could definitely do a strapless bra or even a bra where you tuck the straps down your shoulder if you like that better. Cinches at the waist in the most flattering way and accents all the right places. The fabric feel luxurious -- it's a good quality velvet that feels thick and soft but isn't too thick to make you look heavy or anything. Very comfortable to wear all night long. The length is a bit shorter for a usual R size -- if you like to wear super tall heels then maybe get the L. I'm 5'3 and in photo not wearing heels. Extremely highly recommend this dress.

Pros: The piece is interesting and the embroidery is beautiful. It was the right amount of modesty and sexiness. I felt so good in it. I also liked that the dress was busy enough that I could wear minimal accessories and simple shoes. Definite wow factor. Cons: The XS was definitely short. If I bent over, you could definitely see booty (but I didn't mind). The arms were also tight, so I couldn't lift my arms above my head. The waist seam was also tight, and became uncomfortable the more I ate. Overall though, these didn't phase me enough to distract me from a wonderful night.

It was so tight on the bottom half length wise I couldn't wear it. (I'm 5'7"" for reference) I wore the large and it was a little big on the top half but nothing noticeable.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH261,Teresa,Gorgeous Formal Dress,"I'm 5'7"", small bust (about a full A), approx 135lbs.

I originally ordered a 4L (with 6L as a backup), and the 4L fit me fine, but there was an inch of room on each side of the rib cage (I have fuller hips, smaller rib cage). It's the type of dress that just looks a little better if it's more form fitting. The smaller size wasn't much tighter in the arms or other places, it just really helped cinch in the upper bodice look. Luckily RTR has great customer service, because they were able to overnight me a 2L for a very small fee. It was very cozy for a semi-chilly evening (upper 60s, lower 70s with low humidity). I think it might have been super warm in the sun with a higher temperature, so if you're outside a lot and it's not a cooler season, I'd be wary of that.

The material is a terrific silky medium weight, and it has nice details, like the grommets, and a sweet flat little ruffle above the hemline. It is fully lined. The top of the back is a little puffy, I think because of the darts that give it a nice cut into the waist but it looks fine. It fit very snugly under my rib cage but was not constrictive. Zipping up to the top and unzipping it by yourself is a little work; but to unzip it more easily, just be sure to leave the hook attached at the top so it holds the top material for you while you unzip. I tried on the 2 and it fit so well that I didn't try my back up size 4. It is very low cut, especially if you have a small bust like I do, so I used a white cami underneath. I will try a nude cami the next time I wear it. It feels and looks very feminine, and although it is a little shorter than I normally wear, it was windy outside the day I wore it and it did not fly up to expose me. The cut is terrific for pear-shaped girls like me and I found it very flattering.

I also had to wear heels so it wouldn't drag. For anyone with a fuller bust (I have a pretty flat chest), you may want to size up or it will be too tight in the chest.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/IRO33,Christy,Grandma-ish on my body,"I saw the photos on others and they looked great. I really think you have to be long in the torso and taller for this. I am petite and curvy absolutely not large and the top of this dress has so much of a blouson it looked ridiculous, like my arms were attached to my waist and shapeless to boot. One thing I think I am learning from all of my rentals with unlimited is that torso length matters in some styles, and long legs in others. Petite frames fit certain styles and it's hard to tell until you put the dress on. But when most of the models wearing it are 5'8"" to 5'10"" it puts a damper on a five foot four frame. It is a learning curve But I believe in these reviews we can help each other. Long torso required for this dress. Long legs would probably help as well but the bulk of fabric at the upper part of the dress could only be helped with a longer waisted. My suggestion for this community is that we all detail as much as we can when give a review. I read them and I still make mistakes but I appreciate all the information anyone shares.

Even more confusing is all of the straps Black Halo added for hanging the dress up. They weren't useful for keeping the dress on, but yet they didn't tuck away when you put the dress on, either.","January 12, 2020",True to Size

I was surprised because I do not have a particularly small chest, so I usually don't have that problem. I definitely needed double stick tape, and even then the top doesn't have enough structure, so the points on the bust fall down all night. I also had a problem with the lining shifting. Everytime I stood up, I had to excuse myself to the ladies room to fix the lining because the dress would bunch and twist.

I wore the chest part unclasped so it was more low cut than I'm used to, but I'm glad I did, since it made it look a bit more stylish and formal. The only downside to wearing it low cut is that the chest clasp can't be hidden so it looks like you forgot to clasp it when you're up close. But in pictures, you can't tell. I definitely recommend this amazing jumpsuit for any occasion! I'm normally a size 4 or size small and the size SR was perfect.","April 1, 2019",True to Size

Lots of compliments and the dress really stood out in the sea of other ball gowns that evening. I had carefully studied previous reviews because I wanted to be comfortable throughout a long night with dinner and dancing. There is no restrictive girdle sewn into the dress like other styles (thankfully), so be sure to have a body shaper. I had a backup size in the gorgeous light blue, which was also beautiful. I also tried the longsleeve version, but the weight of the sleeves plus the open back made it hard to keep the front in position. This dress was the perfect choice.

The only reason I made this dress work is that I pinned the straps back (carefully!) If I didn't do this, the straps would have fallen all night. Plus the cut in the Che's was really low, that needed a lift too. I pinned back about 2 inches per strap. Could have done a little more but didn't want to mess around too much.

Here's where it can be do or die for someone with extra booty and thighs...I could NOT raise the dress up to use the ladies room - I had to take the WHOLE dress off. I would keep this in mind if you're going to an event where the bathrooms may be tight or whatever your situation is. I didn't mind cuz I loved the dress that much. I'm usually a 6/8 but had to wear the 10 since it was a bit easier to zip around the booty and sitting down was more comfortable. Also knowing I would need to use the bathroom, I didn't want a horrifying situation where I was struggling to zip it up again and it broke or I just couldn't. I did wear the dress and drive for 2hrs as an FYI so it's not overall so tight where you can't breathe. Given I wore the 10, the top of the dress was loose but it wasn't obvious because of the gorgeous lace and patterns.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VNE9,Karena,The colors in this dress are amazing and actually the biggest compliment I got all night.,"The others are right, the dress it very fitting but at first. Throughout the night it was much easier to move around in the dress-maybe the alcohol helped not too sure LOL but to say the least using the restroom was not a problem at all without any help from someone pulling up or down the dress. If you are ordering I def suggest your true size and backup a size up. I’m a true 16 so not having anything bigger was nerve wracking but it fit perfectly. ALSO for us women who have bigger arms and some extra love in the butt, this dress has enough room in the arms and it hugs all your curves the right way! I started the night with my hair up and took it down halfway through the night. Honestly you can style it anyway, I also had some pretty pink flower earrings that paired nicely and wore nude pencil heels.","July 7, 2019",True to Size

I had rented a different style Vone dress before, size 6, which fit right so was unsure about the 4 in this one but glad I chose the right size. A 6 in this style would not have fit me well or have been flattering.

I would seriously consider purchasing this dress. I paired it with teal shoes and fascinator and got lots of compliments. For a simpler look, a nude sandal would also work because it is a lot of material especially for more petite women. Absolutely loved the way this dress made me feel - pretty and dainty.

The multiple hanging ties add to the feel and look gorgeous. The shape is def 80s, and makes your shoulders look big. However, I spent the entire night adjusting everything: the lining riding up, the waist riding up, the boobs falling out & the sleeves riding up. I am an extreme-ish pear shape and hoped the waist tie would balance out the top looseness; it didn't. The waist tie is very high, empire waist height, so the waist felt very large and baggy. The top works best with fashion tape and a stick on bra. The bottom part was super weird, the lining was stretchy but the top layer was not. For reference, my measurements are 39-31-47 This dress would probably fit better on somebody with smaller hips, and small breasts, and average to skinny arms.","May 1, 2019",True to Size

You won't be disappointed!,"I rented this Halston jump suit to attend this year's Black Girls Rock taping and it was one of my favorite rentals. It was perfect for the occasion. I also rented earrings and a clutch to complete my look. The event was an award show but it wasn't a ball or a gala but definitely had the feel that you needed to be more than just casual to attend. Many of the attendees wore stylish cocktail attire or unique evening attire. The vibrant pink color of this jumpsuit was excellent for summer. The jumpsuit looks more like a gown with the wide pant leg and could be worn to any formal event as an alternative to a dress. It was extremely comfortable as well. I wore the size 6R and it was true to size. At 5'3, I wore closed toed kitten heel that had it sweeping the floor. I never felt like it was too long or that I would trip. But be mindful that if you are concerned about hiding your belly, it doesn't necessarily do that. I do also feel that this jumpsuit would better suit ladies who are a little taller and slimmer because of where the midsection falls but I really couldn't complain. I received many compliments and with the hot summer weather it was tolerable to wear waiting in line outside to go in for the event. This jumpsuit also has an element of class and sophistication that blows some dresses out of the water. Do yourself a favor and rent this right away!

I safety pinned about a half inch from each underarm and shortened the straps with safety pins as well. Fashion tape is also a must for this dress.

The slit is somewhat adjustable with the strings so you can make it more dramatic if you like. The colors are pretty and the design of the dress is pretty- the only drawbacks for me were that the straps weren't adjustable (so I was a little worried about them sliding down all night) and the material up top is thin. If you have a larger chest, it may be too thin for you. It even made me a little nervous on if the clasp would hold.

I'm going to wear it to a bridal luncheon even if I might be a tad too old for it. I do not have much of (well any) butt or hips so the under slip fit me just fine and I wore a M. I was more worried about it fitting me in the shoulders and bust, but it fit my broad shoulders just fine. The dress itself is flowy and hides sooooooo much!!! I'm recovering from cancer and wear a medication pump and this lovely dress hides all my stupid gadgets and gear I have to wear right now. l love that it's fairly sheer bc I get warm easily. I'm going to pair it w black tights and suede boots and some funky earrings and I think it will be perfect for the hostess of a luncheon at Brennan's. I have tried several times to upload a photo but I am doing something wrong bc I just can't get any review pictures to load!

The dress itself seemed a little large and looked somewhat kimono like when I first put it on. I added a tank top (it's a little low cut), belt (the built in belt doesn't do a great job of giving your waist definition) and finally ticked the cuff of the sleeve back inside to give it more of a short sleeve winged look (arms were too long with the cuffs too big and flows, which just added too much volume). But then it looked great! If you are between sizes, size down. That could help too.","August 7, 2019",Work
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SA138,RTR Customer,Will fit a lot of body types.,"I rented size 2. At 34D, the seams at the neckline keep popping out, so I will need a lot of fashion tape to hold them flat. I notice that some of the wearers pictured actually have the seams out to give them more coverage. One can def get away with that but I think that gives it too much of a bathrobe style, bringing down the whole look. Material is very flowy and silky. I find the material a little bit warm for peak summer heat, but it would be great for milder temperatures.","July 24, 2019",True to Size

The opening at the arm with the wrist buttons was odd, because the opening was so large and I didn't love that, but I wore it anyways.
