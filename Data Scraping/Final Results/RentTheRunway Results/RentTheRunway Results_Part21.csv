It has very subtle sequins that are transparent and arranged on the petals of the flowers. Not too many, but just enough to ramp it up a couple of notches. I usually wear either a 6 or 8. The zipper was broken on the 6 so I wore the 8. The 6 probably would have had a little snugger fit, but I don't know for sure if it would have been too small without actually being able to try it on.

There are scattered sequins that give off a subtle gold sparkle. The neckline is pretty without being too revealing. The dress definitely hugs curves - I wore spanx underneath. On my dress, a bit of lace on the right arm had separated and a previous renter had tacked it down with a small safety pin - hopefully RTR will repair this! The lace on the shoulders/arms is a little scratchy, but after a few minutes, I didn't notice. The skirt doesn't have a slit so I had to vault myself into the Dodge Ram truck that was our Uber ride :) I am 9 weeks post-partum and between an 8 and a 10 depending on style. The 8 fit very nicely and the 10 was a little bigger but didn't look horribly baggy - my husband thought the 8 looked better so I went with it. I liked being able to wear a normal bra with it.

I was worried it would be hot or uncomfortable for an Atlanta wedding but it was not at all. I also loved that it is a bit different for a black tie optional affair. I stood out in a good way! I was a bit worried about renting this due to reviews mentioning fit issues, and sadly they were correct. I am a true size 4, 5'7"", and have never had to size up. The 4 fit reasonably well in the hips, but was way too tight in the ribcage. It was like I was trying to bind my chest. So I sized up to the 6, which was annoyingly loose around the hips (not showing off my figure), but fit up top. However once I started dancing in the reception, it felt like the dress was slipping down. It wasn't super comfortable to dance in. I didn't wear a strapless bra so that might have made it more snug. Also, I was somewhat happy that the 6 fit better because the tie fabric detail on the 4 was not sitting right, exposing the white lining underneath, and would have needed to be pressed. Overall, I'm happy I rented this dress and liked the look but wish it was made to fit better and probably wouldn't rent it again.","April 3, 2019",Wedding

I am usually always a size 4 and can even fit a size 2 on some occasions, but it took 2 to 3 people to help zip the size 6 dress up. I found the biggest difference between the size 4 and 6 was in the hip area and not much difference in the waist, which is what I needed.

The different styles you can wear are actually pretty simple to do, there's many videos and Pinterest photos to give you inspiration.. I would suggest picking a style that accentuates your features. I simply twisted the straps, tied it in the back, and created a straight/twisted back line before cinching my waist. It was comfy, flattering, and super sophisticated.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM377,Monie,Almost Perfect Dress,"I rented this for a September black tie wedding in Colombia. When I tried it on, I immediately texted the bride to be sure that ALL THE BOOBS would be ok. She begged me to wear it so I did. At the wedding, I saw I had nothing to worry about. Colombian women dress to kill and I was in great company. Anyway, I am a true dress size 14/38C cup and the dress fit well. I ordered the regular length and the long. At 5'5 with 3.5"" heels, the regular was way too short and the long was perfect. It seemed that the longer length was more well made, somehow. The zipper was heavy duty as opposed to the flimsy one on the regular length. I had much less side boob in the Long and one cup had padding. The other didn't and that's why I couldn't give this dress five stars. The lack of padding had me checking and clutching my boob all night to be sure I didn't expose myself. The padded boob, perfect with no issues. That one rogue unpadded boob, though...WHEW! I wish RTR had made sure both dresses had the padding and I wish they included fashion tape like they used to. People loved my dress and my husband could not stop staring. I felt really pretty and the dress was comfortable (it has only the tiniest bit of stretch -- you will want to get your true size). P.S. In my review photo, I am not wearing my heels. In shoes, the hem of the dress still touched the floor. That is what I wanted.","September 7, 2019",Wedding

Also, the top is cut in such a way that you can't wear a sticky bra (even a plunge one) because it shows on either side no matter what. All that aside, this dress is amazing.

I wore red last year and got so many compliments, I decided to go with red again this year. This wasn't my first choice, it was actually selected by one of the stylists at the Chicago store (they were wonderful!) The dress I originally ordered was too tight and would not have been comfortable for a night of eating, drinking and dancing. This dress was SO comfortable. The material is super stretchy which made it perfect for dancing. With that being said, the material being stretchy also makes it pretty unforgiving in certain areas. Because of that, I didn't give it 5 stars. My underwear was noticeable but I'm not one to not wear one, so I had to just be okay with that. I also didn't like that the dress has long and short straps for hanging (on the inside of the dress) that wouldn't stay in and kept coming out. Nothing major, but again, I did have to make several runs to the bathroom to fix this. I wore an 8L but I normally rent a size 10, I think it runs pretty true to size and the stretch helps as well.

The length was just right for flats or wedges with no dragging in the ground. The front lace panel is quite sheer as well and there is a keyhole in the back. You could wear a low cut backless bra but I found a pretty lace nude bra to be perfectly fine for casual wear. This dress is super comfortable and looks beautiful day or night.

I took it for vacation and forgot my slip, so I wore shorts underneath, but I tried no to separate my legs too much while standing because it shows your legs pretty well underneath the dress. Also, It would look better without a bra or a nubra because the back opens a little. I wore a regular nude bra and it showed the band a little bit in the back. Despite those little details, I enjoyed wearing it. I am about 5'6"" and wore this dress with red flats. It was a bit long, but nothing too bad.

But the loose fit of the rest of the dress is pretty forgiving, while still being flattering. The dress is fairly low cut in the front and opens in the back, so it may be difficult to find a bra that won't show. Not a problem if you're comfortable going without.

The fitted waist adds definition at the waist so that you do not look too boxy in the flowing material. It was very light material and perfect for warm summer weather. It showed a little bit more cleavage than I would've liked, but with a cute bralett underneath, it was perfect. In the back there is an opening, so you can see the bra that you wear.

I could have worn either size (6R or 8R). I wear an 8 in my everyday life, but I needed the 6R b/c my chest isn't so large. The material doesn't wrinkly and the ruffle and ruching hides the bumpy parts and makes it very flattering. CONS: Everyone was telling the truth about the boning sticking. Mine had the boning coming out of the top and I had to trim it a little. It was also coming out the bottom and was stabbing me if I moved in certain ways. Also, I used tape, but I felt like the inner lining in the chest area kept flipping out. I struggled to get it to lay flat. This was all superficial stuff though.

I don't have the best looking upper arms but this split style was flattering to them. The front seams are unique and gave me great curves while having a comfortable fit. Not at all see through. Low cut enough to feel girly on a date but still was work appropriate (I wore it for both). High quality, not baggy or messy looking. Only qualm- the sleeve length was just shy of wrist length, rather than the nice bracelet length in the picture, so it felt like they were just a bit too short and I wanted to pull them down all day.","January 25, 2018",True to Size

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH257,Lori,Great top for work or play,"The fit is nice on me especially since I have a large bust, I normally wear a medium or size 8 to 10. The sleeves are very cute, the fact that it is lined in the front is great since it is white, you cannot see through it, but if you wear it without a bra you will see every detail in your nipples. You would really need to wear a very smoothing shaper under this and something that will not show any hardware to your bra or camisole. I tried it with a camisole underneath and you can see the pattern of the lace. Keep in mind if you wear a jacket over this, you will crush the sleeves and they will be wrinkled. Try wearing it with a cape or poncho instead. I hope my size in details help you, I am frustrated with trying to figure out what clothing fits me. I guess I just have to figure it out with most designers on RTR.","October 17, 2017",Date

I suggest sorting the top of the dress out on a hanger and then carefully slipping into it rather than doing it once it's on. The fit is great, I'm a 34a and didn't need a bra but wore one for shape. The dress is a little tight so if you have bigger boobs, definitely size up. The zipper is difficult but grab a friend and you'll get it on. The slit is sexy and shows leg but is still sophisticated and not too much, and I wore for a work event at a hotel in downtown Chicago.

It was nice that you could adjust the top to three different fittings... though this made the dress a little difficult to get on and made me look pretty flat on top (I'm a 32DD... it helped to wear a bra but then there was just a lot of material up top). The material is well made, but the one I wore had 3/4 of the hem coming out (when the dress arrived, there was a really long thread trailing out from where the hem used to be sewn in), so I had to tape it so the bottom didn't flip out.

Luckily it wasn't super hot out because the material was noticeably heavy. When you moved a certain way, it would create a pouch (that you can sort of see above) and I do think that happens with tunic dresses in general but I think it was more prevalent because of the material. It also came in the mail wrinkled and i had to iron it for a solid 10mins or more and as soon as I put it on it was wrinkled again. I think I noticed the wrinkles more than other people but that was a big downside for me. All that being said however, the dress has beautiful colors - i was worried they would be neon, but they were more like bright pastels. I think it was definitely true to size, sometimes tunics can make you look frumpy but the way it was made, you zip up the side and it instantly gives you a shape. And although the material was heavy, it was not too much material that when I stood to the side it looked to big or wide.","September 4, 2018",Everyday

The color blocking and neck are very flattering and comfortable! The material is a very thick cotton -- for sweaty girls (like me) you may want to avoid this one for hotter months. Cons: Tall girls be warned; this is a short dress and a half inch shy of being a tunic (same length on the M)! Curvy ladies might have some issues with the fit as the material has no stretch and despite the tailoring through the waist, there was not much flare on the bottom.

The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the stiff cotton fabric, which was hard to keep wrinkle-free and was slightly fussy.

It was literally cutting me! I cannot believe they sent this dress. The size 8 was a little snug, but it was a fine fit, especially since the other was useless. I had a baby and didn't want anything too firm fitting, this gave the perfect illusion, especially from straight on for photos. The corset-type part is not thick, so no you won't need, but you may still need stand because it's not tucking anything in. The pattern was fun for this destination Florida wedding. It was flown and allowed ventilation. But in the sun (ceremony was 30 min in 90F direct sun) the poly material did have me sweating. Be careful when you put on or use restroom to make sure both layers are tugged down because the inner layer can be bunched up, leaving you rather naked in the chiffon. I would have liked the top to be a little lower, perhaps on a taller person, it would have looked a tad more sexy. But it looked great! I give the dress I wore 4/5 stars, but complete failure of RTR not to check their inventory. I am 5'1 and wore my tiny2 inch heels because I did not want to bother.

I'm a breastfeeding mom so I liked that the top easily came off to feed and clip back on without having to zip the whole thing off.

Probably felt more tricky for me since I had to unzip to pump during the wedding. Only other negative was I wasn't used to the bell sleeves and knocked some of my silverware off the table.

I am usually a size 6 in dresses but read the reviews and opted to order up for my back-up (size 8). And thank God I did order up! The size 6 would not zip up past the black belt. The black belt has NOOOOOOO give. The size 8 fit perfectly. The dress is somewhat long and might be overwhelming for the petite. The fiancé lit up when he saw me ready and I received sooooo many compliments from random strangers during the evening. The skirt portion has such lovely detailing. This picture doesn't do it justice. There is no need to over accessorize-- I wore black booties (we are still in the dead of winter); minimal jewelry and a bold burgundy matte lip.

Also, it's fairly long so it might be a little overwhelming on a more petite frame. Pictures don't quiet do it justice how it looks in person and loved it even more once I was all styled up for my event. Fit true to size and as other reviews state the black waistband does not stretch, though did loosen slightly over the course of the night. I have wide hips and was slightly concerned the skirt might be too poofy but it wasn't at all. The top was a little looser in spots than I would have liked it to be but mainly I attribute that to having a more narrow rib cage.

The medium fit as well but was just a little too snug for the wiggle room I required for dancing. I received countless compliments on this dress and inquiries about where I bought it! It’s the perfect blend of conservative and sexy. The fabric of the dress was comfortable and I had no problem busting some moves on the dance floor in it! The rental process was super easy!

The length of this jumpsuit was still a little too long, but I fixed that by rolling up the pant legs so that it looked like joggers. (See picture.) The crotch area could look a little weird at times, but I didn't mind. I especially liked the off-the-shoulder top (although I sometimes had to adjust it), the color (it matched my hair!), and the pockets (it could fit my phone well). It made my butt and shoulders look great. I wore this with sandals and flats for fairly casual events (a nice brunch, a picnic in the park where it was perfect for when it got chilly, and a work party).

Everyone wants to look spectacular for their significant other and make these moments special. Not achieved here! RTR should have options asking each person a little more details and have an alert system, warning, that someone else is renting for the same period in the same area (i.e. shipping address or zip code), when renting, to prevent these types of mishaps. I cannot imagine any female having issues taking the time to answer a couple questions of what type of an event, where is the event and the date. This information doesn't need to be public, but give a warning of the possibility of having a twin.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ELT50,Evelyn,Went to a beautiful gala for the Queen Elizabeth II garden in NYC commemorating 9/11.,"Love this dress. The material is very thick which makes it forgiving in the stomach region lol. The part that hangs off the shoulder stayed put, for the most part. I'd have to adjust occasionally but that wasn't a big deal. I'm pretty busty so that probably helped the off-the-shoulder part stay up. The red was slightly darker than the photos which I preferred. The slit is truly on the side - not in the front whatsoever. Overall great dress! Do it!","April 12, 2019",True to Size

It was comfortable, flattering, and I felt amazing in it.","Between the tiny bit of stretch to the fabric, the slit on the side, and the way the neckline hung, this dress was super comfortable. Other than the hanger straps which popped out a couple of times during the night, I never felt like I had to adjust the dress at all. I ended up wearing the MR and felt great in it. Got tons of compliments, but before I left the house, I said to my husband, ""Even if I get zero compliments tonight, I love this dress and I think it looks so good."" :) Nothing beats an outfit that gives you that kind of confidence! Also, I had read other reviews about the ""rust"" color and was really happy with it, especially for an event where at least 100 other women were wearing red.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ELT50,Kathleen,Lovely Color and Unique Style,"I ordered the large and x-large in this style. Both dresses were a bit worn, but the x-large was in pretty poor shape. The seams were out of place, perhaps overstretched, so that the inside lining showed. Also the neckline had lost its structure. Thankfully, the large fit better, though the zipper was a bit tough to navigate with the thicker fabric. Each night before the event, I zipped and unzipped the dress to hopefully ease it for the big day. On the day of the event, the zipper worked beautifully and the dress was a hit! I had many compliments on the shade of this dress- it is a brick red. I was comfortable all night. The thick fabric was snug and supportive but I recommend wearing shape-wear underneath. The length was perfect with my 3-in heels.","January 31, 2019",True to Size
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ELT50,Bri,Stunning.,"I loved everything about this dress. It made me feel so glamorous and beautiful, and sexy because of the open leg and off the shoulder touches. It fit me like a glove, the zipper was easy to get up (unlike the first SR that I had tried on in the same dress and color) and did not drag on the floor with my 3.75in heels. I also really loved the color. It's rust, not red, and it really differentiates you from other people who are wearing red in a way that I enjoyed. I attended an event with a 'This Is Passion' theme, so many people wore red, but I didn't feel lost in the crowd. I would highly recommend renting this for a fancy occasion. That being said, the plastic hangers are extremely obnoxious. I was pulling them in and down the entire dress. I tried everything to hold them down, including two different kinds of clothing tape, but nothing worked. They kept popping out! I honestly considered buying the dress just so I could cut the one off the shoulder off because it really ruined the look to have a plastic string hanging out on the back of my arm. Make sure to have a plan or just honestly, use duct tape? otherwise it will drive you crazy too.","January 24, 2019",True to Size

I had a backup dress at home so there was no harm in giving the outfit a shot. I wore this with long mainly teal earrings and gold pumps. I am bottom heavy and was worried that I should size up in this dress, but it turned out great. It depends on the look you are going for. As a person who wears between a size 6 and a size 8, I personally do not like when there is a gap and loose fabric between the small of my back and my bottom. I want the dress to hug my curves and this dress did that. However, when I was a 0-2 I loved the column type of look with loose fabric at my back. If you are one of those people who enjoys that look and you are between sizes, size up.","November 16, 2018",Large

I was stuck paying out of pocket to return because no one ever responded to me. For this reason I would encourage everyone to use another company despite the fact that the dress was pretty. There has to be a better option.,"September 24, 2019",Formal Affair

For one, it has POCKETS. 2, the heavy material is hot but it’s very comfortable to move around in. 3, I had to wear our sisterhood of the traveling strapless bra to fill out the chest bc it was big around my breasts and ribs. 4, 6L was obviously long so I wore three inch heels and thankfully the gown doesn’t have a slip or extra material underneath, so that made it so much easier to walk around in and won’t snag your stiletto. 5, the color is gorgeous, just look for snags because my gown had a few pulls on the front. 6, it’s low cut in the front and back so make sure your bra is low cut too. 7, the straps tend to slip to the sides but I think it’s just the cut of the gown. 8, Rent this gown. You won’t be disappointed.","September 15, 2019",Large

So, I ended up having to buy a bigger size bra and doubling them up so that I could fill out the top of the dress and not have it falling off. The arm holes were extra wide and my bra showed quite a bit. I had to keep my arms down and to the front all night. I was also constantly pulling up the straps and front to stay covered up. That being said . . . the dress was stunning and I received tons of compliments the entire night. I would say that almost 10% of the adult female attendees complimented me on this dress at some point during the evening. Pictures really don't do it justice. It is gorgeous!

The designer tag fell off the jumper when I took it out the garment bag.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CD35,RTR Customer,Unique and lovely,"This outfit made an impact! I received tons of compliments on it. I had never worn a jumpsuit but thought that renting would be a good way to try. I have a long torso, and I wore a 4 and it JUST fit. The 6 was not available. But, sitting in the car on the way to the party, I thought I was going to choke because the neck pulled very tight, so I had to pull on it the whole way there to give my self some breathing room. The top material is heavy lace, and has no stretch at all. It is also very sheer, with the heavy lace pattern covering the ""necessary"" areas. It does not really have sleeves (even thought the picture makes it look like it does). There are ""flaps"" of the material that cover the upper arm area. I think this design allows for freer arm movement. The material on the bottom ""pant"" part is very thin, and I'd recommend Spanx or similar, unless you have absolutely no body fat at all. The bottom is also high-waisted, which also necessitates some smoothing undergarments. But overall, it was comfortable to wear (while standing up!) and had the right combination of elegance and style for the Christmas party I attended.

The bust was a little tight but I didn't have to wear a bra and the ruffle covered up the majority of that area. The only reason I deducted a star was because it is difficult to walk and get in and out of cars in. The bottom bottoms, while pretty high up on the dress are a little restricting. The hips also had a little extra room which made me look like I had va va voom curves (which I loved in pictures) but when I looked down it kinda looked baggy at my hips- I stand by what one reviewer said when they stated this was made for girls with curves!

The fit is a little strange around the mid-section so if you normally wear a 4-6 go with the Medium. I thought it made me look pregnant. The belt is too short to be useful.

I wore this out to dinner and drinks in Vegas. I loved that it was feminine and classy, yet still my sexy; my husband loved it! If you're curvy in the hips, I would recommend sizing up. I normally wear a size 6, but I'm a bit pear-shaped with curvier hips, and the size 8 in this dress fit my hips perfectly. That meant it was a little loose in the arms/sleeves, but that just made it all the more comfortable. The material is really nice, and the dress feels very well-made. The ruffles are flattering and accentuate your form. The black-and-white stripe trim accent is a nice touch too.","August 28, 2017",Small

One thing to note is that being 5'2"", I planned on wearing 3 1/2-inch heels with this dress. That would have been perfect, except that due to a sprained ankle I had to wear 2-inch heels instead.

I was worried the tan/cream color would be too light for a wedding guest, but it was very pretty. I paired it with some long black tassel earrings and loved the final look! I do think this dress runs a bit small in the stomach, but it fit perfectly around the bust. I normally avoid strapless dresses, but hardly needed to adjust this one throughout the entire night. I would purchase this dress for future events if I could! You should get it :) My only complaint is that the zipper was misaligned/kind of broken on the dress I received, so I pinned the zipper tab to the dress once I got it fixed so that it wouldn't fall down on me while out on the dance floor.","August 23, 2018",Small

The backup dresses didn't fit at all and the long dress felt too formal for the wedding we were going to attend, so I headed to a RTR store near my house. I found this dress and they swapped it out for my backup dresses at no charge, which was awesome. I had to buy a silicone pasty bra, but the top fabric fits more snug than it looks, so it worked well, actually. I wore spanx under and overall felt that it was flattering on my post-(third) baby body and I felt mature yet sexy. I got multiple compliments, but the one downside was that someone else at the wedding has rented the same exact dress! I didn't really care, but I do think that when you select dates for your event you should also select the zip code or city of the event so you know if someone else in your area has rented the same dress for the same timeframe and could therefore possibly end up at the same event as you. Just a suggestion! When you're renting a dress to stand out and not just be wearing any old dress from your closet, there should be some way to know that multiple other people could show up wearing the same dress. That being said, it didn't hinder my experience and I danced all night in this beauty!","May 27, 2019",Wedding

The detachable slip was very tight and form fitting. 2. The dress required two people to get on and off because the fabric is very structured and does not have a lot of give. (It has a side zipper and two zippers from the neck to each shoulder. I needed help getting in on and off over my head.) 3. Because of the delicate appliqué fabric, there was some 'netting' to give the skirt some fullness and structure. Another reviewer had mentioned the appearance of a ""bunchy butt"" and I was able to fix this issue by pressing the dress with an iron so that the netting relaxed and laid a bit flatter.

I am petite so I knew that the dress would be longer on me -- it hit about ankle length -- than on the model pictured so I wore heels to ensure I was wearing the dress instead of the dress wearing me. My only complaint, and the reason I docked the dress one star, is because when it arrived it was very stiff which made the pleats stick out from the sides and from the rear. About 20 minutes with the steamer corrected this issue, but it would have been nice to be able to wear it without all that work.

I was thrilled with the dress and had a wonderful first Rent the Runway experience. I will definitely be a return customer. I would highly recommend this dress!","September 5, 2017",Small
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMR11,RTR Customer,Elegant and romantic,"Being my first time using RTR, I was a little hesitant and nervous about sizing and quality of the dress. I can be so in between sizes so I wasn't sure if I should get a 4 and a 6 or a 6 and an 8; the reviews said it was true to size so I went with the 6 and it fit perfectly! I rented this dress for my cousins August/ barn style yet elegant wedding and it was just PERFECT- I got so many compliments and what I loved most about this dress was that it really accentuated the smaller area of my torso and hid parts that I'm more self conscious about, so it made me look and feel smaller so that was a definite plus!!! The only negatives were the sleeves- I wasn't a fan of the double sleeves so I pinned them together and wore them both up and liked the dress so much better that way; the only issue with that was I had to use double sided tape to keep them up or they would fall down. I also opted to not wear a bra because it's a little low cut so wearing a bra made me look a little more bustier than I liked. Other than those two things- I absolutely loved the dress and so did everyone else!!!!!","August 29, 2017",Wedding

I am 5 months pregnant and haven't felt this amazing in anything in a long time! The fabric has absolutely no stretch, so I would suggest sizing up if you're between sizes. It definitely shows off the cleavage and I really can't see a way that wearing a bra would be possible; so you have to be ok with that:) Also, the long was not nearly as long as I was hoping. I wore an 8L and still wore flats in order for the dress to just skim the floor (I am 5'7). Overall, my favorite rental ever! Would live in this dress if I could!","August 28, 2017",Wedding

It's a beautiful, ethereal dress. Don't let the cutouts scare you! If you are petite and have a short torso like me, the fabric actually kind of folds over each other, and the ruffles cover the cutouts. If you are tall/have a long torso, this may not be for you.

Timeless and romantic <3,"I am 5'3"", 155-160 pounds and have an athletic build (small chest, like 32A-B depending on brand; small but short waist, and muscular legs and booty). I am normally a size 8. For this dress I chose a size 8R, with 10R as a backup. I wore the 8R and was very comfortable! The dress material is thick and stretchy, but do note that it hugs you, so if you like a looser fit I might go one size up. I worried that the low arms would be restrictive, but the material was stretchy so I didn't struggle to eat/lift a glass, hug people, and was even able to dance comfortably. Slit in the leg is sexy but classy; I am short though, so it didn't hit me too high on the thigh. On that note, being 5'3"" I chose the Regular length, but was surprised that it did not reach the floor when wearing 2"" heels. I was okay with this since I knew I'd be dancing, but if you want it totally floor length, I'd choose a Long (L) length. I LOVED this dress! I felt beautiful, classic, and COMFORTABLE!

My arms were a bit restricted, I couldn't lift them up very high, but I only noticed this as a problem if someone went to greet me with a hug or twirl me on the dance floor. The zipper did bulge out at the bottom, right around my butt which was a bit annoying but I don't think it was too noticeable. Not sure if that's a problem for all the dresses or just the one I wore.

You'll need to take care not to flash anyone downstairs as well.","July 24, 2019",Wedding

I'm generally in-between a 4/6 for dresses (34B and 4/6 in pants as well) and this one fit perfectly. It sat a little weird since I have a shorter torso, but nothing that bothered me too much. I did have to pin it a bit to prevent my bra from showing too much and ended up just wearing a bolero to make it easier. Definitely need to wear a strapless (which I didn't plan well enough to have) or adhesive bra. There is a bit of an opening above the black sash that I didn't have a problem with but could be too open for some. At 5'3"" wearing 3"" heels, the dress dragged on the floor a liiiiiittle bit but nothing that made it too difficult if I walked slowly. It flowed so nicely in the wind and I didn't think the slit was too high - it reached about mid-thigh and nothing revealing about it.

The look of the dress was just ""ok"" to me and I almost didn't wear it because I have better prints/looks in my closet. However, the day of the event it was really hot and I was running late and wanted something breezy and easy. This was very easy/light to wear and wrinkle free. This dress was very remarkable to a few of the people at the event, including my partner. He is into high fashion (he's a model) and was WOWED when he saw me. Being an A cup, there was extra fabric up top. It just draped lower and wasn't a big deal. Sitting, the split was very ""sexy momma"". My godson surprised me and walked up to my car while I was sitting down before I exited the car. I felt ""exposed"" because of how much leg naturally hung out. The entire night I had to sit a certain way to keep the dress covering enough of my thigh. I didn't feel inappropriate in it, it just required a level of consciousness I wasn't expecting.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA264,Lilibeth,I felt like a goddess and that doesn't happen -- EVER.,"So, funny story. I forgot that I told my cousin I'd MC his wedding and ordered this dress thinking I'd be sitting down and tipsy all night, not standing for 5 hours in front of 200 people. When they reminded me, I thought to myself, ""screw it, I'll get some fashion tape for roll with it."" I'm *stupidly* glad I got that tape and kept the dress. I have a big tummy in relation to the rest of my body. I'm super self-conscious of it. I usually don't wear fitted dresses because of it but this one I couldn't pass up. Here's why I loved this dress: 1. The stunning cape - The only time I like drama is in my clothing. This didn't disappoint. I felt like a flowy goddess the whole night and totally forgot about my tummy worries. It draws the eye up and away and it was perfect for this event. 2. The color - Pink isn't usually my thing but when I do it I'm all in. She is more vivid in person. She's a happy medium between a pastel and bubble gum and I'm LIVING for her. 3. The material - I wore this on an 80 degree early September day in Washington, DC. It was thick enough where I felt like it kept me together but breathable enough where I wasn't sweating up a storm. 4. The neckline - What can I say? I want to flaunt them while I've got them. TIPS: -Fashion tape is your friend. Not the little strips, the roll. They sell it at Target for $12 I think. -I'm 5'0"" and this bad boy was kind of high. You might consider wearing those cheerleading panties that are meant to be seen. -I had on Spanx. They kept Lolita (what I've named my tummy) in place all night. Get a friend to help you zip. Put her on. Feel like a goddess. Enjoy.","September 20, 2018",True to Size

I would definitely rent this dress again for another occasion if I was sure not to run into anyone who had previously seen it! Only downside worth mentioning - the arm holes are quite tight (guessing due to the structured tailoring of the dress), and I had to pin the top to be sure my bra wouldn't show midway through the reception.

I am a D cup and the top was little big on me but was comfortable. It can be worn with a standard bra. I am 5’9” and the dress was mid-thigh length on me.

I'm a total yellow-lover and when I rented this dress for a wedding, I was keeping my fingers crossed that it would be as beautiful as it seemed in the pictures/reviews. It met and exceeded my expectations! The quality of the dress is very high--from the beautiful stitching & unique embroidery, to the weight of the fabric and length of the dress. Everything was as described, and I was extremely comfortable all day and night. I couldn't count the number of people who complimented the color (or dress in general). It's a rich yellow and it really stands out. I wore this Sept 14, and originally I worried the color would be too summery. But I didn't need to worry, the dress was so gorgeous and fit the festive day. I wore it with 3 inch heels and small freshwater pearl necklace & earrings. I didn't think the dress needed much, due to the great color and embroidery! Definitely would highly recommend!","September 15, 2019",Wedding

The yellow embroidery is very bright, which is fun for summer, but the thickness of the material made it a bit warm for a July wedding. It fit very well and was comfortable but I think it looked a tad long on my short frame. I am 5'2"" and wore 3 inch heels.

It’s longer than I expected. I rented the dress for a beach wedding, so considering how heavy the material felt just on the hanger I knew this wasn’t going to be the dress to wear. Luckily I had the other replacement which also fit like a glove. This dress is beautiful, but I don’t think it’s very flattering on me though. I personally took one look at myself in the mirror and felt like a little girl playing dress up. I would not wear this dress, but I would recommend it as a great spring dress when there’s a breeze and a slight chill in the air.

I think overall it was flattering, although the material is a bit bulky and it kind of hides your shape below the waist. This could be good or bad, I suppose.

Yellow color is lovely, even worked with my pale complexion. Can get away with regular underwear! *CONS: I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 5'6"" as it could get awkwardly long. Warning – fits tight up top, if you're broad-shouldered or large-busted. And there's zero stretch. I ordered the 8 and 10, and the 10 was tight! (Should've gone with the 10 and 12, even though size 12 is usually too big.) I ended up wearing a very thinly-padded bra and a Spanx smoother and got away with it. Barely.

I was able to wear a nude bra with straps, but a strapless would have worked too, because the bust of the dress is very supportive.

Not something i'd usually pick, I was lucky that RTR accidentally sent me a L when I had requested the M because the M was definitely not going to work between the sleeves being too tight and not being able to lift my arms at all. Although the L sleeves were still a tad tight, it wasn't unbearable, as I think i'm just not use to wearing dresses with the style sleeve in general. The black lining underneath kept rolling over which I was unsure was caused by excessive wear or my chest not able to completely fill the L, but it didn't look too worn and I was able to temporarily fix this with Fashion Tape. Since I was sitting most of the time for this dinner date I was still able to work with it by covering alot of the black up with my hair (lol) but overall it was a cute dress that worked for the occasions and my bf still liked it so i'm happy with it. Probably wouldn't rent again (again not my usual style and I try not to rerent to keep things fresh lol) but I would def recommend it to others if that want that subtle sexy look and to stay warm.

I tried to choose a photo where it showed it but wasn't horrible! That is my only complaint, but I got compliments from other women (always more important than men I think!) at the yelp elite Christmas party fundraiser I wore this to. Also the head of our local yelp voted my fiance and I best dressed! The color is beautiful and true to the pictures.

I tried the xsmall on first and it fit like a glove. I didn't even try the small on actually. Pros: it was form fitting but extremely flattering. The material was thick but not bulky and it was the perfect length for me to feel comfortable. I lack curves that are generally needed to fill out body con type dresses but this one seemed to work! (I hope!) it was easy to dress up with a pair of earrings and I felt completely put together. Cons: and these weren't even that big of a deal but the arms were a bit tight toward the top but not bad and it did ride up a bit through the night. However, it did my stretch out on me as a couple of others mentioned. My husband really loved it and he doesn't have much to say when it comes to my outfits so that in itself was great!

FYI, I'm no where near an XS. I did have to keep pulling down the inner skirt throughout the evening, but it wasn't too much of a nuisance for me - this dress is amazing. I'm small up top and with this size I didn't have to worry about any nip slip moments.","August 20, 2018",Large
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TJD4,Tiffany,Stylist Review!,"I love this trendy dress by The Jetset Diaries! Running true to size with some stretch to the fabric, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is formfitting but not too tight. It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra or no bra since it's a halter style. At 5’7”, the regular length worked perfectly. The dress is super flowly and very comfortable, it will work perfectly for any formal event. Pair with nude heels and fun earrings to complete your outfit!","August 17, 2018",True to Size

No bra needed. Definitely pair this dress with a simple black clutch and simple shoes. The texture is a lot heavier in person. Also, the color photographs better than what it looks like in person. It's kind of a dull rose gold thick sweater material. The inside is a dark maroon silk lining. Would not wear this in warm weather.","November 14, 2016",Vacation

In a sea of black tuxedos, the blue definitely stands out! The halter neck makes it hard to wear a bra, but I used adjustable/clear straps and it was hardly noticeable while holding the girls in place. Also paired with shapewear around the middle (this dress will highlight your waist, but also anything else near your waist!) and this looked great. The length was perfect for me at 5'2"" with ~3"" heels. I really didn't want to like this one, but it ended up looking great and I felt like a model in a perfume ad - without feeling to ""sexy"" for work. Also, it's one of the lighter dresses that I can wear for a black-tie event in DC summers, most of them have been much heavier so that was an extra plus.

I wore stickers instead of a bra, and it was fine, but you'll want some support. It was just *barely* long enough with about a 3"" heel, in the long size. Now for the cons: I would have bought this dress from RTR in a NANOSECOND, except for one thing: it twisted all night long. I kept having to yank it back into place. The zipper would get out of alignment, at one point one of my stickers was starting to show, it just kept wandering around me like a cyclone.

I thought it was pretty true to size, if even the teensiest bit big. While I have a wider midsection, I thought it gave me decent curves. The bust was the roomiest, and even though I am a C-cup, I still used double-sided tape to make sure it didn't gap and stayed flat. A normal strapless bra worked well underneath. I'm 5'9"" and wore 3-inch heels and the length was perfect. I could've gotten away with 2-2.5 inch heels too, but anything under that would've made it too long.

I was able to wear a normal bra, but used fashion tape so the bra straps didn't stick out. The dress is not see-through, but it will easily show underwear lines, so Shapeware is recommended to hide it. It is a very pretty soft pink, so great for a light feel for a daytime event.

I was informed the day before delivery that my first choice dress was no longer available and that I could pick a replacement dress free of charge. I picked this dress because it looked fun. The day of the event (wedding) it came down to my 2nd choice and this dress. I went with this dress because it is STRETCHY!!! Pictures don't do it justice! I thought it would be a body-con style dress with SOME leeway, but I was mistaken. Y'all!!!!!! There was so much leeway with this dress! I ended up wearing this one because I knew I would be dancing the night away with my sweetheart, the Best Man. I received so many compliments on this dress, from the flattering style, to the neck line to the fun sleeves. I'm almost 6ft y'all and weigh roughly 175lbs. This dress was a DREAM!!! I never felt constricted at all that night. Best part is, my honey swooned when he saw me all dolled up. Things happen for a reason, even if it is your ""first choice"" dress is no longer available. The picture with the model makes the dress seem like a very VIBRANT fuchsia color, when in fact, it's more of a berry color. I would wear this dress over and over again for that night. My only wish was that I wore spanks with it so my tummy and hips would've ""stayed put"" better, but I was still very pleased with the overall outcome.","December 19, 2018",Wedding

Also there's buttons down the bottom of the dress so you can make the dress open higher or lower on the leg line.

Also hit a bit long like a tunic, but the material and cut is very forgiving.

The color is really so gorgeous it's hard to do it justice in photos but some of the embroidery looks like it's been snagged before so they stick out a tiny but but honestly it's not very noticeable and didn't bother me. I wore this to a cocktail party in Beverly Hills for the Lunar New Year and I felt like it really went with the theme.","February 5, 2019",Large

The 6 was a bit roomy for me in the chest too, but I was able to use fashion tape to close the gaps at the side and underarm. The material has no stretch, so I'd go up a size on your back-up size.

Couple of things to note - the fabric is super lightweight w no liner, which I was surprised about for the cost of the rental, I thought the dress would have more structure to it. Second - be wary of the slightly odd armhole cut - instead of going straight from the neck to the armpit the fabric is cutaway, not hugely flattering. Lastly I have a super short torso, the 8 didn't fit at all because from the waist to the neck was too long. I'm sure it would be fine for normal length torsos.

The top gapped everywhere it could gap. I ended up using some duct tape and chicken cutlets to make it work since I didn't have time to order the right boob accessories. The band around the arm was lower on my arm than it should've been so I couldn't really lift my arms properly. I think it would fit someone who is shorter and bustier than me better.

Loved the fit and the back is beautiful! Got lots of compliments, dressed it down with a leather jacket.","April 29, 2019",True to Size
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Lisa,Pretty little red dress,"Pretty lace with lining cutout in the middle and bodice -still lace covered so not too revealing. The lining on the skirt definitely needs fabric tape to stay down. Very form fitting with not any stretch. If not sure, order up. Really pretty, standout dress.","April 10, 2019",Small
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,Perfect for a fun night out! Got compliments all night,The medium fit like a glove. I dressed it up with a nude heel and matching lipstick. Wearing a nude bra wasn't an issue - safety-pinned it in the back.,"April 10, 2019",Small
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Sarah,Lady in Red,Wore this for a valentine weekend getaway with husband. Fit perfectly and felt amazing. The only downside was I forgot pasties and only brought a strapless bra which I didn't realize wouldn't work so I went braless.,"February 26, 2019",Date
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,"Comfort, class, confidence in this dress","Fit: perfect, true to size, bottom red fabric under the lace was a bit short but no flashing front or back. total movement in arms. Lace was not itchy and didn't snag. Pro Tip: Put earrings and any hair accessories on AFTER the dress, otherwise it will snag. I wore it braless and think that bustier ladies may want to order a size up for chest room.","February 19, 2019",True to Size
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,Super cute and comfortable,I got this dress to wear on a valentines dinner date. True to size and flattering. I'm currently breastfeeding and have 34d and the top was lined enough to make going braless totally comfortable. Would definitely recommend.,"February 17, 2019",Date
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Andrea,"Fun, flirty, not great for limbo",Loved the color of this dress and the cutout on the back. Based on other reviews I used garment tape to secure the slip to the lace and was glad I did as the dress crept up while dancing. Probably best fits someone not curvy from the waist down.,"February 1, 2019",Wedding
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Anna,I wore this dress for a fundraiser event.,"I initially rented a medium, but the fit was too tight. I normally wear a size 6-8. The large was a little loose but fit better than the medium.","January 27, 2019",Other
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,A hit dress at an August wedding!!,"The color is a bit more coral than red, which really stood out. I ordered the S and the XS. The S was too big, but the built in slip in the XS was uncomfortably short. I ended up going with the XS because it gave me more shape. I had to keep pulling it down while dancing, but it ended up working out okay. Overall, I really liked this dress, great for shorter girls!","January 19, 2019",True to Size
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Hannah,Fun and flirty <3,"As a size 8/10, it's always hard to know whether I'll need medium or large. Both fit, but I ended up going with the large for a little extra length :-)","January 18, 2019",Date
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,Classy yet sexy,I actually rented 2 dresses so I ended up wearing the other one but it was such a hard decision!! I only chose the other one because it was long sleeved and it was very cold. Love this dress-- slip underneath is definitely short though so you probably couldn't get low on the dance floor in it.,"January 15, 2019",Wedding
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Brittany,Beautiful color and lace!,"The XS fit much much better, but I opted to wear the S because I felt like it gave me a little more length and I was feeling self conscious about the length for this particular wedding. I felt HOT all night in this dress. It was comfortable to dance in. It breathed well. I would rent this again in a heartbeat.","January 13, 2019",True to Size
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,Beautiful!,"Loved this dress! The color is beautiful and its definitely a statement dress. I paired it with some nude heels and gold hoops. I'm petite - about 5'2"", typically size 0/2 or 26 in pants and the small was a tad big in the waist. Would rent again.","January 8, 2019",Large

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Hayley,Sexy and flattering dress!,"I loved the length and cut of this dress! My chest is a bit large so you could see the bottom of my bra (the panel didn't fully cover it) but I wore a red lace one so you could barely tell. This dress doesn't have stretch, but runs true to size. I felt super cute all night! Best part is that it is actually short, even on a short girl like me.","December 30, 2018",Party
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,Loved this dress!,"This dress fit perfectly as described. However, It was a bit short and had no stretch so i would be careful with the size you order. Received a lot of compliments!","December 18, 2018",Party
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,The party was a disaster but the dress was amazing!,"Fit beautifully! This was my backup dress and I’m so thankful I got it! I’m pretty short so I was worried it would be long and awkward but the underneath was the perfect length and the lace made it classy for my work event. It’s not a body con so it doesn’t feel super tight, which I liked. The cut outs and places where there was just lace were enough to be a little sexy but totally appropriate. Got a ton of compliments!","December 14, 2018",True to Size
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Kate,Fun Christmas Party Dress,"Very fun dress - Perfect for a work holiday party. As other folks have mentioned, it's a bit short but I was standing the entire time so it didn't become an issue. I will say this - I didn't realize how much skin you could see in the midsection until someone took a flash photo! I still think it looks classy, but something to keep in mind :)","December 14, 2018",Party

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Melissa,Love this dress!,"This dress was one of my favorites from RTR! Paired with some bright earrings this was the perfect dress for a wedding in Mexico. I ordered a small and medium and ended up wearing the small. It was a touch tight around my hips, but the medium was too big on my chest and you cannot wear a bra with the dress since it has an open cut out in the back. It photographs great and I received compliments all night!","December 11, 2018",Wedding
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Kaitlyn,This dress is AMAZING!,"If you're even sort of considering renting this dress, do it now! It's stunning. Fits true to size, has awesome detail, especially the back, and the color is awesome. And I don't normally even like red.","December 9, 2018",Wedding
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Lauren,Knockout dress,"Gorgeous red dress- a real head turner. As other reviewers mentioned, the lining is super short, so need to be careful when moving and sitting. It's not my usual style, but I was very happy with it for the wedding.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Erin,Awesome Wedding Dress,I loved everything about this dress. Fit perfectly and wasn’t tight at all around the waistline.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,Great for standing out,"Lots of compliments. Very flattering and attention grabbing. Skirt lining is very short if you are taller, but it's disguised by the lace detail being longer. Didn't want to take it off! I wish I could wear this everyday.","November 18, 2018",Formal Affair
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,Would highly recommend.,"I wish I could have kept this dress. It's so gorgeous, and I got many compliments on it. My only complaint is that the skirt underlay would ride up when I walked which caused a wrinkle across my thighs. I did have to pull it back down throughout the night. Overall, it's super comfortable and fit like a glove. The sheer areas and open back are a great touch as well.","November 14, 2018",True to Size
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Christie,Had so many compliments on the color and lace!

Get this dress!!!!","November 12, 2018",Formal Affair
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,RTR Customer,Fits like a glove and so many compliments!,"I was nervous this was going to be RED RED bc that's not great on me, but it was more of a bold burnt orange/red in my opinion. The lace overlay was thick/high quality, not flimsy - I danced all night without worrying it was going to rip anywhere. It's not padded but with the overlay, was ""bra-free friendly"" if you know what I mean, my favorite part other than the steal of a price! The XS was like a glove, the S was a tad too big. Love it and got so many compliments!","November 11, 2018",True to Size
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF5,Kara,Sexy and short,This dress is awesome. I definitely felt very. sexy. I am 5'5 with a long torso. It was pretty short on me especially when I was sitting. The color is gorgeous. I would say stretch is minimal. No need for a bra which is always a bonus.,"October 22, 2018",True to Size
