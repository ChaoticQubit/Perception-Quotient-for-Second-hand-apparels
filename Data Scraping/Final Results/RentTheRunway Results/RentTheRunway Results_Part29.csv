The fabric is high enough quality to sit and move nicely. My one beef is with the high neck; the very top felt a little constricting, so I only wore it once. If it weren't for that, I might have bought it.","September 18, 2019","Party"

The waistband is SO much better than other silky midi skirts like this because it's a thick elastic, not that weird foldover elastic.

When I put them on they were much tighter than I expected, I would describe them as compression leggings, mid level compression, and I do recommend sizing up. The XL was great for me, but if I had gotten the L I suspect I would have been unable to breathe and uncomfortable. They were cute otherwise with the side detail, but the colors were a bit faded.","March 27, 2020","Small"

Cons- wish they were a little more flattering to the booty and there's some sort of splatter/reflective design on the sides of legs that make them look almost like they are stained.

The pants are built like jeans, fly and button, where the top has smaller buttons - gives it a 'tucked in' effect. The pants are not as long as the picture, but still chic. Comfortable for while I work-from-home over the coming days and chic enough collar for video conferences. Very tempted to keep. #roomforboobs","March 20, 2020","Everyday"

It is low in the front and has a high slit that elevated it from a super conservative wrap dress. The lining in mine hung below the outer fabric but I was wearing tights and boots so you couldn't tell. The texture was unique and overall, this was an ok rental for a work event or somewhere you need to be a bit low key.","October 22, 2019","Date"

The button closure was too far over (wide) yet the top was wide and super low cut. The wrap at the hem doesn't lay properly (you can see from the photo that the left side has a strange angle to it). I ended up keeping my scarf on at dinner with a male friend (too much cleavage), and then kept my coat on the rest of the night because we ended up playing pool.

This wrap is a better than photographed, beautifully dark and dusty blue color. A subtle corduroy pattern and medium to heavy weight dress with lining looked great with leggings and ballet flats. Unfortunately, the dress was missing it inner button to fully secure the wrap. Nevertheless, I felt it tied well enough to wear.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW785","RTR Customer","Lovely dress, awful fit for my body","This dress has such a beautifully heavy, textured fabric and cut that I wanted to love, but the M was unwearable for my 5'4 136lb 36C body. I'm short waisted and curvy-- the button inside the wrap buttoned, but it was close. When I tied the wrap dress, it felt too snug around my hips, yet the top was open an gaping. The arms were also very snug. My arms are average to muscle-y... The M is suited for those with thin arms. Because of the weight of the fabric, there's not a whole lot of ""give"". I'd say this dress is for lean, long-torsoed women. And with the midi length in back, I think it's also a bit more flattering on taller gals. Too bad for me!","October 17, 2019","Small"

Not flattering in the least, but it wasn't designed to be. I got it with tags on and wore it to my office on Halloween (since no one was in the office that day).

At first I considered returning for a size S because it is so oversized but my friends talked me out of it. I ended up loving it as a trendy ""sweatshirt,"" wearing it over leggings on a weekend and on the plane, with black jeans and booties at work. Got lots of compliments and questions as to whether this was a face or a tennis ball (which I think it might be both?). By the end of my rental, the material was definitely pilling, which was surprising for a $250+ sweater.

This dress is so narrow at the hips/butt that even though it fits, it bunches unflatteringly. Also the ruffles at the front don't continue to the back, emphasising the awkward fit of this dress from the back, in particular. It was so unflattering I sent it back immediately.

It’s warm because of how thick it is but is not crazy warm or anything. It’s not itchy but it also has that cardboard-y cotton feel. It’s better than a synthetic but the quality is sturdy as opposed to luxurious. That said, it’s a gorgeous color, the knit pattern is classic but unique, and the elbow patches are a nice touch. The small gave me the roomy, oversized fit I wanted in a sweater like this - I’m sure the xs would have fit fine but I would stick with the small if renting again in the future. If you want it to look like it does on the model in the picture (who I would say is probably wearing a medium) I would suggest sizing up, while if you want a more streamlined look go with your usual size.","November 29, 2019","Vacation"

You might want to size down, especially if you have narrow shoulders - you'll still have that oversized look but it won't be overwhelmingly so. Wore this to work so had to wear a cami under because the V was extremely deep and the neckline was too wide - it kept sliding down my shoulder.

It was just slightly tight in the chest area, but it still fit fine. Would've been better if it were slightly looser though. So stick to your usual Lululemon sizing! I love that it is reversible!

It is remarkably warm and soft for such a thin fabric. Not for the coldest New England days, but would work 75% of the time I think. The short sleeves are an amazing opportunity to show a cool sweater and are perfect with long leather gloves. My one criticism of the coat is that the internal button is a teeny bit too small so the coat slips open inside, but honestly it isn't a big deal because the way the coat is structured other buttons hold it closed. Not a deal breaker. One regret is that while the incredible design does allow it to be reversible, obviously one can't remove the internal tag on an RTR piece as one would on one's own clothes so I'm not sure it can really be worn reversed under these circumstances. Unless you really didn't mind the tag. Try this you will die for it.","February 1, 2020","Everyday"

I don't think there was enough room for the front lapels to overlap. That meant the jacket didn't lie smoothly when tied at the front. I tried to tie the ties at the back but that was really uncomfortable to sit back against. Wouldn't rent again. Perhaps better for a straight or apple body?","May 29, 2019","Work"

When I got the size 52, it fit better in the waist but was still pretty loose on top for me. The sleeves are long and the shoulders are a little wide. It would be nice if it didn't have to be tied closed all the time, but that's pretty much the only way it worked for me to wear it because of how the belt loops are positioned.

They fit at my natural waist perfectly (27"" most of the time) and were pretty flattering on my bum. The ONLY thing I wish was different is the length - I'm tall so these were a bit too short on me. The cuffs came up to my calves so the split on the cuff looked a little weird, they didn't look as tailored and fitted on the bottom as I'd like. You can see it in the pic.

I wore them twice: once casually with a sweatshirt and sneakers and once a little dressed up for a meeting with booties and a blouse. I have to say they looked better worn casually.

The sweater also arrived on a hanger so there were misshapen bulges in the shoulders. I do try to wear it and the metallic fibers were so Scratchy I took it off immediately and didn't try wearing it again. It was cute but definitely not functional.","October 21, 2019","Everyday"

The material is thick and warm, and I loved the long length, but I wish I'd ordered a size down because the oversized nature of the coat allowed for drafts to sneak in on windy days. I also love the look of the ""blazer"" neckline, but on really cold days, I wish I had a coat that covered more of my my neck...so plan to wear a scarf with this one if you're wearing it in colder climates.

Cons: it's a nearly floor length knit skirt so it is a little heavy but the thick waistband does most of the work, and I was very comfortable wearing it in mid-70 degree weather.

The dress was okay- it was nice. The length was gorgeous, and the fit very slimming- I loved how a little leg showed when I walked. But the belt thing in the back was awkward... I tried it on the front, but would have been twisted or backward, so I put a thin belt slung loosely over my natural waste to add a little style. Also the top was kind of weird- no real structure to the collar (which would have taken this dress to a next level couture look), too much room in the chest, and I kind of felt like I was missing a name patch sewn on over my heart. Still, I got plenty of compliments, and was definitely comfortable all day. Bottom line? The dress was fine... It's just missing an it factor.","July 27, 2019","Work"

This dress is somehow sexy and extremely covered up simultaneously. I normally wear a size 6 but I first tried the 8 because others had indicated it runs small. The 8 was very unflattering and particularly tight in the hips and belly. I liked it so much that I tried again with the 10 and it was perfect!

It arrived NWT and wasn't quite as tight as other items I've ordered from this designer (possibly because it was so new). I'm a 2 or a 4 depending on the brand, and I usually order a IT 40 (US 4) in this designer. I opted for a strapless bra because of the neckline.

The shape is very flattering, and I liked the stretchy fabric. It was thick enough to be flattering, but thin enough to be comfortable. The tweed-y pattern is cute and great for the office. The boat neckline is also flattering, but does require either a strapless bra or adjusting the straps on a regular bra (which I didn't mind and is pretty much always the case with this type of neckline). I would definitely recommend this. I think it's an especially nice transitional-weather piece because it does feel breathable while still providing coverage.","January 8, 2020","True to Size"

I generally size up from my dress size of 4 to a 6 in pants. These fit true to size, which means on an hour glass figure like mine these were great in the legs and hips but loose on my waist.

I rented the navy version of this back in December to complete a few navy/white/black outfits. I had sized up one to accommodate sweaters - which made sense at the time, because the sleeves are initially quite tight along the shoulders and upper arms. despite a very loose fit in the torso. In renting the new black iteration for this season, I had both the XL and L shipped to me just in case the sizing was a little too tight in the shoulders/arms again. After trying both on, I was swimming in the XL vs. the perfect silhouette of the L.

Big fan of this brand.","This dress was a real win - after another recent rental, I'm a big fan of Shoshanna. I'm often in between a 4 and a 6 but 6 had the right amount of room for me in the waist, where I'm usually a 27/28 in Levi's jeans. I'm also straight bodied and relatively small chested. I wore this for my sisters baby shower and got a ton of compliments. It fits the body well and the sash adds something different. Great for a daytime event, and probably an evening one too!","November 19, 2019","Other"

The photo here is the size 2.

I also loved the fabric- thick enough to hide bumps but unlined so it could be worn in warmer months. The ruffle lays nicely and adds interest. The shoulders were a little tight for me, but that is not abnormal for other items I wear. It's not particularly stretchy, so if you're between sizes I would suggest going up. I'm a true 16, with a 35"" waist and it fit great. I'm planning to wear it for a conference and job interviews I have this month.","March 3, 2020","True to Size"

It's also quite long — it hits me just below the knees in that unflattering area where legs look fat rather than just at the base of the kneecap, which is very flattering.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BBC90","Donna","Waayyy too big!","I was really hoping this would work as a everyday look but the top is enormous and the bottom fits but is on the short side. There was just no way to make it work. The problem that I see is the garment has no zipper, so the neckline and arm holes are very large. You get into the jumpsuit through the neck hole. That causes the bodice to be out of proportion to the bottom. I tried to style it with a shirt underneath but just didn't think it worked. Tall ladies, the pants will be cropped on you!","November 4, 2019","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JCR4","Em","Cute pop of pink but not a true winter coat!","The pop of pink under the collar was adorable ! This coat is very lightly lined and is more of a long blazer than a true pea coat. I think anyone would be cold in it if it's less than 50°F. The white checks looked a little dirty and off colored for some reason. The fit was structured ...definitely more on the oversized large side though. I'm 5'8"" and it was a nice length hitting mid thigh. It buttoned shut easily with the two buttons even though my hips are wider than my top half. My biggest complain with this coat is how wide the lapels lay on the chest , you would really need to layer up with sweaters and scarves for this to be a practical coat, but the shoulders and arms are a bit too tight for that. Try it if you have unlimited but otherwise I'd recommend skipping this piece. Feel free to follow my RTR adventures on insta @conceptualemily","February 4, 2019","Everyday"

I cannot get enough of this shirt. I love it. Rent it. It's classy, dressy, sexy, chic and modest all at the same time. You will not be sorry. My debit card's about to be sorry though.

I loved the comfy roominess/airiness of it but see how other reviewers said it was boxy - though personally I thought it was more of a style that wound up being really cute on, especially with slim fit pants.

Watch the slit while sitting, though; I wouldn't recommend wearing this in a professional setting unless your legs are covered! I wore this to a conference and ended up draping my tablecloth over my leg as the slit opening rose past my upper thigh and I didn't want to embarrass my table partners.

It is really cozy and comfortable - the material is warm and not scratchy, and the knit is pretty heavy. I rented an XS (I usually rent XS, or S for an oversized look) and could easily wear a long sleeve shirt underneath if needed. I paired this with jeans or leggings. The sweater hit me at around the hips, so I tucked it into my jeans. The sleeve length was perfect on me - so may run a little long on others as I have longer arms. It fit well in the shoulders, and I thought the pattern made it flexible to look fitted or oversized, depending on the person.","January 16, 2019","True to Size"

Its the best fitting sweater that I've worn in my life (I'm short and I have a short torso and I've got a bust that is too big for a lot of fashionable sweaters that aren't a loose fit); it's comfortable, and it's stylish. If I was able to afford this (it's marni, so of course I dont have that ability), I'd buy it in a heartbeat.","October 10, 2019","Work"
