It turned out to be thee PERFECT number for my bridal shower. I had to go with the smaller of the sizes because it runs big. It is a heavier material but once on you can't really tell. The length was perfect for me and I'm 5'3. It is hard to zip up by yourself so have someone handy. I also took it to the cleaners to get it hard pressed for my event.

It's deceiving looking online as it looks like a shapeless white dress w ruffles. It's actually a gorgeous statement dress that made me happy all day. As other reviewers shared, be mindful of the wind--I wore a red lip and several times had to catch a ruffle from blowing into my lipstick! I will say I had to iron it and afterwards it didn't look like I had but it didn't take away from the appearance. It's very short but made me look Meggie than I am. Constant compliments (husband said he didn't ""understand"" it & that I looked like a cupcake! I wore it nevertheless and when he saw me later in the day, he said it was incredibly attractive on!).

The ruffles in the front were frayed. I am 5'2"" and the dress was short! It was perfect for me but I can't imagine someone with long legs. I got a lot of compliments so that is why I gave it four stars but I was disappointed on how worn it looked and how hard it was to get the wrinkles out.","August 1, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MSGM61","Lisa e","Perfect for my birthday party!","This is a super beautiful and fun dress - chic, whimsical, and dressy. Fabric is not exactly what I’d expected from the pictures: the main body of the dress is a thicker, almost canvas-like material, while the ruffles are similar but feel a bit lighter. A nice detail is that the ruffles are raw-edged, with a hem stitch inside of the raw edge to keep it from fraying - adds a nice extra bit of texture and elevates the look. Will arrive a bit wrinkled and flat, which looks ok, but the shape is really special if you take the time to re-steam it before wearing (my pic is right out of the bag, not steamed). Also has pockets - although only one is really usable since the other is underneath one of the larger ruffles. Fit: not fitted overall so you can go up or down a size without it making much difference. It is quite short, although for me because of the overall modest/covered nature of the shape it balanced out fine. A few quibbles: the arm openings are a little tighter than I’d preter - a lower cut would be more comfortable. Also, the zipper is super short, so you have to put the dress on over your head - it would be so nice, especially with a white dress, if you could step into it rather than dragging it over a face of makeup.","July 30, 2018","True to Size"

One (the 44) was the right fit, but the bottom had been cut off...like literally the hem wasn't there. I don't know what happened to it before me, but it was all jacked up and was way too short (I'm only 5'2 and my butt cheeks were hanging out while I was standing straight up). I had to wear the 46, which was too big, but still looked good!","July 26, 2018","Large"

From the side view it does look like a bit of a tent due to the silhouette and the ruffles so I may not wear this for the beach portraits on vacation as I intended. Very easy to wear, not at all as short as I expected (I'm 5'7"" and would wear this comfortably without fear of bending over!). Material is thick so it's more structured than I thought which will be good for windy days, but may be a bit hot in really warm weather.

Very Carrie Bradshaw in the opening scene of SATC the movie. It's very A line so when you're taking photos don't do it straight on so you don't look like a triangle. The ruffles on top are the perfect bit of ""extra"" so don't also overdo it with accessories and loud shoes. The dress speaks for itself.

I'm usually a 6, which as too big on me. If you are between sizes go with the smaller size. I did use fashion tape to minimize side boob exposure, plus the sides of the cups didn't lay perfectly flat, which I think because I have a large cup size.

I ended up fighting with the straps of the dress most of the night as they kept falling off my shoulders. I only wore it for 3 to 4 hours so it wasn’t too bad.

It was so comfortable and fit well. I got SO many compliments on this dress! It looked great for a fall wedding and the material was thicker than it looks, so it kept me from feeling cold while outside at the reception. My only complaint was that, since I wore the bigger size, the straps across my shoulders were loose. But it wasn't anything that a little fashion tape didn't fix. I also loved that since the neckline of the dress was so high, I didn't feel like I had to wear a necklace! I just wore some dangly earrings and didn't bother. As someone who HATES dress shopping/dressing up, I loved that this dress was fancy and fun, but didn't require me to do much additional work to look ""put together.""","November 5, 2018","Wedding"

It was sexy without being very revealing. Tasteful cleavage I call it. In every day clothes I'm a 14 but I always go up to a 16 in formal wear b/c I have fairly broad shoulders + a fairly large chest and this was spot on for me. The neckline and sleeves have a silicone on the inside to help keep them in place. I didn't have to fidget with the dress at all. It stayed perfectly in place. It's a show stopper for sure.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM403","Amber","Julia Roberts' Pretty Woman moment in this dress! Felt like a million bucks. It's so flattering.","I joined RTR for this occasion and had my eye on this dress, but in royal blue. The blue option was pretty much always unavailable through my unlimited membership (so frustrating), so I tried several other dresses. I found a few really great options, but none of them seemed like ""the one."" I finally decided to try this dress, unsure if red was appropriate for a summer evening (black tie) wedding, or if I even wanted to stand out that much in a sea of LBDs. The moment I put it on I knew it was the one! I'm pretty curvy, busty and still carrying some extra baby weight (2 years later). This dress did wonders for my figure. It was flattering without shapewear, but even more so with. It made my mom bod look like my pre-mom bod. The neck line (on my small shoulders) was so flattering. I received SO many compliments throughout the night and they continue rolling in on my photos. I was able to eat, drink, dance and feel totally comfortable all the while. The length, in 3.5 inch wedges, was almost perfect on my 5'4 frame. The front of the dress did graze the ground and I did have to lift it sometimes to avoid tripping. I'm happy to say that apparently red is very appropriate year round. There were a few other women at this very formal wedding also looking fab in red, but I still loved my dress the best. My only real issue was one that had been mentioned in other reviews of this dress and the royal blue option - there is sharp plastic boning that has managed to puncture the dress in some spots and if/when it works its way out while you're wearing it, it will STAB you in the torso or back! Fortunately, this happened while I was trying it, so I was able to work it back in before the event. Otherwise, it would have been a real pain - literally! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRESS, especially to those who've ever wondered what it's like to feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.

Definitely hugs your curves and smoothes them out. It's made of a heavy, stretchy material that really helps suck you in, and also has boning around the rib cage, so it provides some structure. I wore the 8L, and I'm 5'8. Perfect length with a 3 inch heel even. I am a 34DD, and I did not wear a bra, probably couldn't have fit one even if I wanted to! But the dress had plenty of support, so it wasn't even an issue. I would normally have rented the 10L, but it wasn't available. The 8L worked out better than I could have imagined.

The leather is supple and almost has a stretch to it, the waist band is wide and comfortable, making the cut incredibly flattering. The length is perfect for mid thigh (5'7""). Only concern was the deep V neckline, I wore a black plunge bra that peeked out here and there accidentally but wasn't too much of an issue.

There are shoulder pads, but I thought they worked with the dress to add some structure to the shoulders. It's not a showstopper or a wow dress, but I loved it. It was a little tight getting it over my head to put it on, so I'd recommend doing hair, eyelashes, heavy makeup after the dress is on. Also, it's not the easiest dress to get out of. It's not hard to get out of, but if part of your plan for the night involves sexily slipping out of this dress, that will be a challenging task. It runs big in the chest, but I was able to adjust it with a couple safety pins to connect the bottom layer to my bra to keep it in place.","April 15, 2019","True to Size"

However, a fatal flaw is that there is way too much room on the upper level. Even if my bust was large enough to sufficiently fill out the top, I don't think I'd be able to get it on in the first place (because then it would be too difficult to slip on through the waist). Unless I'm missing something beyond the partial side zipper, the ratio that would suit this dress wouldn't be able to get it on in the first place.","June 1, 2019","True to Size"

I also was surprised with the cutout in the chest area, maybe I did not look at that photo carefully enough, or maybe it was just more open because I am a DD (added a photo to clarify) but that was worth noting as well.

Overall a wonderful first RTR experience and I will definitely be getting more!","January 23, 2019","Wedding"

Fabric is super comfy and thick enough that it's forgiving. Pop over top was super flattering since I by no means have a flat stomach. Loved the dress but the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the top part kept rolling over to reveal that rubber grip that typically holds it in place. Not visible in pictures but annoying to look down and see all night. I didn't have dbl sided tape so I'm not sure if that's a solve and again, I'm large chested so it may just be my body type causing this.","November 13, 2018","True to Size"

The blues were just like they look in the photos. PROS: pockets!!, the one sleeve was fun and sexy and flattering to my chest, the asymmetrical frame gives the chance to show off whatever fabulous shoes you're wearing, and the fabric is a little heavier so I was comfortable temperature-wise. CONS: the 6R was slightly tight in the ribs for me, but the 8R was too baggy and made me look like a box. I wore the 6 because my husband said it made my figure look sexier :P. other con was that the back was slightly too long for my height, meaning that I had to lift the dress in my hand when dancing so I didn't step back on it and fall on my @$$, even with 4"" heels.","February 20, 2020","True to Size"

I loved it. I didn't wear a bra under it as I am not super big in the chest area. I did wear heels for the ceremony but those came off at the reception. The only issue without heels was walking up and downstairs but that didn't happen much. The only bad part about this dress was the zipper and clasp. It was hard to even get it unzipped when the dress was on the hanger and my husband had a hard time when he was zipping me up. I got compliments all night long on the dress and everyone asked how was my experience with RTR, and I said so far so good. It was so easy. I would have liked to get the dress a couple more days before I needed it as this was my back-up dress as the originals did not fit.

I actually wasn't able to wear a bra with it, it wouldn't have zipped, however this actually wasnt an issue. I NEVER don't wear a bra being 34F and i felt totally secure in this dress. there are thin pads within the front lining of the dress and some boning on the side so it actually was amazing without the bra. if you're large chested or have a larger rib cage, or definitely want to make sure you can wear a bra, i would recommend sizing up, or getting the larger size as your 2nd option.

I tried the 12, but that was definitely too big! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review was because both dresses had defects. The seams on both sides of the frilly part of the bottom of the 10 were loose. Since that part wasn't tight, it wasn't noticable during wear, which was good!

If it was mine I would gave gotten it hemmed towards the bottom to make it a little tighter but it was perfect for this event. Would totally recommend!!!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL100","Jocelyn","I received so many compliments on this dress and felt like walking PR for RTR. Highly recommend!","Both sizes I ordered (4 and 6) were a bit too big in the bust area, but not so big that I couldn't make either work. The 4 fit better up top, but the torso/leg area was a bit too tight, and I wanted to have some sort of room to move for comfort and dancing, so I wore the 6. My husband did have to be on watch for the back falling too low, but that didn't happen often. Overall, I felt really great in this dress and loved that I was able to wear something I wouldn't typically choose to buy for myself. The fabric is thick, and it was 90 degrees and very sunny, so needless to say, I was a wee bit hot and sweaty, but the sweat didn't show through the fabric, however it did wrinkle a bit, as you can tell in one of the photos. The dress, with the addition of shapewear, was a bit difficult to get in and out of when going to the bathroom (it was a small stall).","August 6, 2019","True to Size"

Each dress I rent is better than the last, and this was my favorite rental by far!! The color really stands out! The 6 was a little snug in my hips, and I knew I wanted to dance, so I went with the 8. I didn’t have any issues with the zipper, as some reviews said. I had to wear a strapless bra, because my girls need the support, but that is just my body. The fabric is thick and has a little stretch, but not too much. I decided to wear it with the 1 shoulder, which I thought was a little more flattering. You will NOT be disappointed with this beauty! I can’t wait for my next fancy event so I can rent another beautiful dress!!! 💛💛","August 5, 2019","True to Size"

My pooch was unreal and we were drinking beer at the wedding, too. Was still a gorgeous dress, though. It fit very well and I wasn't hiking it up all night long. I loved this dress; just wish I wasn't so self-conscious about my pooch.","August 2, 2019","True to Size"

I have a broader rib cage and the 8 just couldn't quite get up there. 10 fit well - with a shaper underneath. This dress doesn't hide anything. Great color and length, and was a bit easier to move in after wearing it for about an hour or two before my event.","August 2, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL100","RTR Customer","Comfortable material hugs your curves","I liked this dress because it was form fitting but the material is thick enough to where you probably don't need to wear Spanx or a bra though I did wear Spanx. Didn't have problems with it slipping down but the hook on the side did dig into my side and left a mark, that was the only downside! It is fairly restricting so if you plan on dancing at a wedding and really cutting a rug you may want to get something else. Also FYI, I also expected it to be a bright yellow but it was more of a mustard-though I like that color too!","July 23, 2019","True to Size"

I am very petite, but do have some curves so I felt this dress was super flattering for me. Only downfall was the elastic on top did continuously flip over throughout the night, but it wasn't very noticeable since the inside of the dress was all yellow. Even when it flipped, the dress still stayed up and in place.","July 8, 2019","True to Size"

I wanted a dress that would feel fancy and a bit sexy for a city wedding. The fabric is thick and resists wrinkles, the color was beautiful and the cut was flattering. It hugs ALL the curves so I suggest spanx for sure. My only complaint was that the top of the dress, where there is a rubberized edge to keep it from slipping, it kept flipping down. Not a huge deal but I had to adjust throughout the night.","July 2, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL100","Sariya","I got compliments on this dress all night long!","I was afraid this was going to look frumpy on me because I’m so petite (5'1''/105lbs) - but I LOVED IT! The material was thick enough to add structure and an hourglass shape (that I don’t naturally have) but light enough that I was able to comfortably wear it to a summer wedding. The only con is that if you decide to wear it one-shoulder as I did, you may find yourself adjusting the strap from falling down. It’s also hard to lift your arm up very high because the fabric does not stretch that way. So if you’re planning on dancing all night long, maybe wear this as a strapless dress. Same with the bottom - it doesn't stretch so if you're short like me, you may have trouble getting into a car.","July 1, 2019","Large"

The colors are so different from any other dress and the deep v chest is really flattering. As for fit, I'm 5'10- the R was the only one available but I do wish I could have gotten the Long- it hovered about an inch above the ground w/o heels.

The lace overlay was gorgeous, and the pastel colors were so much fun for an outdoor spring wedding! The neckline is unique and so flattering. Like other reviewers mentioned, the waistband has no give; however, there was plenty of room in the hips. Having a more athletic build, I had difficulty filling it out. I would have rented a smaller size if it had been available. The length was perfect with 4 inch heels, so I would say it's on the longer side. I got millions of compliments on this dress!

It was a touch too big in the hips for me when standing but made it comfortable to sit in. Can't wear a traditional bra but the sticky ones worked because the material is thick.

I had a last minute freak out because they didn't end up having my usual size in time for the event. I'm pear shaped, normally a size 6 bottom and size 4 in dresses. I had them send the size 2 along knowing that most likely I would have to wear the equally beautiful but not quite as stand-out back up dress. It was a miracle that the 2 fit me and I felt like a star all night long. My only gripe being it's easy to trip over/ get your heel stuck in the intricate lace bottom, so maybe wear a wedge heel.","April 28, 2019","Wedding"

The length was ideal with a 3 inch heel (I had ditched my uncomfortable shoes by the time we got around to taking a picture). As other reviews suggest, there is a tendency for the heel to get stuck in the lace. There is plenty of breathing room and the dress can easily be dressed up or down. The quality of the lace is impeccable. 10-10! Heads up; despite the oranges, colors are certainly more spring than fall.","October 22, 2018","Wedding"

I have a very small waist as well. I went with the 0R because the 2R would have been too large on the bottom and the neck as where as everywhere else.

Cons: the layers of lining got a twisted as the night went on, but on the plus side the most outer lining layer stayed put so nothing showed. Fit: I am smaller on top and curvier on bottom, so the 10 fit great on bottom and I easily safety pinned the halter closure to take it in a bit.

I wore a regular strapless bra and everything stayed tucked in well. The ribbon at the waist is not forgiving and may bother some. Also, a stiletto heel can occasionally catch the lacework, so perhaps a delicate sandal with bit wider heel would make for the best shoe.

The 8 fit me well and wasn't too tight, however, it was on the shorter side length wise. Only downside was that my fiancé got caught on my dress a few times on the dance floor so be aware that the lacy material gets caught easily on buttons and shoes.","June 17, 2017","Wedding"

I felt like I should have worn shapewear to keep my midsection in check since it hugged all the curves.

My dress arrived a little wrinkly through the mid section from shipping, but the lighting at the event was dark, so you couldn't really see it. I'm sure a light steam would easily have fixed it. What I loved most about this dress is the length - it elongated my body and hit just below the knee (I'm 5'5). I wore a 6 and found the fit true to size. My backup was a size smaller, and while it was more fitted in the waist, it was a little tight around the hips.","March 1, 2019","True to Size"

The dress is really lovely, though I found the loops at the neckline to be a little ""frumpy."" Overall the cut was nice. Length was longer then I expected. It looks like it hits the model in the image at her knees, but the lace definitely hits below the knee (more midi-length then knee-length). I'm not a tall person, so midi lengths tend to make me look even shorter. My biggest issue comes from sizing. I have not quite figured out the sizing aspect of RtR yet. This was my 3rd rental and it was the 3rd time I couldn't wear the dresses I selected due to size issues. Each time the dresses have been MUCH smaller than I expected (even though I practically memorized and agonized over the size charts on each dress I selected). This time I opted to go 1 and 2 sizes up from what I normally wear and we got much closer with the sizing. However, the 8 was just a bit too snug and I was swimming in the 10.

The 10 fit great though I could have filled out the top better in an 8. 4/5 stars only because the slit in the front is a little sensitive so you have to be very careful (i.e. getting into cars and sitting) so I wouldn't recommend if you're going to need a lot of movement in a dress.

My only gripe was that it was a bit baggy in the bust and shoulders (even though I wore the smaller size) and that the fabric is a bit stifling (really traps heat) since it’s polyester.

Edged it up for Easter.","When I ordered this it was supposed to be 84 and sunny on Easter Sunday but by the time it got to me the forecast changed to 60s and overcast. Alas, such is the law of the land when working with RTR and SoCal weather. I was able to edge this up a bit with black boots and a black vegan leather jacket and I thoroughly dug the look! The jacket kept me warm enough luckily, as this dress is basically holes so you will feel the air come through for sure. I think it was made for someone taller than me--I have a long torso but the bust felt like it was long on me, if that makes sense. I ended up wearing a white bra under it that showed a bit for my own comfort (meeting family on Easter was not the time to show side boob or catch a nip-slip) but under different circumstances and with excellent posture at all times I could've gotten away with it sans bra. The waist is not stretchy so if you are bigger than a 25,26"" waist I would say go bigger than the XS. That said, it felt sort of big in the chest compared to the tightness of the waist, but I only noticed it when sitting down. Gorgeous dress though, definitely recommend!","April 25, 2019","Party"

I used a pull-up/push up sticky bra that's been advertised all over Facebook, and the bust of this dress fit's tight enough that everything looked okay. That bra is not so great, but if you are wearing a clothing item that is fitted over it the sticky bra, it can be good for an opened back style that you want to eliminate straps for.. This dress was tight in the bust but had a very flattering A-line to it. I received many compliments on this dress and WOULD wear it again to a rehearsal dinner but would not recommend it as a ""second look"" dress because the arms are tight and would limit your ability to dance party as you should at your wedding!","December 1, 2017","Small"

I am athletic and have ""yoga arms"" and I could not lift my arms beyond shoulder height in this dress. Luckily it was my day to order other people around anyway!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN32","RTR Customer","Gorgeous dress for a bridal shower!!","I wore this dress for my bridal shower and I have to say, it was a huge hit with everyone including myself! I was nervous since this was my first ever rental from RTR, but everything was smooth and easy. Based on reviews, I ordered my standard size 6 and a backup size 8. When the dresses arrived, I tried on the 8 first and it did fit well enough that I could have worn it; however, the 6 fit better in my chest area (small-chested) and I chose to wear that size to my shower. As people have mentioned, it is tight in the arm area if you try to raise your arms above shoulder height, but that was not an issue for me since I wasn't planning on raising my arms for any extended amount of time. I also was able to wear a strapless bra, and just tucked the back down into the dress--no problem!

Fits tall people like me excellent. The only downside was the whole renting experience. They sent me a damaged item.

I felt beautiful & a bit like a late 1960s-early 1970s Barbie doll / Goldie Hawn! If I didn't have so many upcoming medical expenses, I'd purchase it so fast! I might have to rent it again when my finances are looser so I can do just that actually! Another win from ML, but definitely know that all dresses by ML are junior sizing so you must size up at least one size if you are at all curvy (& not even plus size curvy, just in general, curvy) but it's always worth it. Such romantic, feminine pieces that manage to have an edgy feel to them still somehow. I chose to not wear a bra with it as it's structured enough to look and feel best with no bra and I am not a small busted woman saying this- I'm a 36D/DD (depending on the bra maker for the most part!) and felt very supported without a bra and suffered no aesthetic appeal with this choice.","January 24, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL238","Cara","A fine dress","Pros: broad appeal, would work in a lot of situations with multiple audiences. Cons: ML's dresses run small, especially through the hips in the fitted dresses. That's true for this dress. Other notes: it's not an exciting dress, I could see it for a night time summer party or event where it's warm out and you want something a little different, but for what I was looking for it didn't do it.","December 23, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL238","Heather","Classy but not quite as pictured","I sized up in this dress after reading other reviews. I might have been happier with the smaller size, but there is no stretch to the dress at all so it would have been a close thing. That said, it was big at the waist so I felt somewhat shapeless in the waist but didn't have a belt that worked. I didn't get a full length shot, but included the picture of the neckline to show that there isn't as much contrast at the neck as I was expecting from the picture. I was pleased but not thrilled. Fun for a date night at the symphony but too plain for the holiday party I had originally planned to wear it at.","December 23, 2018","Date"

I wore this during a friend's 40th Birthday weekend for dinner and dancing at a resort, but I feel like it could really go anywhere, depending on how much you want to dress it up. The cut was very comfortable, although it has zero stretch, so you'll probably want to size up for your backup size. I was able to wear a nude regular bra with straps and it was practically invisible even in person, but that might only be because I'm so pale that my skin AND bra matched the ivory on the dress. Standard strapless would work best. Fabric is substantial (though somewhat stiff) and will camouflage lumps/bumps, etc. Probably would've been a better dress choice for an event without dancing -- the texture of the dress didn't bother me until we started dancing, and then it rubbed the underside of my upper arms uncomfortably. Great dress to flatter an hourglass! I'm 5'10, 170ish, 36 F/G, and measure 42-34-42 for reference.","December 9, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP39","Claire","All the compliments received about how beautiful the dress was","I was very self conscious when I tried on this dress as it is low cut (my girls aren't used to being this exposed), it was one of two choices for my company's Holiday Party in late January I must have tried it on 2 - 3 times before deciding to wear it. The dress is heavy, lined (good for winter weather), the sequins were scratchy under my arms. I had to have the coat check lady zip it up the rest of the way as the zipper was stiff and unmovable in parts. As soon as I walked into the Holiday Party I received compliments on how beautiful the dress was and how great I looked (some people even gasped - I only wear pants to work)! I have lost 37 lbs since the last Holiday Party and wanted to show off my hard work - this dress was perfect for that! I am 5' 10"" and the dress came to just below my knees - was the perfect length. While wearing it I didn't notice how heavy it was and the sequins scratching under my arms didn't bother me since I was basking in all of the compliments received. If you rent this dress you will feel beautiful, very confident and know you look your best. I did not wear any shapewear as the dress was very fitted.

The neckline is a little low and shows off the girls without being inappropriate ( I am 53 years old and didn't feel uncomfortable with the amount shown) and you can wear a bra without anything showing. The dress is a little heavy due to all of the beading, but you can still dance and move in it. This dress would be great for any formal event or a mother of the groom.

I thought the length would be a little odd for someone my height (5' 4"") but with heels it worked well. I ordered a MR and LR and ended up going with the MR with some shapewear underneath.

However, the medium fit great in the top but my thick thighs were not having it. Had the dress had a little bit more stretch, I could have pulled off the medium...but there's nothing sexy about not being able to walk or dance at a wedding reception. But this is a constant problem for me...so if you're hour glass or well endowed, follow the fashion rule and get dressed for the largest portion of your body and let the rest fall into place (if tailoring isn't an option).","May 2, 2019","True to Size"

It might not be great for summer as the fabric is heavy but I'm always cold and was not in this. Zipper is a bit stiff and you might need someone else to do those last few inches.

That being said, a) the dress runs big (it is very stretchy) or b) I lost weight since. Regardless I was able to fit the L easily and think I could have worn a medium if I had ordered it. Definitely size down for your backup. The material is thick, heavy and had a good amount of stretch so I found it to be super flattering on me without the use of shapewear. The dress hits below the knees and to the top of my calves. For reference, I'm 5'9"" with long legs. The neckline was very deep and showed a lot of cleavage, but I was able to wear my regular bra with it. The sequins didn't scratch at all and the dress was super comfortable.

The main problem with this dress is the sequins. I had SO MUCH RUB. I think it's because they're so tiny. They're just like little knives in your under arm. I won't rent this again.

There is a puffiness to the shoulder, which I knew obviously from the picture, but the whole sleeve felt like it could be tighter below the shoulder puff.

One thing to note that I wasn't aware of from the images and reviews - this dress has a bit of a train - which in my very-crowded event got stepped on a couple times.

The top closes tightly under the arms and has a clasp above the zipper to secure it. However, the top did slide down a bit on me during the evening - perhaps something that could have been solved with a better strapless bra (and which may not be a problem for those with bigger chests).

Fit: I usually wear a 0-2, and I had to wear the 2 as I felt the 0 was too snug for the event. Order a size up! Although the dress is more of a midi-length, wearing a pair of heels balanced it out. Color: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful spring color! Not too bright or distracting, but it enhances every skin tone. Great fabric on the inner lining and exterior. Arrived on time, clean, and pressed. Overall, the best RTR yet. I look forward to finding another event to wear this to! Wish I had remembered to take a better picture.","May 19, 2019","Small"

As you can see from the different photos I posted, it moves with you, and gives freely in all the right places. It looks great when standing with it hanging straight, but still keeps it's charm when you're bending and moving. It's a solid thick material, with a lining, so you feel protected and don't feel like you're revealing anything. The only con I had was that the design of the breast area made me look like I had nips, but it could be worse than that. I would rent it again.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CS45","RTR Customer","Dance your tush off","Rented this for a friends wedding. It was actually my back up dress after my first dress was unavailable to ship last minute :/ and my second pick was soo snug I didn't feel comfortable wearing it (cinq a sept- pink Luna in 10 and 12)...this was the replacement I picked for my unavailable dress and it worked out great. Rich color and heavy (but not too heavy) fabric. It had a decent give to allow for some thigh and booty as I am very much a pear. However I found the top to ride up against my neck because my 34c wasn't enough to fill out the top. This was mitigated by wearing a strapless bra and a padded stick on cups. I can't complain as it gave me a true hourglass figure. I literally got danced for hours and while I was not dropping it to the floor, I was gettin down I felt pretty unrestricted. I wore spanx but not sure it was necessary with this dress. The weather ended up being cooler but I felt comfortable with the thick fabric and brought a shawl that I didn't need. This dress is perfect for girls that got a little extra in the trunk and if you're full on top you could get that hint of side boob in an otherwise modest but sexy dress. However it is fitted through the waist so I'd say top heavy, hourglass or pears can rock this one best.","October 31, 2018","Wedding"

The dress material was thick, super comfortable, and well lined. I have a long-waist so the dress kept developing a fold over my stomach (you can see it in my photo) that I felt like I was tugging at all night. I also think this dress would be more flattering on someone with a larger bust size than my B-cups.

The neckline goes up pretty far so being a bit on the busty side, i felt it make my boobs look really low on my body. I am usually a small but after reading the reviews, i sized up. Really glad I did because this dress has the potential of being short.","May 19, 2019","Party"

Super FUN standout dress!!","I LOVED this dress & had been waiting for it, for a while on my Unlimited....it was worth the wait as it was remarkable, unique & very fun to wear. I wore the medium with zero room to spare, it fit like a glove & was a major challenge to get the zipper up. No room for a bra, which thankfully I did not need it holds you in tight. The fabric is heavy, almost like a linen sunbrella so it could be a nice transitional fall dress, depending on accessories, the pom pom details on the shoulders are super cute & not over the top. One other very important note....it is SHORT, I am 5'4"" it hit me pretty high up in back....like don't bend over, short. Thankfully the ruffle is a cute distraction.

Basically, however far your boobs go out is where the rest of it will fall so all of you will look however wide your chest is. If you're looking for easy casual fit, you can definitely wear as -is. Its a fun top just know its not going to be slimming. I wanted a little more shape so I belted it.

The print is very colorful and eye catching. It would be great for a causal office, going out, or everyday. I tried it with black skinnys but it looked best with jeans. It needs to be worn with a racer back style bra or strapless due to the cut of the arms. I usually take a small or medium in tops. The small was unavailable and previous reviews said this ran large so I opted to try the XS and it fit OK, but the small would have been better because the pleats would have fallen better through the bust and I think the length might have been a little longer.

I'd purchased some fashion tape hem tape but didn't feel the need to use it. It's super stretchy, so you can easily go down a size, possibly two. The sequins weren't scratchy in the least and it was the most comfortable dress I've ever worn!! I recommend wearing a good strapless bra.

However, it ended up working beautifully and photographed really well. It’s not so tight that it’s uncomfortable but just the right about of stretch where you can move. This is my third time renting a Badgley Mischka dress and they always fit so perfectly. Only issue was my updo was low and kept getting caught on the sequins on the top part of the back of the dress.

Wearing the dress loose is not advisable it will shift off center in the back, and the top part will expose your chest! Nevertheless I looked and felt like a star the whole night and got complimented by everyone who saw me. I recommend light jewelry and neutral stilettos. Cannot recommend this dress enough!!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM423","RTR Customer","NOT PERFECT! BUT WORTH IT!","So my friend decided to have us rent our bridesmaid dresses for her wedding. I panicked due to having to order online without trying it on. I ordered a 20WL and 22WR. I was freaking out that they wouldn't fit. Due to being a more curvier woman I ordered larger sizes expecting it to run small due to the mix reviews. I was able to have my dress delivered to the hotel and it arrived in a cute tote. When I finally tried the dress on to my surprise they ran larger. I ordered the 20WL and being only 5'7 it came to my ankle, which was disappointing. It was also larger in the bust area which was surprising with my 42 DDD bust. I tried on the 22WR and found it to be a tad shorter then the prior dress and even larger throughout the dress. Overall the color and fit was very flattering. The slit in the back allows you to move and even though the materiel is thicker the dress is pretty light weight. Some simple body shaper will do the job and I would wear shorter heels if you want the dress to be longer.","May 29, 2019","Wedding"

I didn’t wear a regular bra for fear that it would peak out the sides (that drooped slightly lower than expected) but I was able to wear a strapless bra, and it was perfect.

I have an hourglass figure, a 34DDD bust. Literally the only dress I have ever worn that 'de' accentuated my chest, despite having a high neckline! The ruffling in the front creates a gorgeous silhouette that is light and airy, the band at the waist accentuates an hourglass figure and shows off our great curves.

The only reason I did not give five stars is the bottom of the dress is not the most flattering. There are a couple different tiers/layers of fabric at bottom, and the effect of such is that it looks a little bunched. Still a stunning red dress, just would have preferred there not be the different tiers of fabric at the bottom.","February 12, 2018","True to Size"

I am a size 12 comfortably in all other clothes, but this ran a little small. I got it zipped up, but I ended up wanting to change right out of it after eating a few Christmas apps.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMR23","Natalie","Perfect choice for my 40th birthday celebration!","Perfect mix of flirty, but sophisticated, this dress wears like a dream. It runs a size small IMO, as I usually wear a 0, but the 2 fit perfectly. The color is more rust than red, which was a surprise, but I'm an auburn so it worked out great. It was so comfortable to wear, nice heavy weight, and no tugging on it all night. My only complaint (besides having to return it!) is that the zipper is terrible. I was careful not to get the textured fabric caught in it, but despite that, it took both my husband and I wrestling with it to get it up and down. I predict there will be some broken zipper accidents with this style, which is a shame. Definitely attach both hook and eyes first and then just try to be patient to coax that sucker up. :)","December 24, 2017","Party"

Be aware that, because of the lightweight fabric, you'll want Spanx or nylons or something similar underneath. The detailing is beautiful up close and the fit is true to size. I didn't have a problem with the sleeves/neckline being scratchy or difficult to fold, but I suppose that if you go with your smaller size then both of these could become an issue (or if you have wide shoulders).","December 4, 2018","True to Size"

Probably should have ordered one size smaller but this dress was stunning even a little too big! I felt great wearing it and got complements all night long. We forgot photos at the beginning of the evening and this one with my bestie was snapped just moments before the last dance. I loved how it looked even seven hours later (and some of them overheated since it was an outdoor event and was 87 degrees when we started).

I am 110lbs 5'2 petite 32dd and have a butt. I gave my measurements and the rep said I was a size 16 based on my curvy measurements. I always wear either a 0 or 2 on dresses. Well to the rep that made me feel fat because I have curves! the zero fit perfect but I wore the 2 because I felt it was little loser on my butt.

I wasn't sure how the mid-calf length would look, but the flare is perfect and I found it quite flattering. I was able to wear a strapless bra with it, with no issue. There is one detail that I didn't notice when ordering the dress, which is a very thin cut-out, almost crochet-like, line under the bust and again vertically in the middle of the chest. It's subtle, but you can see skin and bra through it. I was a little apprehensive when first trying it on, but especially if you're in a party or wedding setting, where it's dark and there are lots of people, it's pretty much a non-issue.","January 22, 2020","True to Size"

My only issue was that the neck was just a little bit tight, but not enough to be a problem after ~4 hours (and several drinks).

It wasn't tight at the bottom so it felt comfortable to sit down in and to dance. The one thing I will note is that if you have a bigger bust, you may want to size up or be careful seeing as the top part is a bit narrow.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL240","Laneigh","This. Dress. Was. BOMB. I wore it for a ball and EVERYONE complimented me!","Being designer and a formal dress, it ran small and not street size (NO idea why they all do this) so I wore the larger size. But it was tight enough that even with my large and not-perky breasts, I didn't need a bra with it! It nipped in at my waist, flared out over my stomach, and had pockets for my phone and lip gloss. The color was deep and felt expensive, the lace detailing on the sleeve was to-die for, and the cleavage was just enough to be sexy without being inappropriate. I wanted to cry when I had to return it! I SO would rent this dress again!","January 21, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL240","RTR Customer","Loved the sleeves! They were nice and wide so you could actually move your arms around.","As other have said the top runs a little loose. I opted to wear the larger size even though the smaller one fit better over all because the waist band has no stretch to it and I carry a lot of weight around my middle. That meant the too was loose but some double sided dress taped helped keep it down and not gap.","January 13, 2019","True to Size"

The top is tight so if you're big busted (I'm a 38DD) then go with the next size up... that worked great for me.","December 23, 2018","Formal Affair"

Only problem was my bra kept showing in the front of the dress, this could have been my fault in choice of bra. Got a lot of compliments and was warm enough in a winter wedding for short periods of time outside. Just stunning.","December 22, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL240","Rachel","Looks great, has pockets!!","This dress was perfect for a formal holiday gala. I got too many compliments to count! The length of the 6R definitely requires heels. My shoes were almost too short, so if in doubt, go taller with your shoes. I usually wear a 4/6 and the 6R fit perfectly. Like others have said, it's tight in the chest and you'll need a strapless bra since the sleeves are lace over the shoulders. The sleeves weren't too tight, which was a nice change from most dresses off the rack. Overall it was very comfortable when standing, and a little tight in the chest/waist when sitting, but I wouldn't have gone up a size due to the length. My favorite part was the pockets. Oh, the pockets! Large enough for my iPhone 8 Plus, and designed in such a way that you could actually use the pockets without adding bulk or odd shapes to your silhouette. Perfect! The outer fabric was nice and thick, and the inner layer kept the crinoline off my legs, and stayed put nicely. My only complaint is that the dress arrived wrinkled and I had a difficult time getting it straightened out. I might recommend doing an 8 day rental to give yourself extra time to hang it up or take it to the cleaners to have it pressed. Since mine arrived the night before the party, I didn't have many options. One last warning, the skirt is deceptively full, making getting in and out of a car an interesting experience. Plan accordingly!","December 20, 2018","True to Size"

In terms of sizing, the size 8 fit me perfectly (I typically wear a size 6 in casual dresses and size 8/10 in formal gowns). The material definitely has no give, but was fortunately thick enough where I didn't need to wear a bra. Lengthwise, the dress came slightly off the floor with 3"" heels.

Perfect for Labor Day wedding.","I chose a photo that illustrated that the straps can be worn up or down. I'm an older woman and the photo of the model made it look very revealing. But it doesn't have to be! It is so fitted at waist that I wore the larger of the sizes. I am small on top but bigger on the bottom and the tight waist emphasized that, so up a size I went, and it was perfect. Wore with nude sandals, but gold shoes and bag would be nice, too. GET IT!","September 4, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG65","RTR Customer","Wore this to an outdoor August wedding and got SO many compliments, from men and women alike.","The material is sturdy but very stretchy. I wore a size 4 which fit me just fine, but I almost wish I'd been able to try the 2 as the excess stretch/give caused the dress to gather a bit every now and then around my waste and narrower hips. But then again a smaller size may have been less forgiving on the old love handles and panty line. Because of the light color you do have to be a bit careful with underwear color and texture. In spite of the sturdy material and length of the dress, it was fairly breathable and with the open shoulders I stayed pretty cool out in the sun on an 80-something degree day. Not sure whether it was my new strapless bra or the dress itself, but I only found myself pulling it up twice over the course of a 6-7 hour event, which for me and strapless dresses is a major record. I think because the dress is so form-fitting the whole gravity factor is minimized and it tends to stay put. What's more, the little ""sleeves"" pop up onto your shoulders easily and still look pretty dang cute, making dancing a non-issue. I felt simultaneously classy and sexy and comfortable in this dress the whole night...would definitely rent it again.","August 28, 2019","True to Size"

I chose it because every woman I saw in the reviews wore it well, it literally looked great on everyone so why not me?! The shoulders were a tad restricting, but I am very broad shouldered so it was probably just me. I also don't believe this dress was meant to do a lot of moving in. The bottom left seam couldn't seem to find a comfortable spot to sit so it kept bunching up, but it could also be because of the cut. I am normally a 4, but chose a 2 because I have been losing a little weight. It seemed as if the last person to wear it should have gotten a 4, as it was stretched out around the waist and behind area, but still very manageable! Wonderful dress!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ117","Brittany","A modern twist on classic white","I didn't wear this as it was part of my unlimited RTR shipment because it was so big in the waist! The fit on top was a little big as well. I do have a small upper frame but was disappointed because the brand normally fits perfect. The material and seam are quality and does not show through, which is always a concern with a white dress.","August 2, 2016","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ117","Isabel","RTR Team Review","I love this Elizabeth and James dress! They never disappoint! The dress has a great feel to it yet the material does not have any stretch to it. Thus, running true to size, I would recommend sizing up for backup if you’re curvier and down if you’re smaller framed. There is a lot of room in the midsection, but it can be a bit tight on the sleeves and on the skirt slip for women with fuller hips. The fabric is not sheer yet I would suggest using nude undergarments just in case. You are able to wear a standard bra with it. My favorite part is the pockets! Who does not love a dress with hidden pockets?! Always a plus! I also love the key-hole neckline, but it can be tricky for those of you with fuller busts. Pair this dress with some sandals or sneakers and you will look amazing, Wear it for work, brunch, or any summer day! Can’t wait to rent it again!","June 29, 2016","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ117","Tatianna","Stylist Review","Sweet dress for a summer day! Running on the larger size, we recommend ordering a size down for backup. The fabric does not have much stretch, but it is comfortable with a roomy fit. With a tighter fit in the bust, this piece is best for A-C cup sizes. The cinched waist creates a hourglass shape on all body types. Those with fuller hips will look great in this look with a full skirt. The dress hits above my knees on my 5'1 frame. This piece is great for everyday wear or a casual summer event. Dress it down with ballet flats or dress it up with wedges and gold jewelry.","April 20, 2016","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YK50","Sarah","Silky elegance in the perfect fall floral","I love Yumi Kim's silk print rompers and knew this dress would be a quality backup to my original first choice. Short girls, I know you're reading my review to see if this will work for you and the answer is yes! I prefer maxis to hit the top of my feet and in four-inch satin evening sandals, the dress still ran a tad longer than that. Because of the fall of the wrap and the lightweight fabric, I was still able to walk around without tripping on a dragging hemline. However, the skirt has a sheer poly lining that drops a little lower than the outer silk fabric, so just for insurance I used fashion tape to tack up the liner. Otherwise, the dress fit as expected without gaping or sliding around the cleavage and plenty of fabric on the wrap to cover my wider than average hips. I enjoyed that when seated with your legs crossed, the fabric tends to slide back and show a little leg. This dress was the perfect solution for a 4 o'clock semi-formal wedding and I felt like I stood apart from the crowd. It's Rita Hayworth sexy--classic, glamorous, and just a little exotic.","October 31, 2018","True to Size"

I guess it would be perfect if you were over 5'10"". I am between a size 12 and a 14 and the waist was perfect. If you are any bigger than that you will risk not having enough overlap.

The fabric is thick & stretchy, maybe the dress runs a smidge large because I zipped it up and didnt experience any cinching sensation, although the fit looked appropriate. I would have bought except the raw-edge hem looks a bit worn. There is a pretty short slit in the rear but it didn't cause me problems. I wore a Wacoal Red Carpet strapless bra.

This was slightly surprising considering I am a 36DD, but I didn't like the way my bust looked wearing a Nubra, and you could see a regular bra through the slits on the side.

This lightweight, silky fabric falls in all the right places with zero cling or static. I love the classy, high neckline and the twist detail at the waist brings it together, flattering the figure with no need for a belt. The longer skirt comes up slightly in the middle for some leg peak and lovely flow when you walk, but nothing close to the anxiety a true wrap dress/skirt can cause on a windy day. The fit is somewhat loose all over, but looks so pulled together on. I've rented this twice already and I look forward to wearing again in the future.","July 30, 2019","True to Size"

Lovely material - not transparent. However, as it's silk and the air is dry where I live, static was unavoidable. That aside, it's a beautiful dress!

It had a muted sparkle throughout the fabric which was definitely my favorite part! Plus, the dress is two layers of thick material that make it feel substantial enough (and not see through). However, I would not recommend this dress to ladies with large chests. I am a 36D and went braless - and the fit was perfect. But I do feel like if I was wearing this, I might be a little paranoid because it doesn't quite leave you feeling covered and secure. The inside top does have a strip of rubbery material that helps it stay in place, which helped, but just be warned! Also, I am 5'8' and was wearing a 2"" heel in this Photo, and the dress just perfectly brushed the ground.","April 9, 2019","Formal Affair"

I would say to try on in store or get at least one size up (may two if you have a larger bust). The dress is A-line so sizing up won't make much difference at the bottom of the gown. I am wearing 4 inch heels in the picture and at my height the dress was still long and I had to pick up in the front to walk.

As other reviewers mentioned the top is really tight around the rib cage and a little difficult to zip especially if you don’t have any help. Not even a question of boobs, it was really the under boob circumference that I found small. The other issue was that even with 4 inch heels, this dress was still pretty long.

I am just under 5'7"", wore 3 inch heels, and the dress was still long; by at least 2-3 inches.

I thought the quality and cut was lovely. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the yellow is a little harsh. It has slightly blue undertones, especially on the yellow ribbon near the bottom. To me, the color cheapens the overall effect. I don't wear much yellow, because it's hard to flatter my fair skin, but I defiantly wouldn't have even tried it on in a store. If you can wear yellow, you can probably rock this dress!","September 16, 2018","Everyday"

I wore the dress to an outdoor wedding at a farm on a hot summer day. The fabric is incredible for dancing - it flows so nicely, I just wanted to spin and twirl in it all night. I think the dress ran a little loose, which I liked; I wore the 0R and was able to adjust it to fit me perfectly with the tie. The dress has great coverage and lining so I did not need to wear a bra (32B), but also didn't feel flattened out. It has a beautiful, bright pattern and adorable buttons down the back. I got compliments all night. My one complaint is that the lining of the dress in the front turned out a bit, so you could see a small bit of the lining on one side of the v-neck. It probably could have been fixed with an iron or fashion tape, but sadly I didn't have either. I wish I could keep this dress and would definitely rent it again!","June 18, 2018","True to Size"

I was pretty bummed that I didn't get to wear my first pick, but I ended up really liking this look. The fabric itself is gorgeous, and the heavy weight of the lace was great for a November wedding. The sleeves hit just the right spot on my wrists, the length was good, and I liked how it fit around my waist and hips. The fit on top was a little less great since I have a small chest and somewhat broad shoulders. This style doesn't really allow for a bra or other padding, so the fabric was a bit loose around the chest (though thick enough to provide coverage). The shoulders were a little snug, too, so I couldn't really raise my arms above my head while dancing, but I think I would have had that issue with any long-sleeved dress. Overall, I loved how it looked, but wish I could have worn a style with a little more movement to it.","November 14, 2017","True to Size"

The color and texture make the dress unique. It fits pretty true to size - I am usually a size 4 in dresses, this one is body hugging which usually makes me size up to a 6, but this dress fit fine in the 4. One note would be that if you tend to carry your weight in your butt/thighs, this can definitely get a bit tight after hours of wear so wear spandex or something to keep your legs from becoming chafe city.","November 6, 2017","True to Size"

I'm tall and have hips, so was relieved to find a dress that accentuated all the right spots without hugging too tightly. The lace is stunning, but a little stiff up top. I found the fit on the bottom more flattering than the fit in the arms. I was grateful, though, for the long sleeves in icy weather!

If comfort is your thing, this may not be for you. 2. I'm short and this dress hit a bit past my knee. It could have the tendency to swallow you but high heels help balance the look. 3. If you waiver between sizes, size up. My back and shoulders are slightly broad and this dress was super snug, and at times uncomfortable. For me sizing up would not have worked because this fit perfect from the waist down. 4. The lace has a shimmer to it. Fine for me but some may feel this is too dressy for work.

The green lace did not have any stretch, but the skirt portion did. A regular bra could absolutely be worn. No need for special panties either.

I'm usually a size 6 but fit in a size 4 and it was still comfy. The ruffle at the waist does make any belly fat look minimally bigger since the ruffle flows over when you're looking down at it but it visually disguises any slight belly you may have since it looks like it's just part of the ruffle from an observer's perspective.","April 9, 2018","Large"

Running true to size, we recommend going one size up for backup, as the fabric has no stretch. If you are smaller-framed or wear petite sizes, you may want to size down as this can run long and may run a big large on smaller frames. This dress is great for any bust size and falls straight at the waist and hips. The sleeves are fitted around the wrists and I loved how this made the dress stand out! At 5’6”, this hit just about the knee for me and I would recommend pairing with a colorful statement purse and black heels for a simple, go-to work outfit.","March 8, 2018","True to Size"

So I would suggest sizing up if you're blessed like I am! :-) Also, the bigger size didn't make the split too high as well. The only issue with this dress is that it's not a bright white.

The off-white color even worked with my fair skin. I'm kind of oddly proportioned, so this just didn't work on me. The 10 fit on top but was too snug in the hips, and the 12 was too loose in the top which makes the cutout look weird. The torso fit was too long for me- which is weird, since I also have a long torso. Just taking this selfie for my boyfriend took a lot of twisting and standing a certain way, so I know I would have been tugging and adjusting this dress all night. I say this one is worth trying for, but pick a backup style that's a safe fallback.","January 24, 2018","Party"

Nonetheless this dress was gorgeous and the colors for were stunning for my Caribbean vacation! I wore a Victoria's Secret body by VS push up bra with this dress. Ladies do keep in mind this is a wrap dress and how you sit/ cross your legs will open the wrap dress from the bottom especially if your someplace extra windy, like a beach for example. This dress looks beautiful in wind but too much wind and everyone else will see all your goodies. Also keep in mind ordering the long bs the regular. I'm 5'6 1/2 and I order the long vs the regular.

I tried it on at the LA store and really fell in love, but ended up opting for another dress for the actual event so I could wear flats. This dress definitely deserves heels and I just didn't have it in me this time lol. Because the back is out, you can't really wear a bra with it, so be prepared to tuck the girls in tight with some tape unless you were blessed with some gravity-defying twins. Overall, super cute and fits true to size. If you're curvier, I rec sizing down if you want more cinch to your waist. The booty has plenty of room bc it's an open flare, so don't worry.","October 5, 2018","True to Size"

Running true size with little stretch, I recommend wearing one size up for your back up size. The style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works for al cup sizes. You are able to wear a standard bra with this pink lace dress. At 5'9, this hit mid thigh on me. Pair with a shirt stack heel and you have a perfect date night outfit.","September 30, 2018","True to Size"

It is noticeable and a bit flashy because of the silver but not TOO over the top. It's also nice because it's flattering and forgiving. I had a birthday dinner, complete with dessert, while wearing this, and didn't feel squished or self-conscious!

I'm 5'4"" with a built, athletic frame. I felt that it was very loose when I wore the medium but the small (while it zipped and was comfortable) was too short for my backside. I think that it would be more flattering on a more slim build or a taller person. It was still a fun New Years outfit and I'm glad I tried it.","January 12, 2019","Party"

Very easy to get in and out of as rompers go. Minor complaint/warning - the back has a strap with a hook clasp that comes undone frequently (especially if you are stretching, kicking and dancing as much as we were) and it is quite low cut so a regular strapless will not work. I got a stick-on cutlet with a deep-v center that worked nicely. Sleeves were very long but easy to tuck in. Perfect for a night out in Vegas!","July 27, 2018","True to Size"

While the shoulders were a little loose/shifty and the sleeves a tad long, the overall fit was great! The clasp in the back wouldn't stay locked, which I just attribute to the loose shoulder area, but thats nothing tieing couldnt fix. The romper was super comfortable to move around in, especially for those that love to dance! I had a great time and got lots of compliments so I would definitely recommend this!

It was super comfortable and it was very fitting to celebrate the new year.","I wore this dress for a new year's eve party and it was perfect for the occasion. I got so many compliments! It is a little short, but I wore black tights underneath to make it more appropriate. The sleeves were a little long and the overall fit was mainly true to size, but I wish I could've gotten a small so that the sleeves weren't as long. If you don't like wearing things tight, I would recommend staying with your normal size, but I had enough room to where I think I would have fit in a small. The romper also showed a lot of cleavage and back. The romper had a zipper and two strings you can tie on your back. Overall, I LOVED this dress considering how cold it was on new year's eve. I would definitely recommend this dress if you don't like things tight on you, but also want to look trendy and sparkly for a nice party! :)","January 2, 2018","True to Size"

It fits well in the bottom but the top is HUGE! There is also a strap in the back across the top but it kept coming loose so I gave up on it by the end of the night. You can wear a bra with this because the straps are hidden but since I don't really need one I opted not to. The color is in between gold and silver so I think it's perfectly elegantly understated.

I'm usually between a small and medium so I went with the medium because it fit better. It does have a lower back but i was able to wear a regular bra.

The embroidery is incredibly luxurious and I loved how the skirt fanned out a bit.

I loved the style - the lining is a tad short but the sheer ruffles were long enough that I didn't mind. I normally wear a 14 in most sizes - the 16 just fit through the waist and bottom. There's a little stretch but not much. I wear a 36D and this dress was a teensy bit large on top - I could wear a strapless bra though it showed a bit on the side if I wasn't careful but if you had a black one, I don't think you'd even notice. Style-wise - the embroidery was gorgeous and the ruffles were a great silhouette on bottom if you want to avoid a sheath.

Such a gorgeous dress!!","October 17, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN160","Talia","Perfect fall wedding look!","I am obsessed with this dress. The bodice was tight, so I definitely had to size up. The bust area was actually pretty big for me, but I was still able to wear without a bra. The cut is so flattering - no shapewear needed, and it just brings you in and creates such a flattering silhoutte. The embroidery is delicate and beautiful. One my my all-time favorite rentals.","October 15, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN160","Merry","Not my favorite, but it was pretty cute!","This dress was pretty cute. It was a back up when my first choice didn't fit. I'm usually a size 8/10 but I wore the 12 and it fit perfectly. It was easy to wear with a strapless bra. It hid any tummy issues that I had, because the tiered bottom isn't clingy at all.

I am 5' 2"", 125 lbs., and the 0 fit perfectly. It's a great length even on petites, shows off the shoulders nicely, and is forgiving where it counts for me (hips/butt area). You can't see in pictures, but there are metallic gold and silver threads in the embroidery that makes the dress look so fancy and expensive. Highly recommend.","September 24, 2018","True to Size"

My daughter (who wore this to prom) is 5'3"" and weighs 140 pounds (though solid muscle from years of sports). Fit is best for a small chested and thin or athletic girl. If you have a broad torso or full chest, this may not be the best cut for you. (See the swimmer's review). The dress was elegant and she got multiple compliments. No one had a dress like it.

It wan a bit larger than I wanted at the sides where it was cutout, but better to be a little loose than too snug in my opinion. I think I read a review somewhere that the straps are adjustable-- they are not. But they fit well on me! Gorgeous and flattering. The first dress that I for had a broken clasp but RTR overnighted this one to me and it worked out great- they were very apologetic and wanted to make it right.

The only thing that was a bit of a bummer is that i thought i would be able to get away with no bra, but my boobs didnt quite fill the top peice out on their own so i needed a sticky bra. So, if you are smaller chested you might want to try sizing down or make sure you have some sticky cutlets. All in all this dress was amazing, the material, the color, everything!

At 5'5"" with 2 inch heels it was still a bit long but not too bad. Overall would recommend.","December 16, 2018","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JS117","Kristin","Sexy, but Not Too Sexy!","I rented this for a formal Christmas party. It truly fit like a glove, and the fabric had enough weight and stretch that it felt like it kept everything pulled in nicely. Spanx helped smooth everything out nicely because of the body hugging nature of the dress it was necessary. I also felt like my posture improved that night because I was very aware to stand up straight. If I didn't I worried my back fat might roll out the side cut outs! Ha ha! Bottom line unless you are stick thin, you need confidence and good posture to wear this dress! Fortunately I was feeling confident and it must have shown as I received many compliments. Lots of ""hot mammas"" and ""sexy"" but I never felt overtly sexy, it was a subtle sexy. Overall, good rental but not my favorite.","December 6, 2018","Formal Affair"

I originally ordered the 6R and it fit perfectly, but I felt that the size 8R would be much more comfortable. The dress was a hit and I was showered with compliments all night. The only downside of this dress was the latches on the back. Now, I had it originally on the smallest it would go comfortably, but I noticed right away that the latches didn't seem to be on there very well. Sure enough, the first set literally came completely off. I re-latched it to the second row, and not even an hour later, those came off too!

I chose a shorter more ""wedding guest"" style. I am a 34D and I did not have to squeeze into the top. I thought everything fit perfect.

I have a small waist and small chest so the 0R was snug but not uncomfortable. The hips were a tiny tight but still looked great. I was able to attend the ceremony, bar hop downtown, and then dance the night away comfortably. I got a TON of compliments, people kept telling me I had to buy that dress! I totally would if it wasn't so expensive. I felt like a million bucks and would rent again in a heartbeat. I would have liked to try the size 2 as I think that one would have been perfect. I am just shy of 5'8"" and I wore 2 1/2"" heals and I would have liked to have seen the long option.

Although the fabric has a bit of a stretch, the dress is form fitting and not that forgiving. I didn't need to wear a bra which was a plus. Also, usually I can get away with flats in R dresses but you absolutely need at least 2 in heels and even then I was still picking it up occasionally. Overall, I loved the dress and would rent again.

Material: Lightweight, soft, very comfortable. It was easy to style and didn't bunch when tucked in. Fit: I absolutely hated the neckline. It was constantly flopping forward and was really unreliable. Style: The sleeves are so fun! I really enjoyed the step up from your average bell sleeve. I am 5'9"" and 165 pounds, a G/H cup, and early in my first trimester. I have a long torso and long arms, narrow rib cage. I rented a 10 in this top. I thought it fit true to size and the sleeve length was perfect given my height. I can see how someone shorter would struggle with this, however. All around, really enjoyed this one!

It was slightly baggy and I had some trouble keeping up the top, but just the fact that I actually could wear a jumper felt amazing! I actually like the look of it being a little loose since it was more slendering. My problem areas are typically my booty and thighs and this fit great in both of those areas. I think if you are busty (below a DD) this dress would be fine. I wore this to a double header of a black tie early in the night and then to another cocktail party later.

It's a bit tricky to zip by yourself over the band in middle, so bring a friend with you to the ladies room!! I wore the long, with heels. I have very long legs in correlation with the rest of my body and I could've easily gotten away with the regular length without heels. The longs are LONG.

Smaller chested women will have no problems. The straps are adjustable too! The rest of the dress fit very well. Had some space in the stomach area so eating and dancing were fine. The butt had some space too, only place the dress was too large for me. My boyfriend loved the dress and I got so many compliments. The cut out in the front is hot and this dress is a dream.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JS113","Maria","Love the Style!","Pros: 5 stars for unique and sexy style. Not boring but not over the top. Wore to a friend's wedding. Might not be for a super conservative wedding. Depends on how you fit into the dress. Top is cut for smaller busts (at least the 0 and 2 were). Wore a black nu bra (must be black to blend in with the top where they meet). Length worked because the top is so showy. Needed the length to bring the sophistication. Wore with almost 4 inch heels, which helped to balance the length. Many compliments! Color blocking was so modern and loved that part too. Cons: Needed 10 minutes to situate myself in the dress with the nu bra, adjusting straps to avoid under boob cleavage (didn't know that was a thing until this rental), also used fashion tape to keep the nu bra and dress top aligned. Had to size up. The 0 was way too tight in certain areas of the bottom part of the dress. It was cut for a 0 with no bottom or minimal hips. The 2 looked better on both the top and bottom, but that weird fit on the bottom still existed. Wasn't so terribly noticeable from the side. Could not tell at all from the front. Wore spanx just in case for extra security. Wouldn't have needed spanx if the bottom had a better cut. 4 stars for the bottom part's cut. Guess it was all worth it.","November 4, 2018","Wedding"

""Not so much winter, but not so much spring"" (aka ""WHAT KIND OF DRESS IS APPROPRIATE?""). Well this dress was IT. Truly answered that border-like season question.

The dress feels like it's super short and that you might be hanging out, but the ruffles cover everything. I would just be cautious sitting down and getting in/out of cars.

It actually wasn't my first choice, but it was my husband's first choice, and since he's the bday boy, i went with it. I got tons of compliments all night long! The fabric and the color are gorgeous. I'm 5'3"" 117# 32B (33-26-36) and the size 2 was too tight across the waist. The size 4 was still snug but totally doable for an all evening event. The weird part is the proportions. I found the breast area to be too low for the size 2, but better (less noticeable maybe because the fabric didn't bunch as much) on the size 4. Its great for a petite figure. Anyone over 5'5"" or someone leggy and you're in mini skirt territory. I wore with opaque-ish tights and wish I had gone with something a little less translucent since the top is visually delicate.

Also upon steaming it, I noticed a few vertical stains at the bottom, but with the excess fabric, the stains were hidden in the folds.

I am 5'8"" and an athletic 151 pounds and normally don't wear a small, but in this I did. This dress shows your legs and an arm, but even on me (with a 34DDD bust and going down to a small) it leaves room in the bust and belly. An irksome feature if you want to show your curves, but nice if you'd like to enjoy the buffet or are wanting to conceal a pooch. I did not find the sequins to be bothersome. If you have to dress alone, you can do so in this dress by zipping it all the way up and still getting it on over your head. I recommend the dress because it's a fun statement piece and as long as you size down accordingly, it should fit about anyone (under 5'10"" without showing Christmas). I do think the medium I tried on first was actually shorter than the small that I ended up wearing. Also, I do have long arms, but the sleeve length was a bit irritating; I wished it to have been either an inch shorter or longer.","March 9, 2020","Large"

The one thing I will add is that if you've got a big set of boobs there will be A LOT of cleavage shown with this dress.

No tripping just needed to be aware on steps. I think it would have been great if I was my usual weight at 130.

The length of the dress is modest but not matronly. The color is a versatile deep blue. Cons: This is a pull-over dress and might be tough for some to manage. The fabric is mostly polyester with some spandex (not very luxurious). The sleeves are a bit tight (even for my skinny arms).","May 19, 2018","True to Size"

The arms and shoulders were a little tight, and it seemed like the hips on the dress were more at my waist.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH197","Colleena","Solid workhorse piece","Followed advice on ordering one size up. This made the dress way too big. Perhaps, because I am shorter (5 foot 2 inches) , it fit differently, but I can't imagine this affecting sleeve tightness. It was biggest in the area 4 inches under the hip to the knee. It ruined the line of the dress and I don't plan to wear it. The Size 2 specifically was way too big for a normal size 0. For those comfortable with a body-conscience silhouette, don't be afraid to order your size. Here are my current and honest measurements.

The color was exactly what I needed to liven up the picture, but still be conservative in nature, the fit was incredible, and my bra straps didn't show in the cut-outs like some others experienced. Be careful because it doesn't have a zip, you put it on like you would a sweater, so I took many steps to ensure deodorant didn't stain it while putting it on, and I put a robe on over it while I did my makeup, and did my hair last since the dress is pulled over your head.

Thick fabric keeps everything in place with no worries or tugging throughout the night. At 5'7 I really needed the long, but I made it work with flat shoes. If you're thick in the hips you might want to size up, cause this dress was a tight squeeze in that area. The cutouts on the back mean no bra or shape wear, but I'm small enough on top for that not to be an issue.

I saw that in the reviews but didn't understand until I was in the bathroom stall by myself. I managed to shimmy the dress up over my tush and use the restroom and then shimmy it back down but when I got it down my panties went with. Then it was trying to fix that problem. So either you have to take the dress off to use the bathroom or go commando? Not sure Other thing was I ordered the long and it wasn't long enough compared to other dresses I've ordered long in. I'm 5'9"" and was wearing 2.5 in heals and it didn't hit the floor in the front. It would have been better if I had wore flats.","September 1, 2019","Wedding"

The fabric is thick enough that it sucked me in and didn't show every bump. I loved the hourglass shape it gave me (lots of dresses can make me look boxy). The thick straps + the deep neckline were a nice combo without showing too much skin. The back of the dress is also a fun addition. Not the easiest dress to walk in or climb stairs. Also the Long was a very nice and long fit for me at 5'11"" and I wore heals.","August 24, 2019","True to Size"

Flattering and classy and just the right amount of sexy. I've never worn a mermaid style dress and loved how it showed off the little curves I have. The only downside I found in this dress was stairs were difficult due to the mermaid style, and I needed someone to start unzipping it so I could use the bathroom since you can't pull it up (LOL). The cutout in the front is sexy but not too much. You can't wear a bra with this dress, but lift tape works perfectly and can be hidden well. The material is thick and you can tell it is a high quality dress!

I'm usually between a 4&6 and did have to size up but the 6 fit perfectly. The only weird thing is I'm 5,5 and I got the regular but it was actually decently short.

I wore it for a black tie wedding; I got a 0 and didn't get a backup because they didn't have a 2 available. I got backups in other dresses but still picked this one even though it was a bit tight because that's how much I liked it. The tightness subsided after walking and dancing, but it took a little bit. I have a small waist so it was my choice to pick this size, and I loved the fit overall, it was just a little restricting in the butt area. But it hugged my waist which the 2 probably wouldn't have done. My advice is to either go up a size if you're all-around one size, or try moving around in it before your event so you don't feel restricted. I still gave this dress 4 stars because it was that beautiful and that complimenting to my body.","April 30, 2019","True to Size"

The only complaint is the zipper. There’s a sticking point in the middle. It was a wrestling match to get it up and almost impossible to get it off at the end of the night.

I scoured all the reviews about this dress and wound up renting the 6L and 8L. In the end, I wore the 6L because it felt more secure and I didn't want to be tugging at the top.

The greatest thing is the color, which stood out in a sea of black. I don't often go for color, but am really glad I did and RTR was the perfect way to do so! I received so many compliments on this color! The only downside was the back zipper, which is a problem on and off the hanger. It is tough to zip and takes multiple tries and patience. This was true in the backup size 10 as well, which fit me, but I was more comfortable in the 12. This was my first RTR experience and it was great. I will be back!","January 1, 2019","True to Size"

It has no zipper so a bit tight to pull over your head and it is definitely straight and long. Not forgiving in any way. Ruffles are cute and fall in both sides.

So you have to pull it over your head. That wasn't really a problem it just made the fit even more odd than it already was with the asymmetry. It felt accidental how it hung asymmetrically on my body. Possibly if you had no curves it would hang like a sheath and look different, but the black ruffles on the side were ridiculous on my shape as you can see in the photos. Not for me as you can see.","October 2, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL6","Rebecca","Pretty maxi dress","Rented this for a trip to Santa Barbara with friends and wore it out to dinner one night. I have a larger chest and I liked that the neckline was sexy but also not too exposed. And I could wear a strapless bra without worrying that it would show. I would say that if I didn't have a D cup, I probably could have gone down a size, as the dress was a bit loose in the waist. On the other hand, it was nice not feeling stuffed in after dinner. The material was nice and the length was perfect with my 3 Inch wedges. My only complaint is regarding the ruffles around the neckline: They're only printed on one side, so when they flip up, or flutter in the wind (as ruffles are known to do) the white unprinted underside of the fabric is exposed, which doesn't look nice. I would expect a double sided print detail on a dress like this, that retails for over $600. The one sided print cheapens the look... I wouldn't purchase this dress for that reason, but it was fine for a rental.","June 19, 2017","Vacation"

This dress would work for any bust size however due to the front lace cutout a standard bra may show a little. There is comfortable room throughout the waist and hips.

The material was lighter than I was expecting, almost like those stretchy smocked tops from the 90s.

Instead of the red lace area being somewhat transparent, mine had a piece of black cloth sewn behind it, so the red lace appeared dark and it wasn't at all see-through. Which is a shame because I liked that feature in the dress in the photographs. Also the zipper on the back of mine stuck in a certain place; it was impossible to get on and off without help. Finally, the front armpit area is cut really oddly- resulting in unsightly overhang. I couldn't wear it. Very disappointed.","May 1, 2017","True to Size"

I chose this color because it is the same color as my wedding motif 20 years ago. Although the dress is really low-cut, I didn't feel like I was busting out of it.

Oh yeah, about sitting, I had to make sure I always had perfect posture or I'd be giving everyone a free show! I did wear a cupid plunge bra that I got from Venus but the straps in the back (along the sides of the back) were somewhat visible since the back of the dress is lace with no underlay (like the sleeves are). I really didn't care much about that. I just wanted the girls to be supported. Speaking of sleeves, they were oddly long as another reviewer mentioned but not a big deal. Overall the dress was beautiful and I was pleased with it.

I wore a nubra and fashion tape to keep the top in place. The dress is sexy with the deep V and its length but the long sleeves give it a classy touch, and kept me warm in the SF cold. There is no stretch to the dress...the ribcage area felt a bit snug but the rest of the dress was perfect, maybe a tiny bit loose even. And the pattern of the lace helps hide any problem areas.

Ultimately I was really happy with the dress, and as usual, I loved a risk-free chance to step out of my style comfort zone. Other pros: The netting of the shoulders and sleeves was comfortable, not itchy, and didn't catch on things often. Sleeves were actually long enough for my long arms. Color was gorgeous and I think would flatter many skin tones & hair colors.

It's tight, so you need to be comfortable with your figure. I didn't like how long the non-netted fabric went. I thought that part would have been shorter.

Figuring this tight fit would be cumbersome on bathroom trips, I decided to wear the medium, which also fit well and was easier to pull on and off. However, after wearing this dress for barely three hours the bottom half stretched out so much it was baggy and looked bad. The bottom hem remained tight on the medium dress, limiting my usually long gait. If this dress would have kept it's shape this would have been a perfect dress.","April 15, 2019","Large"

The fabric is a very stretchy, thin, cotton jersey, which allows for a dramatic versatility. I wore to two daytime events, dressed down. Because the fabric is thin, I recommend substantial undergarments.

The fabric is a flimsy ribbed jersey, but super-duper soft. No inherent structure. It's flattering, once you finally place the front knot so it lies flat without extra cutouts up top. The sleeves are crazy long and not belled exactly but a more floppy, squared-off flare. You may not believe me, but it feels totally casual. I would even try it with the right cute black low sneakers or slides to run around town doing errands. Not gala material for sure. It's new now, but neckhole was small for me.

Running true to size, I would recommend sizing up for backup since it's a more form fitting style. I would recommend Spanx and a strapless bra as undergarments for this piece. It's conservative enough for a work event, yet fun enough for a girls night out! Pair with statement heels and a bright clutch to pull the look together.","June 1, 2017","True to Size"

You can wear a regular bra with no problem. The colors maybe make it more of a “winter” dress, but note that if you are going to wear tights or spanx, they will show in the back if they come up much higher than where you would wear pants or a skirt. It’s a nice dress that I would recommend, but isn’t quite as differentiated as others I have rented, or stand out in a crowd as much (...but sometimes that’s ok), which is my reason for 4 stars rather than 5.

We ended up going to a Cirque De Soliel show in addition to getting drinks and dinner. Loved everything about this dress, it was so comfortable and fit really well. It did not cut into the lower back like I was originally worried about. I ordered a small and a medium and ended up wearing the medium. The small fit better in the top but my curvy booty and thicker thighs felt very constrained so I wore the medium instead. The extra bit of room in the top wasn't noticeable at all! The dress did stretch out throughout the night so I wondered if the small would have ended up fitting better but I was happy with the medium and wouldn't change my choice on size looking back.","January 24, 2019","Party"

I loved this dress and am so happy that I ordered it. I ordered the 48 (size 12), and the 46 (size 10) and am very glad I ordered the smaller size because the 12, which is my normal clothing size, was really large and gaped in the stomach area. Honestly, I'm dressed I usually have to jump up to a 14 because of my larger bra size, but this dress is curve friendly! This dress is a scuba-like material so it has an amazing stretch to it which makes the dress fit like a glove. I received so many compliments and I was so comfortable all night! Thank you RTR for making this stay-at-home mom feel glamorous for a night!","August 26, 2019","Wedding"

It is a well made Italian dress that appears the price it is $$$. It made me feel confident, comfortable, and classically pretty. The material is quality but also thick; it was perfect for my indoors event. I would not recommend wearing it outside on a hot summer day though. It fit me well and comfortably. I did not wear a bra but used adhesives in case I got cold. There is no zipper which was not an issue for me but I can see how it can be a challenge to slide into. I picked this dress to wear to one of the most monumental events in my life and could not have imagined wearing a better dress for me. Many complimented my dress and I was pleased with how it made me appear in photos. I loved this dress so much I considered buying it, but for now I am glad for RTR!","May 23, 2019","True to Size"

Like other dresses from this designer, there is no zipper and you kind of have to shimmy into it. Can be difficult if your hair is done. I was able to wear a bra without it showing which was good because it was freezing and the material and color show nips pretty bad.

It is more coral red than red red, if that makes sense. I am giving only 4 stars because on the size I chose to wear, the gathering on the left side had been taken out and so it just hung there. I don't think anyone noticed, but I did. It also arrived a day late so I was unable to ask for another one before my event. However I loved it and would rent again.

The dress was fitted but comfortable because of the stretchy fabric. I fluctuate between a size 2 - 6 depending on the fit and the 2 worked in this scenario. Very flattering with the ruffled fabric on the front. This dress was perfect for my company holiday party, the color was vibrant and the length was spot on. I am a tall woman (5'11"") so I'm not sure how the length works for women on the shorter side as it hit me right above the knee. Very happy with my decision!","December 7, 2018","Formal Affair"

The length of the dress was gorgeous and looked great with heels, but the fabric was completely see-through and static cling was out of control. It literally stuck to every curve in a very unflattering way. Just the fact that the dress was as see-through as it was and unlined made me return it immediately. Small bust or large bust, It couldn't have been worn without a bra because it would've been way too obscene, but even with a strapless bra you would have seen every line of your underwear and body through the dress.

Would have been great for springtime bridal/baby shower, but worked fine for work with a tank top underneath Note: the background color is definitely navy although it looks black in most photos. Pros: - Lightweight fabric that really flowed beautifully - hugs curves nicely without being form fitting - cheerful springtime pattern - great length on my 5'7"" frame hitting just below knee - wrap stayed closed 98% of the time, so not much awkward adjusting needed Cons: - ordered on my smaller side of my range (2-4) to avoid looking matronly or sack-like, but did find it snug around the ribs (I'm broad in shoulders and back) and also snug around my biceps - one good wind gust caught me in a Marilyn moment, so maybe not the best choice for outdoor events on windy days - cami was necessary as the top bloused out throughout the day - print is VERY bold and colorful, so be prepared to stand out (better for event than for work, imo)","February 5, 2019","Party"

I'm only 34B/C but bigger cups could have issue with coverage without a cami...arms were slightly tight on forearm... wasn't much an issue for me but depends on your build.

I'm pretty sure I could have sized up to the 38R and the fit would have remained the same and the arms would have been comfortable.

The slip under is super short so size up (or 2) for your 2nd option and wear the slip from that. I have a big bust and the top fit just snuggly enough, but I'd recommend an unlined nude bra.

While I highly recommend this dress, you should note that the slip is EXTREMELY tight and short- I felt like I was pulling it down all afternoon.

I'm a size 6 and it was a kind of noticeable size too big on me but due to a dress mix-up I had to pick something out at the very last minute and this dress is beautiful and was close enough. However - be aware that the slip dress underneath is very short and I found it very difficult to pull down again upon standing after it would get hiked up from sitting. Very awkward! So I was self-conscious all evening that I was flashing a lot more of myself than I had intended. (The slip dress also felt a bit tight, especially considering the lace dress was overall too loose.) For that reason alone I wouldn't rent this dress again for an upcoming event. Otherwise I think it's just beautiful. Very different and I felt like I stood out but wasn't garish. Just wish that under dress was a few inches longer!","February 1, 2017","Party"

I love to dance at weddings so this dress would not have been the better choice for obvious reasons - LOL! I would highly recommend safety pinning the front as other ladies have suggested in their reviews. I tried that out of curiosity and it definitely helped! I think this dress would be perfect for an occasion not involving dancing or moving around a lot. Overall though, it fit perfectly (size 0) and it was super flattering on!","March 4, 2019","Wedding"

Very comfortable, and the ruffles are definitely forgiving! I did have to pin the top considerably (and still was rather low cut in pictures - but personal preference, I just don't like that look on me), and the wrap opens right in the center so can show a little more leg than you'd like. I used fashion tape to try to hold it together but next time would probably pin it, as the tape didn't hold throughout the night. Standing is totally fine, as was sitting at dinner because I could use my napkin, but I wouldn't recommend this for an event if you're going to be sitting a lot!

Although it ""fit"" perfectly, in that it zipped up nicely and was snug around my waist and ribs, the front has a slit directly upwards, so it took about 5 safety pins to pin it so that it wouldn't open directly over my undies (these safety pins were actually already on the dress when it arrived, so clearly other people have had this problem, too). I also had to pin the front to keep from exposing my chest (you can't wear a bra with this one), and then used a few pieces of body tape to keep the shoulder strap from slipping off.

Perfect for women with wide hips or slim and slender girls","I absolutely love this dress and I may end up purchasing it!! I am a regular size 14 with a 38DD chest so very rarely can I fit a size 12. With this dress I fit the size 12 which was amazing. The dress is extremely cute but please note that the top front and back half of the dress are very low cut so you may need to wear fashion tape to hid a larger or smaller chest. For me, the top part was large so fashion tape is a must and I would say if your chest is any bigger than 38DD you may not be able to fit in the top. You will not be able to wear a bra due to the low back but fashion tape and nipple covers should work. The waist was snug but comfortable and I was able to wear spanx and they did not show!! The waist of the dress may be snug but the bottom half is very light and not restrictive at all which is great because I have a large butt (45 inches) and smaller waist.

It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a strapless bra since the dress is off the shoulder. At 5'0"", the length hit floor length on me. This dress is super cute but the spaghetti straps are pretty loose but you can adjust them or just tuck them in.

The biggest problem with this dress is that the armpit holes are unusually large and you can see your bra on both sides. I was able to secure one side with safety pins to hide my bra - but it didn't work on the second side. I used some fashion tape to try to conceal my bra - but found I was uncomfortable during my event trying to keep my bra undercover. Perhaps sizing down would help with this dilemma. Otherwise - beautiful dress and quality.","June 17, 2018","Party"

Classic in the black with elegant frills along the deep collar. As a large chested woman I was nervous the neckline would be too low but the frills helped take away from that and was actually very comfortable. The fabric has some stretch to it so it didn't feel suffocating being all one piece. The only problem I had was the pant length was an odd length for my size. The pants looked more like high-waters then the gorgeous outfit it was. If they had been longer or even a couple inches shorter they would have looked great with heals. I'm 5'4 for reference. Otherwise beautiful outfit, comfortable material, easy to zip up (alone if you don't have help), and terrific neckline that doesn't require a necklace with the frills adding extra flare.

That's not a bad thing, just more than I had anticipated. I paired it with a halter bra to get around the strip of open back that connects the cold shoulders. which worked great. Overall, this sweater looked good, but with the turtleneck and almost cape like sleeves, I started to feel very Dracula, and had fun with that accordingly. The fabric is heavy and does pull down/bunches so it isn't super forgiving. Sleeves didn't get in the way too much, and honestly they were the reason I rented it, and my favorite part of the sweater.

The arm straps were snug and really never moved out of place, but do limit arm movement somewhat. They do not go straight across the bicep area, but the fabric lays flat when they are kinda half off the shoulder. My only issue with this dress is it pulls on/off over your head.

While it's nice, I wouldn't recommend this dress if you're looking for wow factor.","October 14, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TT192","Tracy","Perfect Black dress","Perfect dress for a bridesmaid or any other formal event. There is no zipper so you just slip it over your head and there is enough stretch in the fabric for it to be comfortable to do so I could have gone with the 8R or 10R but I went with the 10R as it was looser in the arms and not as tight thru the rib cage which made it easier for dancing I would have kept it if I could have, it was so comfortable and I got so many compliments","October 4, 2018","Wedding"

The top fits right with stretch, but if you are insecure about your arms or the fabric possibility cutting you off at the arms, then this may not be your dress. I normally wear a 6 for my hips/butt, but I was able to wear the 4 due to fit. Thank heavens for a back up size!

Hervé léger has the best dress material (like built in spanx). This dress ran big, I wore a M definitely could have used a size S (the dress would have hugged me better and given me more shape). The top was very low cut so I could not wear a bra with the dress because the bra would show. Also, the dress was longer then other Hervé Léger dresses I have worn in the past.

I don't have any undergarments on with it here but could wear a bra if I wanted too. It's lower cut but snug in the chest so my 34DD's didn't feel like they were falling out. It's flared just a bit in the skirt so it moves well with you when you walk. Typically I would have gotten a small but it wasn't available so I opted for the medium and it was great.

This dress really lifts & accentuates the 'girls' up top. It was perfect for a Monaco F1 party, but I probably wouldn't choose it for a conservative event if you have large breasts. I thought I'd be a Medium (typically I'm a 6-8), but chose Small... I ordered both, but the Small was much more flattering on me. Whatever size you think you'd be, pick the smaller size for your back-up to compare. I hate when the entire dress is a tight bandage from top to bottom (it makes my butt look a mile long), but this has the perfect amount of 'fit and flare' to avoid that butt-hugging look... it was very flattering!","August 13, 2017","True to Size"

Ultimately I don't think it was the best for my body type; even though the material was heavy, it clung to my body very tightly and showed off every nook and cranny in my midsection, which is my problem spot.

It looked nice but the straps were falling down from time to time and the dress stretched out where I was constantly picking up and making sure everything was covered.

It's a beautiful fit in the chest and bodice but I'd recommend it for women 5'3 and up, as I can imagine the skirt being a bit too full for someone shorter. It's also not a mini dress -- hit me about an inch or two above the knee. So fun to dance it and ELEGANT despite being bodycon. Highly recommend for women 5'5 and up :)","May 4, 2017","Party"

I wore the S, though I could have worn the XS, I wanted more coverage in the chest (the girls were on display plenty in the S!) and to feel more comfortable. Classic Herve fit... like wearing built-in Spanx. I am curvy with a small waist, so having a dress that fits in the chest, waist and hips, accentuating my curves, is priceless. Color was fantastic in a sea of black dresses. The hubs gave it a big ""WOW!"" and I got compliments all night. Tip: Dont hang Herve's by the straps. Fold it and put it on the hanger like pants. Prevents stretching. I would own a closet full of Herve if I could, so I'm grateful for RTR. Already reserved the blue cage dress for my anniversary!","October 23, 2016","Party"

I'm very petite (5 ' 1"") but have a butt and thicker thighs as well as a 34C bust so tiny clothing items that contain shorts or have to zip in the back of my torso will often be too short and not zip up all the way on me, so I never know if a 0 will end up being way too small, way too big, or perfect, and I'm even more weary that a size 2 will be huge on me. After reading every single review I finally decided that a 0 would be perfect but a 2 would still likely be okay- only a size 2 was available for when I needed it and I'm so happy for that because it fit absolutely perfectly in every way possible. The bright blue color is unique and fun and the cut outs and fit make it sexy, so it's a perfect combo of fun and sexy that I wish I could own :) This pic was from the very end of the night after many hours of dancing and spilling drinks so it doesn't look like it fits as well as it truly did. I didn't wear a bra but had on silicone nipple stickies and felt totally covered and secure!","August 11, 2018","Party"

As others have noted, the midsection did slouch a bit in the front and back (but not too much) and you couldn't tell in pictures. The fabric is stretchy so it moves with you--it's not restrictive-- and the color is so gorgeous! I wish I could have kept this one!","July 17, 2018","True to Size"

The 8 was tight in the back area but I have a wide back but it fit in all of the other areas and the 10 was big in the crotch area and I had a slight gap in the back above the tailbone which is due to my short torso. I didn't want to feel uncomfortable so I wore the 10 so I would be comfortable. I wore this to a bachelorette celebration. This was my first time trying to wear a romper.

However, if you have somewhat of a short torso like I do, it may not be the best choice for you. The zippered part really bunched up in the lower back area instead of laying flat. The larger size 12 did the exact same thing plus was too big so I wore the size 10. I used fashion tape as a work-around to keep the back panel as flat and flush to my skin as possible. I got tons of compliments anyway! All things considered, it was a decent rental. This romper will require assistance to zip it up and down. I had to limit my alcohol consumption so I wouldn't need to visit the ladies' room often because it was such a hassle.","September 18, 2016","True to Size"

I had originally rented the large and it fit like a glove but it was a little to fitted through the hips and thighs which made the dress a bit short and lead to some slight bagging in the top portion around the waist. The XL was more comfortable for me and a little more event appropriate, however the top fit better for me in the large (arms,neckline).

Easy to wear for several hours and to sit down in. May be short for average height or tall person, as I am on the shorter side and the length fit just right.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP32","Melaina","Bridal Shower Mishap","I rented this even after reading the reviews and seeing photos of the fit. The main issue I have with this dress is how it fits right beneath the bust. It folds up really weird and you can't fix it because it happens each time you move. The only way I got rid of it was when I stood straight as a stick and puffed my chest out, which isn't practical obviously. I tried the XS and it was very short. The S was the best I could do because I was traveling and didn't have time to get another dress. I wouldn't recommend this dress if you're worried about people looking at nonexistent rolls/pushes that this dress creates. The dress would look different under the bust each time I took a picture. Sometimes it'd only be one fold and others it'd be an asymmetrical single or double fold. It was super weird and unpleasant to know that the slip was doing its own thing with each move I made. Otherwise it was cute, but not worth the bad pictures! The lace was really thick, which didn't bother me too much, but it was a bit unexpected how thick it was compared to the thin slip under it.","August 27, 2018","Other"

The blue color is much more vivid in person than in photos. It fit true to size and was comfortable to wear. I did wear a strapless black bra with the dress. Needed help with the zipper as it is a hidden type and difficult to zip with the lace fabric. I had planned to wear black heels but decided nude shoes looked better with this dress on me. It may be due to the longer length on me (I'm 5'6"") but the black shoes seemed to draw the eye to my feet. Because the lace is so intricate, I decided it only needed earrings to complete the look. I was totally pleased with this dress and would rent it again!","August 11, 2019","True to Size"

Neither ""runs small"" or ""runs large"" are accurate...it was tight at my bust and underbust, fit in the waist and was HUGE in the hips. The fabric is stiff, so the hips stuck out and made me look bigger than I am. This will only work if you have small breasts and are hippy.

I'm going to wear it next week with gold jewelry and a cashmere shrug for an evening party. This dress is super-fun. Everyone gave me compliments and I felt so great. It's perfect for my pear shaped body because its very tailored up top but then gets bigger below and doesn't cling. The fabric is very lightweight and almost papery... it's strange but great!

I've worn it twice since having it and plan to wear it a few more before sending it back. The fit is perfect. The length is really fun. It matches with a ton of different things so you can easily dress it up or dress it down depending on your event. I do think it runs large. I typically wear a 12, sometimes even a 14 in designer brands. I easily fit into the 10 in this and it wasn't tight at all. It does have a slightly odd material but I think it looks great.","November 5, 2017","Large"

That being said, it's true to size with the exception of the breast area. There's really not much room in there if you have a large bust. If you like your clothing tight then go a size down (that is, if you have small to medium breasts). Otherwise, stick with your size or go a size up if you have PLENTY of boobies. I styled it with an ornate, multicolor necklace and a dainty ear cuff (my own).","October 5, 2017","True to Size"

I'm not usually a fan of a handkerchief hemline but this dress was a stunner. Fit: true to size, not super fitted but body-hugging in a relaxed way as the fabric does not have stretch. Great for work and more conservative functions as it is flattering in the bust but offers fills coverage (at the arm holes included) and it is really quite short in the front (I liked how it showed off my legs) but because of the drape of the skirt in the sides/back and overall volume it doesn't feel skimpy. Fabric is very light and smooth, almost crinkly but it doesn't wrinkle, very comfortable and good for warm weather. Could be worn with tights to downplay the shorter length in the front or to transition seasons.","September 18, 2017","Everyday"

The dress is a bit on the short side, so I would say that if you are taller than 5'5"" it is probably not going to be office appropriate.

The center-front of the skirt was really straight and hit at an unflattering place on my leg. All the folds were off to the side. There were curves in the body of the dress that seemed to bow out in odd places. Maybe a smaller size would have been better but it also seemed like the zipper would not be low enough to pull on if you went smaller.","November 6, 2018","Large"

I bought this for brunch after a friend's wedding, but returned it in hopes of getting something new in time. On top of the weird fabric, it was pretty big. The cut of the hem of the skirt is very weird. No elegant draping, but I guess it would have to be that way considering the fabric.","October 24, 2018","Large"

A couple other funky things - I had to pin the lining up because it was longer than the skirt in two places (weird) and the frills on the shoulders are sewn in two different directions (so one side wants to lie flat one direction and the other, the other way). I had the dry cleaners press these so they stuck straight up, which they more or less did (the whole dress needed pressing because it's a heavy cotton and the hem of the skirt arrived pressed inconsistently) HOWEVER, all that aside, it was an amazing dress for Derby and super fun to wear!","May 10, 2019","True to Size"

I really liked the structure of the waist and the way the skirt puffed out without using any boning. And there were pockets! The material itself was much lighter than I thought it would be. Typically dresses like this are a heavy satin or polyester and this one felt like cotton. The one drawback was the shoulders. It's a bit off the shoulder but there are no straps to hook your bra into. Standing up, it was fine, but when I sat down, the straps slipped off my shoulders some and there was gaping at the front. If you've got a shorter torso or you're petite, I'd recommend using fashion tape to stick the dress to your bra strap and the top of your bra cups when you sit.","August 20, 2018","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CS70","Daisy","Beautiful dress","This is a review of the Christian Soriano white floral full skirt dress. Pros- this dress is beautiful. It has super deep pockets. I carried my 📱 in one pocket and a water bottle in the other. I wore this in New Orleans and while I did sweat, it held up pretty well. I would absolutely wear this dress again. Con- i had to safety pin the cleavage area as it just left my boobs very exposed. This is the type of dress you wear to church and well it’s too much boob. I’m a 36c. In conclusion- yes! I wore this dress to brunch and you know what, this dress elevates life.","July 12, 2018","Vacation"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CS70","Yuh-line","Cocktail dress for a small wedding","Beautiful shape and silhouette. True to size. No stretch. Have no suggestions of sizing up or down since either way doesn't work. The top is for bigger chested ladies, and the waist has to fit well. Or the dress doesn't look right. Had to use about a half a deck of fashion tape to keep the dress in place. The dress is supposed to sit right on the shoulders, which is fine, if you never move. But if you are the type of human that moves like I am, I suggest a lot of fashion tape. The lining is silky and moves, it is a comfortable and beautiful and noteworthy dress. Endless compliments and fun to spin in on the dance floor. I wore mine with red pumps.","May 19, 2018",""
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CS70","RTR Customer","Thank you, Christian Siriano, for making designer apparel accessible to all!","I LOVED this dress. But, in hindsight, it was probably a bit busty for my event. The dress does run small - though I would more typically wear an 18W in a fit/flare style dress such as this, the 22W fit comfortably albeit perhaps a bit large - but I feel like that is to be expected with higher end designers. Not sure that fashion tape would have helped, the ""straps"" (as they were) were a bit wide for my shoulders. Again, probably because the dress was too big, but the next size down wasn't available. So ... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","May 17, 2018","Large"

I'm about 140 lbs, 5'6.5"", 36B with wide shoulders and hips. The size 6 felt a bit too big in the waist/hips but was super tight at the banded top, which ultimately made it hang strangely in a way I found unflattering.

This was a great dress and very comfortable for the event. You can wear straps with it but it does make the top part roll down and looks great as a strapless.

The fabric is comfortable and swingy and the strapless stayed up really easily! As other reviews have mentioned, the built in ruffle/cape adds some interest and fluidity so it's not like you are just wearing a sheath, which is great for someone like me who is always trying to hide her belly. The weird thing is the ruffle/cape doesn't totally cover your belly, but is kind of to the side. I wasn't sure I was wearing it right, but I think you could kind of rotate it to make sure it worked for you. I ended up wearing it with a wrap to dress it up and it was super comfy and easy to wear.","January 24, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RZ60","Samantha","Stylist Review","The perfect but different LBD for your next night out! First of all, the fit is true to size and is so flattering for all body types. The structured shoulders definitely gave me the hourglass shape that I wish I had, but the ruffles don't make your shoulders look extra wide. It is fitted at the waist to make sure to size up for backup if you like a looser fit in the midsection but there is ample room in the hips. I would recommend this for women with A to C cups since the material does stick to your body due to the stretch. It's a hassle-free dress since it can be worn with a standard bra. At 5'6, this comes up to mid thigh for me! Pair this with your favorite pair of strappy heels and maybe some red tassel earrings!","August 21, 2017","True to Size"

The reviews said it runs small, I agree, it fit well in the chest, but was tight in the hips. I could have sized up, but it would have been too big.

I didn't wear a bra as the material is thick but I did wear nipple concealers, just in case. I didn't wear Spanx although I wish that I had so my tummy would have been flatter.

I don't have an hourglass figure, so I'm sure that plays into how it fit, but it was a bit tight in the chest, otherwise I would have worn a 10.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JS85","Heather","Classy yet sexy.","For reference, I'm 5'1, 145 lbs, and typically a size 8-10. In higher end clothing I vary between an 8 and a 12 depending on the brand. So I think this dress ran true to size. The 10 fit great but it came damaged. The cape was torn where it met the shoulder of the dress. Rather than pay $25 to overnight another 10 I decided to go with the 12. It was fine. Notes: This dress is short. I'm pretty short and when I sat down I was very glad I wore tights with this dress and didn't go bare-legged as originally planned (thanks Florida for throwing us cold weather during Spring Break). It definitely crept up higher than mid thigh when I was sitting so if you prefer a more modest length skirt definitely pair this with tights or stockings. Speaking of, make sure if you DO wear some (because the skirt creeps up when you sit) try sitting down in your tights/hose before you go anywhere. If they have any reinforcement in the thigh area it may show when you sit. Because the weather turned out to be chillier than planned my choice of undergarments were my Spanx opaque tights. They're warm. Unfortunately they're also reinforced in the upper thigh. I had to yank them up higher to make sure that part didn't show. Be careful if you are a slip wearer. I am, and I couldn't wear one with this dress because it showed (even my short one). The lining tended to peek out when I sat down and I had to keep an eye on that. The straps to keep it on the hanger weren't too bad. I had my husband stick the back one down the back of my bra and it didn't come out all night. The front one got the same treatment and it kept trying to peek out but I kept it hidden. Tape would've helped. This dress has no give. If you're hippy definitely sit down for a bit before you choose which size you're going to wear. The 10 would've worked but I think I was more comfortable in the 12. We were at the bar before the ceremony and I was very glad of the little extra room in the hips while swinging up and down from a barstool. And getting in and out of the truck. This dress is definitely a show stopper. I received many compliments on it. My husband called it classy but sexy. But he wouldn't let me wear boots with it - he said it reminded him too much of Batgirl.","March 18, 2017","Wedding"

Also thought it would be fuller, but the tulle on the underskirt was totally limp. That said, I got compliments on the gown throughout the night. And I loved having pockets!

The dress reflected beautifully under the event lighting. I've never felt so beautiful. All evening, strangers were coming up and complimenting me over the dress. It fit just right. You will need help with zipping it up. I wore the long version with high heels. Would not recommend the Long for anyone shorter than 5'5. All in all, I will definitely rent this again.

It was slightly tight in the ribcage but I could still comfortably sit, eat, and move around. I wore it to a black tie holiday party for my husband's work and people loved it! In the dark lighting the dress really sparkled. The zipper is very difficult to do the first couple of times- I had to have help. I wore flats though could have worn a bit of a heel. I also wore leggings under to stay warm! Comfortable and felt beautiful! I also tried on the size 8 but it was too large and felt like it might fall down.","January 17, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AID9","RTR Customer","Fabulous, Unique Dress for Black Tie Wedding","I absolutely LOVED this dress! Based on other reviewers, I initially ordered my regular size and a size up. However, my chest and waist are significantly smaller than my bottom half, so both sizes were too big! Fortunately, they had the 8L in stock and it fit so much better. I'm 5'8"" and wore 3.5 inch heels, and it was still a smidge long, so take that into consideration when ordering. The print is so unique; love the color combo. I received so many compliments, even from people who weren't guests at the wedding! My only true gripe was the strings to keep the dress on the hangar (not sure what those are called?) kept popping out of the dress. Aside from that, I highly recommend renting this gorgeous gown if you want to stand out in a crowd!","January 9, 2019","Wedding"

I used hem tape of course, since I'm very petite. I felt it was a tiny bit loose at the bust and was afraid I would be yanking it up all night, but it worked out. I don't think I'd be able to let loose on the dance floor though. I loved the shimmery gold. I wore a strapless bra. I wore black pumps. Brown or navy would've matched better, but no one could see them anyway. I also wore a brown shawl with it but I think a shimmery gold shawl would've been nicer. I was very happy with this dress!","December 17, 2018","True to Size"

I'm really not top heavy, but I wanted to make sure the dress would zip up, so I requested both sizes. The size 8 was too tight and I was unable to zip it, but the 10 fit perfect. I'm 5'4"" so the dress brushed the floor a little bit, but I had on 3"" heels. I did not want to carry around a clutch, so I truly appreciated the pockets! I received so many compliments. The material was thick and had the right amount of weight. It was PERFECT! This dress is absolutely gorgeous. I was different and this dress made me stand out.

For all the 5'1"" shorties with no boobs, thick thighs, butt-is-your-best-asset, Crossfitter-type bodies, this gown in petite is freakin' PERFECTION. GET IT. I am not a fan of high heels and my 3"" worked fabulous with it. No stretch, and I wore a Stickeebra with no underwear for the cutouts.

There will still be a slight train in the back as the dress is made for that. The dress feels like silk and the panels are sewn in a diagonal. It feels like butter on your body or the most comfortable silk pajamas ever. I cannot recommend enough it is stunning! II wore a nubra and you can get away with very tiny undies if you want.

The only issue I had was getting the back hook closed. I struggled for like 5 minutes with that to get the dress on but otherwise it was perfect. The cutouts and different shades of red were a perfect combo.

You are not able to wear a standard bra with this, so you should wear a strapless bra since the back is open. At 5'4 , the length hit tea length on me. Intricate crochet lace from Estepona, Spain tiers swath this lovely sheath dress further accented with a pop-over overlay and peekaboo trumpet hem.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSC11","RTR Customer","Fashion over function","I can definitely say the quality of this dress was on point. It was delivered a day early and had limited wrinkles upon arrival. The material was very high quality, but the zipper and padding in the front of the dress were kind of a disaster. That being said , the overall experience was not the best. I order sizes 14 and 16. The 14 was very small and oddly (and thankfully) the 16 was the true to size option I went with. The dress fit very well in the arms and the length was good even with heels. I received many compliments, but it was very uncomfortable to sit in this dress. I would discourage anyone who is attending an event with a sit down dinner etc to go with another option because the rib cage area is very restrictive. Additionally, the dress has built in cups which created a weird line on the front across my bust. My friend helped me maneuver them as best we could, but I was still self conscious about it for photos.","March 26, 2019","Formal Affair"

I'm 5'3, wore 4"" heels and the dress still had an extra 1/2 inch on the ground. My only complaint is the built in bra padding. I couldn't wear a bra with it because that made the liners even more obvious and the pads weren't even close to covering my boobs (34DDD) so there was a weird line across my boobs, and I was left pulling my boobs up all night because it wasn't tight enough to hold them in place. Otherwise, great fit.","February 28, 2019","Formal Affair"

After scouring RTR for quite some time, I chose this dress, and I am SO GLAD I did! It was beautiful! I ordered the 8R and 10L as my back-up (they didn't have an 8L available for my dates.) When the dresses arrived, I didn't even try the 8 on and went straight to the 10. I'm normally an 8, but the 10 fit like a gem and true to size. If you're on the fence, I would size up one to be safe. I'm 5'7 and in heels, the 10L just touched the floor so it was the perfect length. The dress was sexy, simple and elegant! I received so many compliments on it all night and truly felt like a princess in it!! I wish I could keep it and even started searching the internet to see if I could find a place to buy it. LOL!

Really liked it. That said, this item was not my first choice for my unlimited shipment. I got it because there was extremely little available in stock and because I learned that my first choice item did not actually exist- RTR advertises a lot of items in their inventory that they don't actually have, and not because they are rented, but because they just literally do not have those items anymore; they used to, but they don't anymore. This is false advertising and it's very frustrating. And this is not the only issue that RTR has- missed shipments, wrong items sent, extremely slow customer service response, etc. So while I gave this item 5 stars, I would give RTR's operations 2 stars.","October 8, 2018","Party"

It was comfortable and form fitting, but it tended to ride up a little bit, so I found myself pulling it down regularly. I also noticed right away it was a bit stretched out around the armpits, creating a little bit of a gap, as well as stretched out too much around the bottom of the legs. Probably brand new the bottom half wouldn't have bothered me too much, but because of it being stretched out, I didn't feel the length worked very well on my 5'4"" height.","November 4, 2018","Wedding"

Rented the Medium and the Large, wore the large but should have worn the medium. By the end of the night the dress had given a little, the medium probably would have held tighter all night. Fabric is amazing and supportive. I'm 5'4, 155lbs, 36DD. I didn't wear any spanx or a bra and I felt supported all over. The fabric is on the thick/heavy side so I wouldn't wear it if you're outside and it's hot. I feel like someone with a longer torso would fit his dress perfectly. The lace around the neck gapped a little because I have a shorter torso. Still not a deal breaker! Felt sexy and classy.","August 19, 2018","Date"

(I tend to be between an XS and a S, bc the fabric has so much stretch, I prob could have worn an XS, but it would have been more like a bodycon fit...) The neckline was a bit stretched out and hung awkwardly, so I pinned it to make it tighter.

I got the 4L bc 4R was sold out, ended up wearing the backup size 6R bc it had better room for my bust. The dress has no bust support so need to wear a good strapless bra. The torso bunches up a lot, so I would recommend something like spanx. Loved the leg slit & the color, it was a nice matte cool yellow tone, just bright enough to stand out but not distract.

Really worked with my tanned skin tone (although I really regret the bikini lines). It's not that stretchy & the 2R fit better in the body, but did not give any room for the boobs so I went with 4R.

The length on me was also good - covered my 2-3 inch heels without dragging on floor. My issue was that is runs small. The 8 was my backup size and fit tighter than I would have wanted. The top portion lacked rubber grips on the interior so I was also tugging to keep it up most the evening.","May 26, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL128","Nat","I felt like a princess and was comfortable too!","I rented this dress in regular sizes 8, 10 and 12. I ended up picking the 10. The 8 wouldn't zip up in the back and the 12 was too loose. Just to give you a little bit of size information. I typically wear a size 6 in dresses and skirts at Ann Taylor Loft. And size medium in shorts and pants at Athleta. Tops are typically extra small or small at both places. I find that gowns are usually a tad bit smaller in general. This is why I picked ""true to size"". I assume the 10 would be the perfect fit but wanted to make sure so I tried the other sizes as well. I am a little bit shorter so I grabbed 2 1/2 to 3 inch heels to wear with it. I suggest always having fabric tape to use when ordering anything from rent the runway as they are not hemmed. And fabric tape works amazingly - I did not use it on this dress however. This was comfortable and adorable and everyone loved it! Definitely a showstopper! I would definitely recommend this and would wear it again given the chance!","May 20, 2019","Formal Affair"

It is tighter with the overlay but the under was forgiving. There is a slight itchy factor to the fabric but I wanted my arms & legs covered because it was January. Loved the detail and I wore a black bodysuit underneath because the sheer panel I didn't feel was appropriate in that setting.

I am athletic build with a big ol' booty and a narrow waist and hips. Fitted dresses normally work on me and this was no different. I ordered the S/M because the L was out (reviews said size up). I couldn't even get the small on (AT ALL), medium was a good snug fit and I think L would have been too big. That said, the M was tight in the arms and a little tight in the hips, but that's mostly just my body. The arms did chafe a little bit by the end of the night, and because of the tight fit, I did ultimately want to get it off. Until then though, I felt amazing. My date told me heads were turning for this dress!! And the President of my company sought me out to tell me how much she loved it, and she wasn't the only one.

I'd rent a size up as a back up if you're pregnant. I was 29 weeks pregnant in the photo. The waist is elastic, and there's plenty of room with the tie belt.

The slit was a perfect balance to the sweetness of the flounciness of the dress, though you can see that I didn't wear the off-shoulder sleeve parts for the workday (just felt a bit too party-ish, but I did wear it normally for my evening events!). My only complaint was the underskirt--which I've pictured here. The fabric was bunchy and I had to keep tugging it down since it's not secured to the skirt with stitching. I was glad to have shorts to wear under it, otherwise I would have been really unhappy.","August 2, 2018","Everyday"

I'm very glad I did! This fit well though for my shape (pear) it was still pretty roomy in the bust area and the lining bunched up a lot in the back. For a rayon/poly dress this looks and photographs more luxe. Sash is not completely removable - it's stitched in place in the back - so that limits some styling options. Overall really liked it and can't wait to rent more from this brand. As others have said, it's quite long so great for taller people. I'm 5' 8"" and wore with about 2.5 inch heels which was the ideal end length for me.","June 25, 2018","Party"

Running true to size with some stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back-up. This style is formfitting throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are able to wear a standard bra with this maxi. At 5'4, the length hit floor length on me. Styled with cold shoulders, airy ruffles and a tie waist, it's as flattering as it is feminine. I would recommend pairing with a cute bracelet and small earrings to complete this look.","June 15, 2018","True to Size"

I was a little worried about it being too long (I'm 5'3'') but with a 3 inch heel it was perfect--probably an inch above the floor, just enough to show some shoe. I put on sneakers for dancing and it was touching the floor a bit but not enough that I was tripping. I wore it at the beginning with a sticky strapless bra (NuBra) which I took off and replace with BandAid blister cushions for my nipples. Really--this is the best tip!!

Definitely would want to rent this dress again!! For reference, I wore the size 10 and I'm about 5'6"", 34DD (31 in waist and 42 in hips--I find this more helpful with sizing personally).

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS73","Kimberly","Sleek LBD","I was super excited (& somewhat nervous) to rent this piece after reading through the many reviews regarding fit and sizing. I am a slender build and typically wear a 4 (or at most a 6) in dresses. Still, I carefully considered reviews that suggested going two sizes up and so, I hesitantly ordered a size 10 (as there wasn’t an 8 available). Praise be for the smaller size not being an option, because the rental would have been a complete fail. The size 10 was *quite* form fitting; owing to the restrictive nature of the sleeves, I dare say a 12 may have even been ideal. That stated, I wouldn’t suggest wearing this piece for any event that requires a lot of arm movement or perhaps even leg movement (given that it’s a pencil skirt fit). Though, it’s perfect for a ‘stand still and be seen’ type of outing - and it’s gorgeous :)","June 14, 2019","Small"

However, dancing, going to the bathroom (bring someone with you to unzip!) and overall just moving around is hard to do. I really needed a 10 but the 8 worked. I'm normally a 6. In hindsight this is more of like, a gala dress or something that doesn't involve dancing. The dress did stay up which is hard to find with a strapless dress.

I rent clothes from another service and never have issues. I am 5'7"" and 155 lbs with an athletic build. I generally wear a size 6, but even the 12 was tight in my arms and chest. While I am athletic, I've never had anything so tight on my arms and chest but lose through my waist and hips. The size 10 fit much better through the hips and waist but there's no way I could have zipped it. Even the 12 required help zipping and I couldn't wait to take it off as my ribs felt like they were slowly being crushed. If your curvier I'm really not sure how you would use the restroom in this. I could luckily pull it up since it was lose in the hips but I can't imagine curvier ladies having that ability. Overall: don't plan on being remotely comfortable, size up, and not for an event where you need lots of motion. So cute but not functional.","December 18, 2018","Other"

Some helpful tips are to get this dress a couple of sizes up or to go to the website for this designer and use their measurements to determine your size.

I have an hourglass figure so I'm already curvy, that mixed with the baby bump made this dress quite fitting! I am typically a size 4, I wore a size 8 because that was the only other size available, I think a 10 would've been perfect (and much more comfortable). Also, if you're busty you may want to be a little careful with this one, my pregnancy boobs are at a DD right now and at times I felt like I was going to tumble out of the top.

If you are curvy be prepared for some major cleavage. But I still thought it was super classy dress. Loved my first rental!","October 25, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS73","Halley","This dress is GREATfor your figure. But she is tight, would totally rent again","The tightest region is the bust/where the zipper ends because the sleeves in the fabric don’t give. Take these ladies seriously about sizing up, im usually a 0-2 and I squeezed in the 4. Only downfall is feeling like you have t-Rex arms all night. But I would say the fit is worth it. Material isn’t too thick, but thick enough you don’t need shaper under it.","October 17, 2018","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS73","RTR Customer","The compliments I received where good for the ego :)","There are no words in the dictionary to describe how fantastic this dress was. Based on the reviews I ordered a size 4, initally it was too small. I removed my bra, and it fit perfectly. It hugs your hips, so it was a bit restricting when trying to dance. I am on a hunt to find this dress so that I can purchase it!","October 14, 2018","Small"

It really has that old Hollywood feel to it. The only reason I gave four stars was that it was quite small. I read the reviews and got two sizes up. And thank goodness I did! I ALWAYS need a bra, and I didn't even need one it was so form fitting. Which was nice because it def gave the sex appeal but when it came to dancing it was a little difficult. I couldn't really even get a full stride in when I walked lol. BUT I am a slave for fashion and I have to say that it was a worth it sacrifice for how great I felt in it!","October 8, 2018","Wedding"

I usually wear a 4 and originally ordered a 4 but exchanged for a 2 which was more flattering yet still forgiving in the ribcage and hip area because of the shape/style. Great for post partum bods. Worked well with a sweater blazer and a wool wrap on a different occasion. Fabric is somewhat structured, has a little weight due to the type of fabric, layers and lining.","August 29, 2019","Vacation"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HB95","Darlene","Beautiful quality. I could have sized down.","Love the quality of the fabric and flowy style. Got it in my usual size 2 and it is works with a strapless bra but barely. I'm small chested (32B), small rib cage, straps aren't adjustable and the front is low cut. Those things combined make the top a little big. This could be fixed by wearing a plunge bra or bralette. If you're larger up top then you're fine. Since the bottom is so flowy a size 0 would have worked for me as well, probably better. At 5'3"" it hits a little above the ankle. The only other cons are that it hurts to lean against the top of the back zipper/clasp and I needed help clasping the top piece. I do like how the skirt is lined. On a warm nyc day it didn't add too much heat but does give the dress nice structure and it's also a nice feature for the freezing indoor AC temps","July 11, 2019","Everyday"

The neck was a bit tight, the armholes were a bit large, and the waist was a bit large like other renters have said, but it wasn't uncomfortable for me. I wore it without a bra and that was fine. I wore it for about 6 hours for a wedding and was comfortable.

I ordered one size down like the other reviewers suggested, but I found it was true to size on me. The XS would've worked, but I went with the S because the neck hole was bigger. I wore it without a bra and even though it was a religious wedding, I didn't feel like I was too exposed. It photographed beautifully from some angles but looked a little unflattering from others due to all the fabric on the bottom. But I also felt like all the fabric balanced me out since I have broad shoulders and a large ribcage. It's a little darker in person than it looks in the pictures and the underlay is orange, not white. My only issue with this dress was the neckline. It was a little itchy and tight at first, but as the night went on I was able to tune it out. Overall a great dress that I got many compliments on!","October 21, 2018","True to Size"

I didn't mind the low armholes, but I also didn't wear a bra, so I wasn't concerned about straps or sides showing. I'm also pretty broad around the chest and ribs (38"" pre-pregnancy) so there were no gaps. I was worried this would feel too big since it has draping to accentuate the rear, but by styling with some tall wedges, it really helped me feel more proportional. I had strangers in the street complimenting me on this one. Loved it!","October 9, 2018","True to Size"

The lace was breathable and not too heavy for the amount of fabric. I got compliments all night long, I would have rented the small - but it was unavailable. The medium was more like a large and definitely hung loosely around my armpit area showing off a bit of my side boob/bra.

It definitely caught the attention of other wedding guests and I got a lot of compliments! It is a nice burnt orange/copper color. I was concerned with looking too much like a pumpkin for this October wedding but it didn't have that vibe. The midi length was so classy--I'm 5'11"" and it really hit just at the knee for me, but that was fine. The lining under the lace was long enough to be comfortable. The skirt is wayyyy bigger than it appears, so it was so fun to spin in on the dance floor! I was concerned about side boob--I am usually a size 6 and the medium was the only size available for my weekend. I definitely could have sized down to a small because the dress is not very fitted. However, the sides were not overly revealing. I wore an adhesive bra and nothing showed. Highly recommend this for your fall and winter weddings!","October 8, 2018","Large"

Based on reviews, I sized down and still had plenty of room. If I didn't have a larger chest, I probably would have wanted to go down two sizes to provide more shape in the waist. This was the only full body picture I got so it unfortunately doesn't show, but the waist is not form fitting, so if you prefer a dress with more shape that is something to consider. I thought about wearing a belt to cinch at the waist, but it is so beautiful on its own I went without. Perfect dress for a fall wedding!","October 3, 2018","Wedding"

The only downside, the neck was a little tight at first, but I eventually got used to it, if you are not a fan of things around your neck tightly, I'd stay away, but otherwise the dress is great.

Belt was a necessity because of both the oversizing and the cut of the dress. I also pinned both sides under the armpits a little bit. The armpits also run longer than I would have liked.

Like previous reviews stated, it does run a tad large. I typically wear a Medium or Size 8 and was able to comfortably wear a size Small. It is a bit roomy in the waist, so I belted it with a brown ribbon to really cinch the waste. It looked great with or without, but I wanted it more form fitting for the evening.

I loved that the skirt was full but the top form fitting. The lace was feminine and boho but still youthful, sophisticated and appropriate for this event. The dress ran large so I wore a medium without a bra it fit perfectly (the large fit with a bra but was too loose around the waist and ribcage ). Wish I had a black leather jacket to wear with it but a black Gail eres suit jacket worked well and I liked it with strappy black heels.","November 5, 2017","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FP12","Laura","Casual Fall Wedding","The dress was very comfortable. The color was beautiful, especially for a fall event. The sizing was true to my bodice. I tend to be a 6 on top and an 8 across my bottom. This dress truly accommodates that kind of figure. It is not cut to cling. There was plenty of bodice room. As other reviews have noted the top and armhole area are cut in. I did need to wear an appropriate bra color because it does peek out. I am sure, if I were 20 years younger, a strapless bra would have been best. I enjoyed wearing this dress! The dress did arrive a day late. RTR staff acknowledged my concern kindly and efficiently. Thank you","October 17, 2017","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FP12","Kelsey","Great for Fall wedding","I loved the color of the dress and how perfect it was for a Fall wedding. It's more of a burnt orange than a copper, per say, but it got plenty of compliments (especially in pictures from the event). This dress also TWIRLED; dancing at the reception was so much fun with this number! I'm also glad I got the Medium rather than the Large, following advice from other reviews (I'm normally a dress size 10). However, as others have mentioned, the fit is a little complicated. The neckline was very high, and the arm holes are very large and low. Since I'm a little bigger on the top, I wore a strapless bra, but I had to wear a sweater or remember to keep my arms down so it wouldn't show on the sides. I found myself trying to adjust where the dress fell on me all night, and I learned that I don't prefer a high neckline, as it was a little restricting for me, personally. Although it photographed well, I feel like the fit wasn't as ideal as other dresses I've rented. Overall, I liked it, but I didn't love it.","October 17, 2017","Large"

As other reviews have mentioned, this dress does run tight in the waist and hips. I'm normally a size 4, and ended up wearing the size 6. I didn't wear the loose sleeve on the side and no one noticed, but it did add an extra ruffle look on one side. The neckline is very deep so I used fashion tape and a safety pin to make it more modest. The length in the back was a little long for my height (5ft2in with 3in heels), so I had to hold it in certain situations so it wouldn't drag behind me. In the end, this dress was comfortable to wear and hugged all the right places, it just needed some extra work to fit the top.","April 28, 2019","Wedding"

Unfortunately, it was not available, but I loved the dress so much I went ahead and got the 2R. The day of the wedding it fit much better than expected and I received SO many compliments. I agree with other reviews that the cut in the front is very low, but I was still fine with wearing a plunge V bra. If it wasn't so expensive in real life, I would buy this for other occasions!! I also didn't wear the extra arm fabric, I saw in reviews some people pinned it down, but I didn't even do that and you couldn't notice, it just added an extra ruffle layer on your side.","June 28, 2018","True to Size"

If you are slim and petite, I would size down. I wore a size 2 but could have gone with a O instead. However, if you are busty and curvy, I would size up. This dress was perfect for the party.

The dress has 0 stretch, so was super tight around my hips. Whew! Could barely pull it down all the way. Spanx helped, but still a bit uncomfy for sitting.

Size one size up and be prepared to pin the fabric around the chest. Otherwise, it was a beautiful dress. The only other thing that's hard is that the lining kept riding up and twisting, which I notice on many dresses these days.

A couple of cons: the bust is very low cut, and the one piece of fabric just sort of drapes over. So when you're moving or dancing it can be very revealing. I pinned it and that solved the problem. The lining was a bit tight on my hips and butt, and the low cut back sagged a little bit. Again, pinned it, problem solved. I am 5'6"" and wore 3"" heels, and the dress was about an inch too short.

I wore this for a wedding in Lake Tahoe. My original pick didn't fit and my back up size wasn't available and after a major complication where RTR sent more dresses for me to try but sent them to my home in NC instead of Lake Tahoe, I finally got this dress from them. I asked for the 8 because I was too afraid to try a 6 after the other one didn't fit. While this fit looser and was a bit big, I didn't mind because we were eating and drinking all night and I felt 100% comfortable in it. I loved the plunging neckline with the twist above.

The front design was really pretty and got me lots of compliments, but I did have to tape to keep the ladies from falling out when I bent over or danced around.

This dress was actually a backup to my original dress that was too small. Length was perfect for flats, which was more comfortable than heels. The area around my rib cage was tight and slightly uncomfortable all night. The opening around my bra area gapped open and I was not happy with that because I was constantly tugging at it and keeping my chest covered, however a little double sided fabric tape did help somewhat. Overall, I was pleased with the dress but would not rent again as the front area made me uncomfortable.","January 30, 2018","Formal Affair"

The 4 ended up fitting the best because it wasn't as tight around my hips and thighs. The length was PERFECT! I was so happy with the length of the dress! My only worry when wearing the dress was the crossing fabric in the front. Since I was not able to wear a bra with this gown, I was worried about leaning over, hugging people, etc because I didn't want to show too much cleavage.

The 12R fit like a dream but right under the bust there was a tear that I didn't want to attempt to hide so I opted for the 14R. I'm 5'5"" and the dress was a bit long. I wanted to wear flats (which is why I chose a long dress in the first place) and I had to hold my dress for a majority of the night but I didn't personally find it that big of a problem. The inside liner was the perfect length but the top fabric was where it got long. If I had ordered the petite size, maybe then it would have been the perfect length for wearing flats. I am not a very busty lady so the dress dipped down in the front more than I would have like. I just pinned it up and it still looked great. The back cut out is my favorite part! It's high enough where you could wear a shaper or spanx if you needed it.

It's tight around the rib cage, and makes the chest area gap open because of it. I ended up going with the larger size because of it, but was still concerned you could see a lot of side boob. The back of the dress also gaps out. It made it look like I had wings. It did not lay flat on my back, and made me a little self conscious. Length wise was pretty decent. I'm 6'1, so length is always a bit difficult. I wore about a 1 1/2 inch heel, and the dress just touched the top of my feet.","November 14, 2017","Formal Affair"

I ordered a 6 even though I'm usually a 4. The bottom part of the dress fit *perfectly* and was actually so pretty. However, the top part of the dress (sleeves and bust area) were massive. It is overloaded with so much extra material on top.

It fits small in the shoulders, short in the arms and the graduated hem is short in front, so it fits nice on a short person but might look weird on a tall one. The flounce of the hem and keyhole in the front are just enough to dress it up without making it too frumpy or too revealing for work. The high low hem was very flattering for my legs. This is one of my favorite colors for work, too. My criticism is that the material is quite thin and polyestery. It is easy to sweat through, and does not feel like an expensive dress. It needs one of those sweat-catching undershirts underneath and that kind of ruins the keyhole effect. Call me a purist but I expect more natural fibers in designer clothes.","April 10, 2019","Small"

Had this fit better I would have absolutely loved it. The slits in the legs are gorgeous and make the dress very easy to move in and the color is fantastic.

I wore a small, but it was a bit tight in the bust. The medium had too much room in the bust. The slits up the side gave this otherwise gentle dress a little sex appeal. It was an okay rental and served its purpose. I don't think I would rent this dress again.","July 3, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CMO14","Sarah","Good mix of trendy and classy","I had been wanting to rent this dress for awhile, and finally did for an evening wedding in June. I loved the thicker material and color of the dress. It definitely hugged the hips tight so I wore shapewear to smooth the lines with the small-- the medium was way too big and not a good fix. The biggest con I would say is that the top portion was a little too baggy, so I had to be aware of not slouching over and ended up pulling it up a little with a safety pin behind the neck. I wore a sticky bra that did slightly show on the sides a bit so I was also conscious about that. Not my most comfortable/favorite rental but definitely got tons of compliments and it served the job!","June 29, 2019","Small"

In the pictures the lining is buff/beige so that the lace and the beading really stand out. But the actual dress had a black liner and so the intricate details got completely lost. Such a bummer.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF6","Nicole","Love the slit on this and the way the dress falls is perfect!!","I wore this on a day trip to Montauk (NY) and I got a ton of compliments.... it can go from being dressy (which is what I originally thought it to be) to being a nice, hamptons/nautical day dress with a pair of sandals (how I wore it). I did not have to wear a bra, my chest was held in on top so you couldn't tell- huge bonus. The slit goes up pretty high on your leg so it makes up for the fact that the dress is long and loose. It was tight on my ribs a bit where it goes from the top to the skirt, but I could completely breathe and move around. (If back-fat is a concern of yours you my want to consider getting a size up as a back up just in case.) It is hard ordering clothes sometimes being petite but also having a chest, either XS are too tight on top or they are not tight enough on my waist and give me no shape - this dress was PERFECT.","September 4, 2018","Vacation"

It wasn't the best choice for a horse race...I had trouble playing corn hole and sitting down. At the end of the day I unzipped the back a little just to give me some more breathing room.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LVF6","Shandalia","Missing a button","I read the reviews thoroughly before renting, so, i took the advise and sized up...glad I did! Upon arrival, the dress looked rough. The underlining was sticking out from the dress and the slit opening was flipped out, so the lining was showing there too. The Medium I chose to wear was also missing a button. After I ironed it and ripped a button off of the one I didn't wear and attached it to the one I did....It turned out pretty good. The bottom of the dress runs small, but the top runs large. It worked because the back of the dress just bloused down, so that wasn't that big of a deal. If you size up, you can avoid the slit in the front being inappropriate. I wore this for an outdoor wedding in Vegas, so I felt like showing a little leg in sin city would be ok, but the small showed underwear (not just leg). I wore a sticky bra that had the sticky back to it and secured it to the dress rather than to my chest as I figured I'd sweat it off in 5 mins. The fabric doesn't tend to wrinkle easily, which was also a plus. I got a lot of compliments and would tell someone to rent this dress as long as they heeded the warnings listed.

I love plunging necklines but this was too much! It didn't lay flat on my chest (it was too big). I had to use fashion tape to lay the material flat on my chest and use a safety pin to tighten fabric right in between my boobs to give me more coverage while keeping the plunging neckline. Bright side, this is a comfy dress and nice material. I think if I would have bought a small then maybe it would have fit better up top and maybe singed more at my waist to flatter my body type.","August 7, 2018","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ASR19","RTR Customer","Different silhouette","I really wanted to LOVE this dress. But I could't quite get there. The fit is different. There are 2 adjustable drawstrings- one directly under bust, the other at the waist. They are tough to tighten because there is no elastic and the fabric feels very fragile. I know it's fragile because the first dress I was sent was ripped down past the second drawstring. Someone clearly didn't know how to tighten it and they pulled too hard and ripped the dress. It shouldn't have passed RTR quality control but they did overnight me the same style so it all worked out. I wore petal pasties as a bra would have shown- even one with a deep v. I don't think this would be for curvy girls or girls with a larger chest. It's a midi length so heels are best if you're short.

Since when I rented there were no reviews, I looked up the brand and their size chart and got an 8 on account of that but probably could have done a 6. It was pretty windy which made it silly to walk around sometimes in since the top part flapped up. Best for a sunny day with no wind!

I really loved this dress - got lots of compliments throughout the night. I ordered a 2L and 4L, and wore the 2L, as the dress does run a bit large. Liked the classy, elegant look - the color and the sequins were great. I am on the pale side, and decided to get a spray tan for the wedding, but the color of the dress still looked good without the tan. The dress was delivered a whole week before the wedding so I had plenty of time to try it on with shoes/ accessories, etc. The only con as other reviewers mentioned that the sequins go right to the seam, so can get a little scratchy against your skin, but definitely not anywhere close to a deal-breaker.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works best for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a strapless bra, nubra or no bra since the dress is off the shoulders. At 5""3, the length hit right at my knees on me. This dress is perfect for a night out or for date night.

The cut is super flattering, the fabric looks interesting and is comfortable to wear, and it feels like a dress that can be worn in all kinds of seasons or occasions. I wore this on date night to my husband's work holiday party in NYC. You could just as easily pair with a blazer for a work dinner, or sandals for summer night out.

The bodice was tight and the bottom really ballooned out. I could barely breath when it was zippered up, so didn't wear it.

Normally I'm between a 4 and a 6 so those are the sizes I got. I didn't even try on the 6 because when I tried on the 4 it fit fine. If anything it was a little big on top (my chest is on the smaller side) but I don't know if a 2 would have been too small. Either way I loved it and got lots of compliments on it.

Material has some heft, so worked perfectly for our TX fall weather. Best part of this dress is the hemline and drape of the skirt. It adds something nice to this simple dress. One note is that you need to wear more of a streamlined bra so it doesn't show where the arm holes are, but a normal bra works great.","November 21, 2016","Date"

I was mostly pleased when I put it on and then when I took the photo realized it looked better in natural light and with the belt (which is mine). It's a little roomy for the size in the upper bust (though not on me at the ribcage) and roomy enough that the belt made a difference in the waist. I would not, however, have wanted the size smaller because of the ribcage factor (for reference my ribcage, at all the sizes I've ever been, is wider than average).

As other reviews have noted the fabric is heavier than expected. The top of the dress runs quite large. I'm typically a 6, but will size down to a 4 in an a-line.

As other reviews noted, the color is dusty and muted yet still very pretty. I received 2 compliments on the pretty dress. Because I am 5'10, and the dress hem is asymmetrical- at the shortest part it was a bit short! I still found the dress to be conservative because of the neckline and overall loose fit.

I would say it runs a little big, but it still looked cute - it's not fitted, but still flattering, so it's good if you want a dress that can hide some flaws. The fabric is thick and beautiful, and the flower texture is really nice. The colors are close to the RTR picture, just a little more vibrant. The only thing that was surprising is that the colors of the stripes are printed on, so they bleed a little past where the flowers end - it's meant to be this way, and it looks fine, but I just didn't expect it. The only reason I have this 4 stars is because the pleating around the shoulders is pretty big - I felt it was a little over-the-top, and more practically, it made it hard to wear a cardigan over the dress in the cold weather. Overall though, a fun dress.","February 22, 2016","Large"

With an open back, this would be difficult, except that the material is sturdy and thick enough to offer support without a bra. A simple bandeau works well with the fabric and doesn't look bad. The waist is really narrow, which is perfect for an hourglass figure, but may not work for thicker waists.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going one size up for your back-up. This style is comfortable throughout the midsection and comfortable room at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are not really able to wear a standard bra with this dress. At 5'9"", the length hit floor length on me.This color is gorgeous, perfect for a daytime event in the spring time!","May 21, 2018","True to Size"

I think a 0P might've been perfect. The pink fabric was almost the right length if I wore my highest heels, but for some reason the sheer chiffon was an extra 3-4 inches longer so it was still impossible to walk (5'2"", 4 inch heels). The fabric itself is pretty enough, though a little rough, and the shape of the dress is pretty but a little tight.

The regular was long, so definitely wear heels. The waist fit well, but the bust was a bit big - I'm not sure if the dress was designed this way or it had been stretched out from previous wears; usually a 4R is well fitted to an A-cup, so that was frustrating. I recommend if you have a smaller chest, use tape. Liked the design and the dress was lightweight, which was great for a summer wedding.","September 20, 2018","True to Size"

I rented it again (without a backup dress sadly) in a 6 thinking it would be perfect and the SAME thing happened. Everything else about it fits and the tip was even too big on the 6 because I am so small chested. I had no choice but to wear the dress because I didn't bring a backup with me and had to attend a bridal shower so I wore it without it being zipped all the way with a sweater.

This is a very fitted dress at the waist and bust, however, so we recommend going up a size for your backup style. In addition, because there is a built in bodice for this top and it is a smaller fit, this look would work best for women with an A to C cup, as it may be uncomfortable for women with larger busts to wear.

The material fell beautifully and did not emphasize my stomach or make me self conscious at all. I tucked in the ruffle a bit around the waist to eliminate extra volume (super easy fix and it stayed all night) and I pinned the neckline just so I wouldn't have to worry about cleavage mishaps.

I was able to squeeze into it, but the waistline kept rising and my bust could have been more fitting.

The size 4 was a little tight and I was unable to zip. If you have non-straight hips & round bottom, then go with the 6.

Being a seamstress, therefore, I carefully hand stitched a sizeable dart in from the arm hole so that a breeze would not blow in one arm hole, across my chest and out the other armhole. The dress then fit flawlessly. The morning after I removed the same stitches without harm to the fabric.

This dress is so flowy and fun, with the high/low wrap in the front giving it a touch of sexy. So beautiful when the wind hits it. One thing is that the STRAPS DO NOT cross in the back as shown on the app, which I was a little bummed about. The bust area does cut down low if you do not wrap it properly, but I had no issues with it when the inside piece was pulled tight enough. A little double stick tape on the bust just to be safe, but it wasn't really necessary. Definitely recommend!","July 29, 2019","Wedding"

First, I could not figure out how to tie it. It took me forever to find the tiny hole near the armpit to put the string through in order to wrap it around my waist. Once I did, it took a few tries of wrapping the strings in different ways to figure out what looked best/how it was supposed to work. Second, the top was huge. I'm not large on top, but it was tough to wear. I had to use a safety pin to keep it closed and even then it was just too large up top and baggy. I had worn stick-on chicken cutlets but they were constantly out because the dress kept shifting and falling open. I ended up wearing the jacket in my picture only because I was self-conscious of them showing. I would recommend double-sided tape if you rent this. Even though the dress was beautiful, I wouldn't rent again. Too much hassle.","June 29, 2019","Large"

Once I figured out how to tie it haha! Ok I really had to watch a YouTube video as I was looking all over for a little hole to put the string through - the hole isn't at the front of dress like I thought just follow the seam where the string starts and it's more on the right side kinda behind where your armpit would be. Maybe the size small hole wouldn't have been so far behind my arm (if that makes sense) but once I had it all tied I thought the XSR fit. I don't have a bra on and I think the ruffles disguised my small chest. I tied it very tight and it felt secure. I thought the length was perfect with about 3.5 inch heels and didn't think it would expose much of my legs like I saw mentioned in prior reviews, only up to about my knee if I was walking, but I didn't actually wear it so this is just a guess. Material is light and flows. The pastel floral pattern is super feminine and I will rent this again because I have to be able to wear it somewhere!!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HP88","RTR Customer","Loved the dress but...","The dress fit like a glove. I selected it (and the backup style) because I knew the length would work (I'm 5'4) so I needed something a little shorter in front and a backup (since another size wasn't available) that allowed length adjustment with a belt. Turned out my backup wasn't available so they sent an alternative that didn't work at all (it was a weird one shoulder that was so low my flat side boob/armpit was overexposed). Then when I went to return my items on Monday (since you just need to return to UPS before noon) - no return label, no lock to secure the package - nothing. I didn't notice this since this was my first RTR experience and looked online for the info I needed - assuming I could easily print a return label from my account. I'm assuming Monday was a holiday for RTR since no one responded to my emails until Tuesday at 4. They sent a new label in the email, but by that time my return was already 2 days late. And since I didn't hear from customer service, I paid UPS to ship overnight for $140+ to avoid late fees. My stylist told me to refer my question about reimbursement for shipping to collections. . RTR's response was to disable late fees and offer a $30 credit. Ultimately I'm out $200+. Oh, and there's no phone number to call customer service. You just have to wait for emails.","November 14, 2018","Formal Affair"

I was at a summer wedding at a campground, and thought a more muted color and flows dress would be nice. I also thought I'd wear a chunky heel rather than a stiletto, and I had the perfect copper heel to go with it. I am 5'7.5"" and 128 lbs so I often wear between a 2 and a 4 (2's often snug and 4s often have extra room somewhere), and this dress was similar. It didn't hug any curves, although it wasn't supposed to. The material was light enough for a summer or warmer event but could be appropriate for fall as well because of the color. The fit was almost like an a-line or shift and the ruffle and turtleneck are great style details that made this dress more unique. Half of the women at the wedding complimented me on this dress (as well as the blush colored tuxedo cape I also rented). The only problem was the turtleneck zipper. It kept getting caught in my hair all night :/ Would rent again!","June 18, 2017","Wedding"

It's so sleek and flattering and different and interesting. It's VERY thin and skims your body very closely, so unless you have a tighter midsection than I do, be prepared to do some sucking in and standing straight ;-) If I owned any spanx this would probably have been a good opportunity to use them.

You can clearly see it when you walk. It's a terrible place for a tag. I wound up using fabric tape to try and hide it. Other than that, I received tons of compliments and the fit was perfect.

I have a 4 month old and am nursing and this was the perfect dress to look stylish in and still be able to feed the baby with ease. I brought extra dress tape. It fit decent in the body but with a little sag in the lower back bc it was a little bigger than my normal size. The sag was barely noticeable. If I had worn a MR, I would have been fidgeting with the chest coverage all night. I would recommend busty ladies and nursing moms to go up one size. I received a lot of compliments all night.

What I liked most about this dress was that you could adjust the waist to fit comfortably, because it is a wrap dress. I did need to use a couple of safety pins to secure the front part of the dress so that my bra was not completely exposed. I thought the length was perfect, fun, and flattering.

A little difficult to raise your arms, but otherwise comfortable. Best to wear a strapless bra with this dress, as any straps worn underneath will show. Sleeves were a bit long, but easily fold over. Even though I'm 5'3"", the length was a little on the short side for my taste. Easily fixed with leggings or black tights. Overall loved the dress!","March 4, 2019","True to Size"

Usually between a size 10 and 12 and both sizes worked for me- ended up going with the 12 as it was a little longer and forgiving in the belly area (not a lot of stretch). Loved the sleeves, still a little sexy while also being a bit more modest. Think this dress would honestly work for any body type!!","January 6, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW310","RTR Customer","Cute, but be wary of the arms!","I wore this super cute dress to my work holiday party, and after reading the reviews I decided to get the 0 which is my true size. I would say this dress runs a little on the smaller side, just because the arms were tight and the bands that runs over the shoulders was also a bit restricting for lifting my arms. It was a nice length, not too short but didn’t make me look Amish. Would definitely recommend but maybe get 2 sizes or size up just in case!","December 18, 2018","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW310","Elina","Fun little black dress for a party.","I ordered a size 10 which is my normal dress size and the fit was definitely a bit snug. The dress was short as is and just kept riding up even more. I was not looking forward to having to fix my dress every 5 minutes. Thank goodness for the the free backup because the size 12 fit perfectly. The ruffles around the shoulders for sure made it hard to lift my arms as its very tight all the way around, not made for raising your hands so don't try it unless you want your dress to go all the way up. At the end of the day I was satisfied but probably wouldn't wear it again.","December 12, 2018","Small"

The shoulder area is not lace, but more of a crocheted-esque make up.

I did not wear this dress though because the bodice has to different sets of seams that were really unflattering on me. It was like an empire waist and then another seam at my natural waist. The fabric between the two bunched up and didn't looks great. If you have a long torso this dress would probably be a home run.","October 26, 2018","Party"

My back-up size was an 8R, because the dress is basically a column so I wanted to be prepared for minimal give since I'm hippy; but the 8R fit the same as the 6R (true to size) so I don't know if that was an error on one of the tags.

I was wearing this dress, a last-minute replacement from RTR that seemed fine — nothing special, but good enough for government work (or, given that this was a fundraising gala, non-government work). We were hungry. We'd been in formal dresses and heels for hours, and the BTS staff didn't get enough to eat. So we ordered pizza. I went down to get it, in this dress and heels. The elevator doors were about to close; an arm comes out of nowhere. A gentleman gets on the elevator. He looks at me, in this dress, with heels and three boxes of pizza. It's a long ride, even in a fast elevator — 35 flights. He can't contain his curiosity. ""Okay,"" he says, gesturing to my dress and the pizza boxes. ""I have to know the story here."" The dress may have seemed like nothing special when I tried it on in a fit of fashion-induced exhaustion and the remains of a Thanksgiving food coma. But in that moment, on that elevator, it compelled Jeff Goldblum to speak to me. And for that alone, it warrants 5 stars. For what is fashion, if not another means of connecting with our fellow humans? If not another means of helping life find a way? It was pretty comfortable, too.","December 10, 2019","True to Size"

I read the reviews and sized up (I can wear 2-4 and went with a 6). The fit was perfect. Yes the arm loops are strange and you can't raise your arms up high but for a get-together with friends it was perfect. I ended buying this dress I loved it so much. This would be a perfect date night dress!!","February 28, 2019","Party"

Great condition, beautifully made, the arm sleeves are restricting. No sudden arm movements allowed lol","February 25, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Jessica","Hot red dress!","After reading the reviews I ordered my normal size a 6 and the 8 as a back up. There wasn't that big of a difference in the body part of the dress between the 6 and the 8, however I could not fit my arms into the armholes of the size 6. The arms on the 8 were tight, but doable. Now keep in mind this will restrict your arm movements. So if you want to have your hands in the air like you just don't care, this is not the dress for you. The body of the dress has a little stretch in it but not a ton. I did end up wearing spanks underneath because without them you see a lot of lines. The color of the dress is amazing, and you will stand out and turn heads. My plan was to buy this dress after I had worn it, however that's no longer an option with rent the runway. This was disappointing to learn. Just be smart when you are ordering your size, and keep the arm restriction issues in your mind. You will love this dress!","February 21, 2019","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","RTR Customer","Gorgeous dress!","I ordered this dress as my backup for a school formal and didn’t end up wearing it but still loved it. I found it to be a little tighter than I would’ve liked and it would’ve been hard to dance in. I will say it does have extremely small arm holes and once the dress is on, you can’t really move you’re arms much. But overall very pretty and classy looking. Loved the color, shape, and fabric, it was also extremely comfortable. Would definitely recommend.","February 6, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Janeris","Too tiny","I rented this dress after seeing it had some spandex. I need stratchy dresses because I'm pear shape. To fit my chest, I need a small dress that gives in the hips. This did not stretch at all. It was so small and the sleeves were so tight. Im and 8 and would need a 12 to be able to wear this. But the top would be too loose. I think the sleeve would be uncomfortable even at the right size. I'm so grateful for rtr's customer service.they got me a replacement dress the next day.","January 24, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Hannah","Flattering dress, but had to tuck in sleeves","I run between 6-8 and I got the 8 and it fit like a glove, so if you're in between sizes, is size up. It was so flattering and I felt great, but ultimately decided on another option because it was a little constricting at the bottom and I wanted to dance at my event. I did have to tuck in the sleeves because they were too small for my arms to be comfortable.","January 4, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Courtney","Sexy Holiday Stunner","I wore this dress to my husband's Air Force holiday party this past December. It certainly got a lot of looks! The dress is sexy without being too much and still classy. It's the perfect holiday/ Valentine's Day red. It fits a tad snug, so I would order up a size just in case. Love this off-the-shoulder piece!","January 4, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Vanessa","Sophisticated and fun","This was a lovely number in a luscious, holiday-ready vibrant red. The fit was decent, if not slightly wide in the hips. If you have a narrow frame, beware that Likely sizing trends towards smaller bust with roomier hips. Difficult to raise your arms much given the sleeves, so not ideal for energetic dancing. For my occasion, this was not an issue.","January 4, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Allison","Before event.","I loved this dress but it was a bit too casual for a black tie optional event. I will definitely rent this dress again but will size up. The arm sleeves were squeezing my arms and I couldn't fully zip up the dress.","December 4, 2018","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Shayna","Very flattering dress! Loved it.","I didn't have a problem dancing. A little restrictive with the arms but it didn't bother me at all. Wouldn't be good if you have bigger arms","November 22, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Colleen","It looked great on my body & figure","The arms were a bit annoying to move around in it wasn't very comfortable. It did run a bit small both times.","November 16, 2018","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","L","Classic Red!","Loved the fit on this for my petite frame. Worked well since the dress is strapless so no need to worry about it sliding down. Great color and cute arm sleeves!","October 31, 2018","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Giselle","Bombshell Uniform","Looooove this dress. Wore it for my birthday party. It was the second dress for the day. Between the color and the body hugging construction of the dress is a winner!!! About the sleeves, yes there was a small tear on one of the sleeves ( if you are wearing this dress to do everyday mundane things, then don't rent. Otherwise you'll b fine) I danced my butt off at a Bruno Mars concert n I was fine! Also wore no underwear *nothing* fabric is heavy enough.","October 15, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Kim","Sexy yet classy red dress with a tight fit!","This dress was actually one of my backups that I ended up wearing by popular demand from my sister and boyfriend. The red color is bold and pops out. It's a very sexy yet elegant dress because of the length. At times I felt restricted in it because of how tight it hugged my body. I have larger legs and thighs and felt I couldn't take as big of strides when walking because of the tightness. I have a smaller chest and I did not wear a bra. Love the cuffs although they do feel tight and I thought I'd rip them off from dancing. I couldn't raise my arms high for hugs and dancing, and it became a funny joke throughout the night lol. It was difficult to even tie my hair up also. Not the most comfortable dress but you'll feel sexy in it for sure!","October 9, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Katy","Great color, great fit","Wore this to a show. Loved the fit. Appropriate length. But now we have to talk about RTR as a whole. Over the past three months, the decline has been extremely palpable. I have received wrong items numerous times. Outside the New York area, my packages miss their delivery dates 100% of the time. The wait time for customer service has been well over 30 minutes- or even better- a recorded message saying their phone lines are tied up, instructing the caller to email, and hanging up. Unlimited items go quickly so when I am choosing a replacement item for RTR's screw up, I am choosing from what is available at that moment and it needs to be processed quickly. Instead, email responses take 24 hours, items I chose are no longer available, and I have to spend more time choosing items. This really defeats the purpose of a RTR subscription. I was told the reason for the poor customer support is they are over stretched for the holidays. It's early October and this has been going on for at least two weeks- if they are overstretched in September and October, can you imagine what it will be like in November and December- when the holidays are actually relevant? Recently I have also noticed that many of the items RTR advertises- that I wait and wait to come available on the app (you guys ever thought of adding a notification bell feature?), don't actually exist. If you go to the 4day rental calendar, it is greyed out through as far as you can go- and that's not bc the item is that popular- no one decided in October to rent a romper for a Tuesday through Friday in February. And finally customer service did confirm that they don't actually have the item in my size anymore. A quick search (10 min long) of some other items I was excited to wear showed me 4 more items that don't exist. This is false advertising- your customers want to know what the actual size of your stock is. It's a consumer protection issue- you are advertising a much larger stock than you actually have and misleading customers about the value of your service. I feel the value delivered has only decreased over the past few months and that the price of unlimited should drop at least $40 to represent that until RTR gets their customer service and supply chain in order. I'm strongly considering leaving the RTR family after the sharp decline in service I have experienced since July - in August, I received a whopping four items on time the entire month that were not damaged or the wrong item. I ordered a Tanya Taylor dress and received - I kid you not - dirty sweatpants. Cmon. It's such a good idea- stop messing it up!","October 6, 2018","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Melanie","This dress was a knock-out! I felt like a million bucks","The dress is definitely form fitting, and I felt better wearing Spanx. But, given the off-the-shoulder look and that the bust is tighter I was able to go without a bra (32C). The arms were a little tight and restricted mobility, but as long as you aren't planning on crazy dancing you should be good.","September 20, 2018","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","RTR Customer","Cute and comfortable!","Runs true to size! It was my backup dress and I only ordered one size. Maybe slightly big through the waist/hips (I am narrow), but not enough to matter. Super comfortable, and I didn't have any issues lifting my arms while dancing. I didn't have to wear a bra and it stayed up just fine. The arm bands make it cute and different! The fabric is nice and thick but stretchy. Would highly recommend.","September 14, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL60","Samantha","Such a fun night in general!","The dress fit like a glove. I got compliments all night on the bright color and the way it hugged my curves. To echo prior reviews, I will say the arm bands are reeeeeally tight and a little constricting, but overall was completely satisfied with the dress itself.","September 10, 2018","Small"
