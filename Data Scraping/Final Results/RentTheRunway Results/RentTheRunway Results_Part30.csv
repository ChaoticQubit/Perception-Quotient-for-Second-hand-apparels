It loses its shape by the end of the day, but hanging it up corrects that for the next wear. The bottom half is an open knit, so in cooler climates, you'll need to wear something under it. I'm in CA and can wear a tank or not. It is super warm, and slightly on the larger size, so roomier than I expected but still with a great fit that's not oversized and boxy. I usually prefer a medium in tops but sized up due to arm length, and this fits perfectly.","January 4, 2020","Work"

I like the height of the waste, and would give these 5 stars for how easy and casual they are, but I couldn't bend over or stand up from a sit without the buttons unpopping.

The inner thigh seams scrape against eachother and it makes a loud sound that's definitely noticeable. Also, they fit very snugly through the leg, thigh and ankle, but billowed by almost 2 inches at the waist. They are not button fly, but three very shallow snaps which, despite being 2"" too wide, still managed to unsnap when I bent over. Too bad because without these weird three things these jeans would actually be perfect. I might try a 28 to see if the waist fits better but I assume the leg will also get tighter which would be too uncomfortable. :(","March 10, 2020","True to Size"

This dress is really pretty, flattering, and the fabric is comfortable. If I was a little more busty or perhaps 5'5"", I think it would have been an A+ fit. As-is, it's a touch loose but still fit nicely. I think that a size 2 would have been too tight in the hips. I paired it with a wide black belt and a pair of nylons.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VB18","Meg","LOVE it, one of my all time fav rentals","I had been watching for this dress to become available for weeks and snapped it up as soon as I saw it, and I'm so glad I did. It's just as perfect as I'd imagined. The cut is so flattering. The small waist is really what makes it work, it's loose and easy breezy but doesn't hang like a sack. The cut is overall good for petite frames, not too long or too deep V. The print is darling and the fabric is super light. I didn't have a single issue with it. I'd say it runs true to size. I'm usually a 6 and took a risk on the 4 here. It fits, but just barely, so stick with your true size (size down if your primary size isn't in stock and you have a small waist).","July 17, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VB18","Erin","Flattering, comfy, easy to wear = all around win","This dress was super cute and fun to wear. The tie at the top is a unique detail that also helps cinch the waist of the dress to make it super flattering. I'm usually a size 10, but it wasn't available. The 8 was a little small but loosened the longer I wore it. I'd recommend renting you usual size or going up a size because the buttons are real! Had a couple of button scares that probably could have been avoided if I would have been wearing a size up.","July 4, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VB18","Chelsea","Classy summer dress","Loved everything about this dress. The fit is classy, length is perfect, no gaping between buttons.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VB18","Jodi","Equally great at work, on the go, or at an event","The length was actually great on my short (barely 5'1) frame which is rare. It was blousy up top, fitted at the waist, and one of the buttons gaped a little which I hate but it wasn't large, it's just the fit and make of the buttons. It looked equally good running around the city on an unbearably hot day as it did in the office, and I'd definitely wear it for an event or summer evening if I owned it (which I would like to once the price comes down!) Perfect spring/summer dress!","June 11, 2019","Everyday"

I loved the tie which was flattering even from the side. The skirt at the stomach area was forgiving, but I would size up depending on your comfort with tighter fabric around that area. Also, the armholes are low beneath the armpit, so there could be some side-boob issues depending on your bra of choice.

First to a party with a tight cream sweater tucked in with gold jewelry & black stilettos. They looked pretty good although I hated that the elastic waistband showed in the back. The second time I wore them with the matching shirt to work. I was cozy & warm all day (it was a very cold day) but I was overwhelmed by all the fabric & felt like all you noticed were my hips. Alas!

I'm usually a 2 these days, and found the 34R to be quite loose (although not unwearable, and not the worst thing for a Christmas dinner). These were a little long even with 2.5-3"" heels for me (5'2""), but manageable. The high waist is fantastic, very flattering.

It's modest with the long sleeves and high neck line, but snug throughout and definitely hugs curves. If you prefer looser dresses would not suggest this one- I don't think going up a size would help necessarily because that's the way the dress is meant to be. I'm 5'8 and it hits at mid thigh. Wore with tights and short booties.","January 24, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TH184","Rita","Cool dress, but with a few problems","So this dress is cute and the zipper in front adds interest to what would be a more basic black dress. I liked this dress; it was comfortable and appropriate to wear to work. There are two things that prevented me from loving this dress. The first is that the collar is slightly pointed, almost 70s like, and I thought that looked silly. The second are the sleeves which have a similar sort of 70s feel by being almost bell but not all the way. I ended up wearing this dress despite my concerns because I rolled the sleeves and figured the collar wasn't as noticeable to others as I felt it was.","January 20, 2020","True to Size"

I tried wearing a 2 - even though I am small chested this pulled across the bust, which resulted in puckering . The dress also runs a bit short- I could have managed the length with dark tights if the fit had been better in the bust. I might try to size up to a 4, if I decide to rent this again.","December 23, 2019","Date"

The straps/neckline fit almost like a halter, so you’ll definitely want to look at a strapless bra. I wore a white button down underneath, so didn’t have to fuss. Pants are flutter/flyaway, which rode up a little when I sat or crossed my legs. I may buy this, I felt so good in it, and the color is really beautiful.

It was a little short for me vertically, as I'm tall. Not sure if a size up would have helped, but I only wore it for a few hours so it was fine. Really a beautiful piece.

The torso length was a bit short in that I had a slight wedgie all day, and the chest was reeeeal tight. Since I was wearing the jacket I unzipped it partially when I had the jacket on.

The fabric is heavy and wraps around the leg so that there is a hidden slit just above the back of your knee. When you walk, the split in the leg of the pants really flows nicely! I have a long torso, so the 4 was a little bit tight in the neck/caboose directions, but the waist was adjustable and fit perfectly.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SIM13","Sondra","Comfy cozy fun, too large and fuzzy","I love this sweater and am looking forward to trying a smaller size. On the plus side, the design of the colorblocking is amazing and unique. The colors go great with the Caara Tortine Plaid Skirt in an 'interesting' colorblock-mixing way, which is why I ordered it in the first place. The sweater is very cozy and comforting. I rate it as 4 stars because of the shape and fabric fuzz. The shape is loose and flowy around the hips, especially because the size was too big for me, but I can see the same type of 'crease' in the loose fit on the model. The angora/lane & other 'ingredients' blend is relatively soft (though a bit scratchy). I understand the particular sweater that arrived had only been rented 4 times, but it had a lot of fuzz balls on the lower half and fuzzy edges on the hemline and sleeve ends. The fuzzballs are probably easy to fix with a pumice stone, but that takes effort, and on a rental it's not clear whether a customer should be fixing fuzz balls in that way. If I had bought the sweater I have no doubt I could take care of the fuzz balls safely and easily and get the sweater looking in top shape. I tried the Size US 12 and it's way to big for me. I realized after it arrived that the US 12 is a EUR 44, and I should probably be wearing a EUR 40. I'm returning the 44 to try a smaller size and can't wait for it to arrive. I love the design of this sweater and am optimistic that the right size will turn this into an amazing sweater for me :)","November 30, 2019","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ZMC7","B","Fun Jumpsuit! Great for Taller Women, but Baggy in the Top","This is the first jumpsuit that actually fit me well. It had a solid elastic waistband and it didnt ride up. The top was a bit baggy for me but anyone with a larger chest would fill it out nice. Either way, there is a button to keep the top from opening up. It is still a little low cut, so you might want to wear a bandeau. The fabric is a little sheer, but unless you are wearing hot pink underwear I dont think it would be a problem.","November 14, 2019","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ZMC7","Mirabelle","Almost loved it.","The color, texture, fabric and style are spot on. My only issue with this is that it's a bit slim in the bottom, which doesn't seem to match with the generous comfort in the top. The elastic band was new and still felt pretty snug. I'm sure it will loosen over time, but coupled with the slim pant- I didn't fall in love as I had hoped. I'm a true hourglass shape and found that sitting in this jumper was unflattering, and ultimately chose not to wear it because there is no where that I could realistically wear it without sitting (too warm to wear for running errands all day in this heat). I would definitely rent this again in the fall. Not sure I'd size up because the top would be way too large. Just be cautious if you have a fuller bottom.","July 25, 2019","True to Size"

They are stretchy so they relaxed through the day and hung a bit better in the cool/slouchy way that the style needs, but I think generally these will fit shorter people better. If I got a bigger size they might fit better in length, but in terms of the waist and hips I could have used a smaller size, not larger. Also, the tie is super short so the only thing to do with it is let it stick out in a single knot. That said they are super cute, comfortable, and stylish.","December 5, 2019","Work"

With this pant, you really have to tuck in your top, the attached tie makes it impossible to do otherwise. So if your stomach isn't flat, you are going to see that, though I have to admit it wasn't as bad as I thought. I ended up wearing it with a white shirt and a kimono cut loose knit sweater, which looked pretty good. The cuffs and cut at the bottom were the best though.

Unfortunately, it was just super bulky on me especially in the shoulder and chest area. I felt like a linebacker/drowning in it so I didn't end up wearing. The shoulders are huge and arms and length are long yet it's unlikely my back and shoulders would fit in a smaller size. It seems this is much better suited to taller gals.

It's very cropped, so it works best with high waist jeans. The neck was kind of over stretched but I didn't mind.

One part that I loved was the frayed hem which made them just the right length without having to roll up the bottom of the jeans with boots. They were perfect in every way and I highly recommend! I typically wear 29, but these were available in 30 and they were perfect, so I think you could either wear your normal size or go up one size and be OK.","December 19, 2019","True to Size"

It runs a little on the small side, so I would size up, and know that it is a little itchy, but not really bad. Overall it is a great everyday wearable item; wish I could afford to buy it!!","February 19, 2020","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Lauren","Lots of compliments!","Distressed edges on sleeves and waist made it extra fun. So many comments and compliments. This everyday sweater brings out the fun and whimsy.","February 2, 2020","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Kate","Comfy pop of color","I wore this to a sporting event with my kids. It was super comfy and a nice change from the typical grey hoodie I would normally wear. It's a sweater (not sweatshirt) but not itchy/scratchy at all. A bit thin / see through so I wore a tank under","January 23, 2020","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Rebecca","So soft! Also came brand new with tags :)","Loved the fit, not super tight. Could wear a light tank underneath, but not needed because it's so soft. Also not heavy and good for all weather.","September 10, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Ac","So fun","Warm but lightweight wool sweater. I absolutely loved it once I took it out of the package and I received so many compliments. You can't tell from the picture but the sleeve and bottom are frayed at the ends which is just another interesting detail. It doesn't look bad but if you're expecting ""regular"" end seams. you may want to know this.","September 7, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Ruthi","Love!","It fits very comfortably. It is slightly fitted, I'd say but I was also very bloated when I took the picture & it will fit looser in a few days on me, so it might just be perfectly sized for a hoodie. I love the paint splatter pattern especially on a cashmere (blend, I think? Maybe not) sweater! I picked it specifically for that reason - I love mixing more classic styles with very much current trends. I will be purchasing this soon, because of how *me* it is- my mom actually said I should & if you knew her, you'd be shocked - she very rarely agrees with single item buys over $100 for clothing but when she does, it ends up being an item I use a decade later (28, I can say that now, oh wow, hahah).","September 5, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Jeny","Wanted to love it, but sized for a child!","Fun splatter design but WAY too tiny. The hoodie pocket was basically up at my breast level.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Rebecca","Fancy hoodie","Flattering fit and fun print. The wool makes it a nicer style for every day wear but it also makes it a warm sweater.","February 24, 2020","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Sally","Unique and colorful","Pretty fitted especially in the arms. Also on the cropped side. I saw that it ran small which is one reason I ordered (I'm on the petite side and many designers just don't work). If you are tall I suspect this will be too cropped. Love the frayed hem and the crisp white with smashes of color to brighten up winter.","December 12, 2019","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Jessica","This sweatshirt is so fun! I got so many compliments on it.","I normally wear a large, but based on reviews I ordered an XL and was glad I did. It fits like a large. The sweater is a little see-through, but as long as you wear something underneath, you'll be fine. The drawstrings are long, but not annoyingly so. The picture doesn't show it, but the cuffs and hems are frayed and ""worn"".","December 10, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Irene","Such a cute sweater!","I LOVE this sweater/sweatshirt! It looks like a sweatshirt from far away but it's actually wool. The design and raw edges are so cute! If it wasn't so expensive I'd totally buy it.","December 2, 2019","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/THP1","Wendy","Great fabric and print","I was so excited to wear this. I loved how it felt and thought the print was fun. But, it was too small on me. I guess an XL in an ""edgier"" brand isn't the same as, for example, an XL in Athleta, where a hoodie like this would have fit me just fine (offering this info for comparison).","November 6, 2019","Everyday"

Casual for running around town in gym shoes, but the shredded hem and hoodie detail, paint-splash color, and kangaroo pocket made for easy sightseeing, while I still felt put together. Worth a rent.","November 1, 2019","True to Size"

My husband who never pays attention to my clothes complimented me and loved the shirt too. My only complaint is that I noticed the material started to pill from my seatbelt and purse.
