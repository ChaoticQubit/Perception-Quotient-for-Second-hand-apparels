Super comfortable and easy to pack (I brought it on a vacation so I could wear over a t-shirt and jeans and not look like a slob). Matches everything as it is an inoffensive navy/black combo. Only annoyance was the inner lining. It was too large for the jacket so it peeks through at the end of the sleeves.","June 9, 2019","True to Size"

It was the standard size that I normally get and I'd say that it ran just a little big I could've probably gone down one size. Regardless of it being a bit oversized it was still very beautiful and I got a ton of compliments on it. I really like the elastic in the waist you don't have to worry about it fitting in the waist area and it's very roomy in the chest which is normally an issue for me.","July 25, 2019","Work"

It was a bit large in the waist as it has some elastic but it is flowy so you can't tell at all. I got so many compliments! Perfect for a breezy summer day work and outdoor cocktails afterwards. Could dress up if you wanted, but was so flattering even with sandals. You'll love it.","June 14, 2019","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS188","Samantha","Great dress!","This dress is so flattering. The neckline is great and where it tightens at the waist gives you the perfect shape.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS188","Aurora","Perfect date night transition to spring piece!","This dress was very flattering on- loose and flowy on the bottom but the cinched waist shows your shape. The neck and wrist had pretty cinched detailing as well. I wore this for a date night-others had said they wore it to work- however I felt the neckline was a bit low - I wouldn't feel comfy without a cami underneath for a professional setting. Length was just above the knee. Great for spring, love the floral print!","April 28, 2019","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS188","Garilee","So comfortable!","One of my favorite Kate Spade dresses. Lightweight and comfortable with elastic waist and elastic cuffs.

It was so pretty and feminine and I felt great in it. The high neck and keyhole detail on the front gave it a unique look. The dress was perfect for my friend's rehearsal dinner! Highly recommend especially for my tall ladies!","March 14, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS188","Rebecca","Beautiful dress, even better customer service!","I selected this dress as a last-minute replacement after my first three choices weren't going to work for the cold weather that was anticipated. SO. GLAD. I. DID. This dress made me feel like a million bucks! The fabric is lightweight and luxurious, but heavy enough to wear with tights and/or boots in winter weather. The button at the neckline can be secured for a keyhole look, but this was for date night so I left it open. The smocked waist has a LOT of give; I could have sized down but I felt secure with the little bit of extra fabric in the right places. Super happy with RTR's impeccable service, too! My first three dresses just wouldn't work, and I had three new dresses on my doorstep by 10am the next morning.","March 4, 2019","Date"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS188","Lisa","Cute but fit off on me","Pretty print, conservative for work, looks good with tights for cooler weather. Comfortable. Can button or unbutton the neck for 2 different looks. Fit was off on me (I wore a small), sleeves fit but the waist sat high and the elastic would creep even further up to under my bust, making it look like a very short maternity dress. Maybe the medium would have been better?","November 16, 2018","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS188","Paula","Didn't end up wearing","Unfortunately didn't end up wearing because the fit under the armpits was way too tight and made the dress uncomfortable.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS188","Katherine","Nice quality but forgettable","This dress is high quality and the pattern is lovely for fall, but it just wasn't special.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS188","Samantha","Easy, comfortable dress but a bit large","This dress was fine but nothing special. I rented a M because I was concerned the waist in the S would ride up based on other reviews, but I think the S would have been better. It just felt big and like a lot of fabric. However, it was easy to wear and a pretty pattern so I might rent again and size down.","March 8, 2020","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MSGM87","Autumn","Comfy and Cute with some pop","I love this sweater and so did everyone else! I usually wear a medium and got a large even with knowing that it was oversize.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MSGM87","Lisa e","Comfy and bright","Nice oversized sweater with cool bright colors. Definitely very oversized (big through the body, in the length, and very long arms) so order your size or down. There are zippers on either side which are kind of cool (it looks nice if you unzip them a couple of inches to give it a side vent), but they were also sort of jingly so it’s a toss-up on those for me. Material is as expected for acrylic/wool blend - soft-ish. There is a bit of a stiff tulle material that is stitched inside along the shoulder seam - I assume this is to keep the shoulders from stretching out, but it is VERY itchy. I am usually not bothered by things like that but I did find it quite scratchy.","March 19, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MSGM87","Marcy","Unexpected hit","This was an unexpected hit with both myself and my followers. The color combination of the blue and red is unique and interesting. I loved the oversize fit, especially the long sleeves.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MSGM87","Diane","Cute, very comfy, very warm","As other reviews have stated, this is a very over-sized sweater. If you're looking for a nice, warm, comfy over-sized sweater, this is the one. The color pops out and when worn with black leggings, it's very cute. The sleeves are very long - now, the super long sleeves are in fashion but mind you, it does get annoying and gets in the way. I ended up folding my sleeves while wearing this sweater. It's VERY WARM, I wore this at a 30-something degree sunny Chicago winter weather and it still kept me warm! (Of course, if you stay out there too long it's going to get eventually cold) I would rent this again.","February 27, 2019","Large"

I didn't expect it to make me look so very broad and large. I think you definitely need some height to pull this off if you are on the larger and bustier side. I ended up not wearing this because I just wasn't comfortable. I gave it two stars because it was incredibly soft and I really did like the zippers on the sides.","November 21, 2018","Large"

The material is heavy, great for cooler temperatures, and I think the zippers and pockets give it a fun look. The belt has NO give, so it really has to fit your waist for it to work (I had on tights and some shaping underwear, to be frank). But once on, it's pretty comfortable (I wore it all day, including on a bus and for several hours of driving). The sleeves are a bit odd, with almost sweatshirt-type wrists - seems a bit out of place for the dress - but it's not really noticeable. I wore this twice, once for work and once for a conference, and would have purchased it if it wasn't so expensive.","November 27, 2017","True to Size"

I almost returned without wearing but TBH it was laundry day and I was running low on my own stock. The pattern was a little busier than it looks on screen and the zipper neck it just kind of bizarre. Well apparently no one else thought so because people were complimenting me on the dress all day. It was very comfortable and not sheer at all. One thing I have to say about this dress is the genius way they did the bell sleeve. Usually a bell sleeve will flop all around which can be annoying. There are hidden buttons behind the ""bell"" on the sleeves of this dress that make it tight to your wrist - no flopping. Brilliant.","May 31, 2019","Work"

Loved the fun tassels and hippy look- way out of my usual comfort zone. The string at the bust needs to be double knotted, as the silk cord slips and loosens. Lots of boobs on me, but it added a little sass to a very loose fitting maxi. Length was perfect for flats on my 5'5"" frame- even better with a platform sandal. Winner!","August 16, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FG8","Tracy","Colorful and fun","I enjoyed this dress. Yes, it's sheer, but the pattern sort of hides that. I had to go with a L because my normal M wasn't available. Because it had a cinched tie waist, I was able to make it work, but it would have been much better in my normal size. The v-neck is very low and did not work for me without a cami underneath the dress. Not sure if my normal size would have worked better or not. It's not one of those throw on fun summer dresses that you can wear over and over again bc it's just a bit dressier, but I did enjoy.","August 5, 2019","True to Size"

The favorite feels so nice as it is silk. The print is vibrant and with all the colors in it, it is easy to coordinate accessories with it. It flows when you walk, the tassels are huge, but you can get away with it with the busy pattern. The length was perfect on me. I got lots of compliments on the dress. I hope to rent this one again.","July 24, 2019","Work"

It's a lightweight, lined dress (not sheer at all), and there isn't any stretch to it, so a pear shape may want to size up.

The dress is beautiful and the material is very nice, but the fit is totally off. I had to size up because my usual size was unavailable so I thought this would be big and I'd have to belt it. I was wrong! It's big in the arms and chest and tight in the hips. The pockets are big and hit you right at the hips as well, which makes for an even more unflattering look.

I have no chest to fill out the front so the large seemed too big--I definitely needed a cammi. Maybe a M would have worked better but would it have covered my Buddha belly?

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF290","Danielle","Frumpy","This dress looked so cute and flirty in the photos, but unfortunately it makes me look like a frumpy middle aged woman. The only thing that could make the dress worse is if you were to wear a tank top underneath which most women would do as it is unnecessarily open no matter how tight you wrap it around. I personally enjoy a fair amount of cleavage, but this dress makes it look awful. The dress hugs in all the wrong places and does not compliment my figure at all which is a major fail as this style of dress usually suits me. I can't think of anyone it would look good on. Also the way the wrap dress is designed it leaves an open hole on the side of your stomach where the ""wrap"" goes through.","September 13, 2019","Everyday"

I rented it for a causal holiday party but it arrived early, so I was also able to wear it to work. My only complaint was that it definitely needed a top layered underneath, since the knit was very open in some places and it was a little short for me and my long torso. (Not really a big complaint, I just would prefer to not have to layer.) Could have worn the XS or S but went with the XS, since the sleeves were a little less wide.","December 20, 2018","Everyday"

Parties, work, dinner, errands. Only complaint is I think the RTR system isn't great for knits. The sweater i received looked a little worse-for-wear with some pilling and overall ""shagginess"" like you might expect form a chunky sweater that's been worn several times by different renters and laundered.

The material is lightweight and the center slit comes up just to above the knee making the skirt breezy and flirty. I would say this skirt runs large; I'm a true hourglass that usually wears a 6/8 or medium. The small fit fine, if perhaps slightly tight over my hips. Because of the loop and eye style of buttons you may get some pulling where it is tight. The skirt was very high waisted. I have a long torso so this was fine. Shorter ladies with short torsos may find it too long. Also if you are self conscious about your tummy you may want to wear spanx.","June 21, 2019","Everyday"

Also the large slit (as reviews noted) is right in the front. I got a little creative and tied the straps around my waist and into a knot on one side.

As far as sweater dresses go, this style is one of my favorites. As a wrap dress, it gives shape that pull-over knit dresses sometimes lack. There's no lining and only one button on the inside and one tie, so with the side slits and not-complete closure in the front, this requires some saavy when it comes to styling.

I paired it with black ""snakeskin"" ankle boots and I felt so effortlessly chic. Like all wrap dresses, it shows A LOT of leg when you walk, but I felt like it was a little more demure because it's ankle-length. The top also isn't as revealing as a lot of wrap dresses because it has an inside button that pulls it together. It was super cute, and the perfect amount of coverage for a 60 degree day. It runs a little large in the arms & shoulder, but I don't know that it's enough to size down. But I also wore it to work and that was a mistake - it's just too revealing, especially when you're sitting. I safety-pinned the front together at about mid-thigh before a client meeting and that worked well enough. But still, I'd only wear in a casual sitting.","December 11, 2019","Large"

I wore it with jeans and booties and It was so comfortable and warm. The only issue was since the design is evenly split between the ""front"" and ""back"" (by the splits in the side) and I have a larger butt than average it pulled the fabric back.

My point is this was PERFECT for working from home! I woke up for that hella early video call and threw this dress on with some red lipstick ET VOILA- perfectly chic at 6a with no effort. My spouse felt it was a little to Salt-n-Peppa circa 1987 (he started pelvic thrusting and singing Push It). He meant it as an insult because he doesn't realize that the 80s are back with a fierceness that's cooler than the Cold War.

Order a size down if that's something that would bothersome to you. Me personally? I loved that, it allowed me to comfortably roll up, and push up the sleeves; Which I am all about.

It's pretty light-weight so wasn't ideal for the Minnesota winter, probably would work with another lightweight turtleneck or something under it.

I love the asymmetrical hem of the dress. The zipper is a little risque for my work (attorney for a state agency) but the dress isn't short on me (I'm 5'1''), so I figured it was okay. The dress fits a little tighter than usual in the rib cage area, but not uncomfortably. My only real issue with the dress? The hem! It's completely undone. I didn't notice until I got to work, so I'm going to have to live with it all day, which is pretty annoying. It completely changes the angles of the dress and kind of ruins the look. I'm not sure if it's meant to be sewed or ironed to hold its hem, but it's not working now! Too bad, because it's an attractive dress otherwise. Wouldn't rent again just due to the hem issue.","February 5, 2020","True to Size"

I'm not the biggest fan of the cropped, ""big chest in a tiny coat-look,"" so I was glad to see that this jacket truly was long enough. The fit though. Maybe it's me? I love the oversized look, but this jacket isn't structured enough to look good (on me) as an oversized piece. It kinda just looks like I'm wearing my boyfriend's jacket (and not in a cute, intentional way). It was hard to capture the issue in a picture; in this one, I'm holding all the extra, empty jacket to one side. Hopefully I just need a smaller size!","November 23, 2018","Everyday"

I love the idea of it, and I love the color and the black wrap detail.... but it's huge. Trying to pin it near the belt didn't help much, because it caused the dress to look off from behind. I wore this to work, and felt comfortable in the busy but realized the wrap detail resulted in a slit that might have been a bit more leggy than I would normally wear for work.

The only thing that I thought was strange was the tag - it's on the ruffle/waist portion so it definitely shows.

I'm usually between a 6 and an 8 in pants (27"" waist, 37"" hips), and I was SWIMMING in this 6. I'm a 5'8 woman in my 30s and I looked like a little turn-of-the-century urchin trying to hobble after a train. Cinching the waist didn't help, since there was so much fabric poofing around the hips and lower belly. (My only photo is a bit blurry, so I'm not sure it gets this across, but trust me.) Sizing down might help, but I expect that would make the rise shorter, and for my long torso that's not workable either.

And itchy...","Based on the model photo I was hoping I could wear this for just everyday stuff with leggings on RTR Update. The size 2 (I am usually a size S/M) didn't quite cover my butt, and I wasn't comfortable wearing it to work unless it did. But I probably would have for weekend activities during the day, it is oversized, but it is expected with this sweater. So after I tried it on immediately after receiving it, I thought I would swap it, but then the next morning I tried on again with jeans and I just loved the beautiful color and thought it would work. The keyhole in the back is adorable, and I love the sleeves! But after about 10 minutes I just couldn't take the itching. And I don't think I have sensitive skin. A long sleeved shirt with a low back could MAYBE work, but the sleeves on this sweater were really short. I am 5'4"" with short arms, and when I bent my arm the sleeves almost became 3/4 length.

The fabric feels cheap, and the fit was just off. I couldn't figure out if it was just my body type or the way the dress was made. I wore it by tying the two ""flaps"" in the front, shifted to the left side. Halfway through the work day, I started to think that I was wearing it wrong...but after checking how the model wears it, I think I did it right... There is a slit at either side of the dress at the rib cage, which I only discovered after having it on--they're covered up by the front flaps, but I still don't know what they were intended for. Anyway, with all that said, I felt comfortable throughout the day and (after getting used to it) thought it looked rather flattering.","March 6, 2019","True to Size"

The shirtdress part of this dress extends about mid-thigh, and I couldn't get the lowest buttons done up because the dress is narrow BUT that is okay because of the overskirt wrap. It is tricky to tie. Here's what I did: Take the left side of skirt and put the string through the hole on the right, threading it into the back of the dress underneath. Repeated on the opposite side (right thread through left hole). Then, I lifted up the dress in the back and tied the ties together underneath the dress. This kept the whole thing more closed. I also did the j crew-tuck on the sleeves since it's summer in LA and I wanted to have this with the sleeves rolled up. I am very tempted to buy this one and will keep it at least one more month. I wear it to work with heels but can see it would also be cute on the weekend with sneakers. It's elegant, classy, and just a little bit different/edgy.

They weren't too tight through the waist and hips, but did lay a little funny in the front. I think that's just because they're overalls.

Blank denim never does me wrong - fit is always true to size, definitely snug with some stretch. I'm 5'9"" so these were pretty cropped on me.

I paired with a tight black tee, one of my own basics.","February 22, 2019","True to Size"

Since they're so tight, when I sat down and got up, they were even shorter and I had to pull down the pant legs by ending over every time. I'm sure they'd be good on someone average height; but just not right for me.","February 15, 2020","Everyday"

It is a very beautiful pattern, more professional than a typical shirt dress, and the fabric is nice and breezy for the still-too-hot to be fall weather in my city. However, the fabric overall was strange. It felt like a stiff cotton that was thin at the same time. Due to the stiffness, it just kind of hangs on the body in an odd way and doesn't have much movement. Nude colored undergarments are a must. Due to the fabric, this dress WRINKLES very easily. It was a tad rumpled upon arrival from RTR (easily steamed out), but by the time I got to work, I was a wrinkled mess again. The fit was also slightly ""off"" for me. It felt tight in the waist (there is NO give to this fabric) but was very loose around the chest and hips. It would maybe work well on a different body type.","September 27, 2019","Small"

(I'm 5'8"") The jacket has two buttons and nipped at the waist just right, so I had curves rather than a fat boy look or a gapping jacket.

Still gave it 5 stars cause that's my bad, not the coat's. 10/10 would rent again (in a 16)","December 12, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SMY27","Alex","Super cute, but wanted to love it more","Loved how this romper looked in pictures, which I why I decided to rent it. The front is super cute, but the one big flaw is like a lot of other reviewers said, the straps are very prone to falling down... with the fabric and the way it's made you have to be very careful of this happening to avoid a major wardrobe malfunction. The fluttery cap sleeves kept getting flipped up weird on mine too or getting caught under the elastic part of the strap, so that required a decent amount of adjusting throughout the day. Took some adjusting to tie the wrap piece in a way that still made the top look flattering on me, but once I got it, it looked good and I didn't have to touch that again while I was wearing it. The skirt/shorts are a good length, not too short. Because of the open back you can't wear a regular bra, I opted to wear a bralette, even though that could be seen on the back just because I didn't want to have to really worry if the strap fell down too much. Overall, super cute, lightweight/breathable, and easy to get around in. I'm glad I rented it and got to try it because it is so cute, but probably wouldn't rent again because of how attentive I had to be about the straps all day.","June 19, 2019","True to Size"

Double-layer mesh type fabric provides coverage. Love the ruffle. Runs a bit big but I like that it isn't tightly fitted, and it is a good length. The only down side for me, the high neck and fabric made it a little warm for me...but I'm 52 and entering that time of life where I'm running hot! I also wore it on our hottest day of the summer, so there's that as well. I will definitely rent it again when our temps cool, it will be perfect for fall and spring!","July 26, 2019","Work"

I'm 7 months pregnant so I really didn't think it would be big !! It was too big pretty much everywhere. It's really nice fabric and a gorgeous print , but runs large and the ruffle on the neck is a bit extra. I think this would work a lot better on a petit person (not pregnant) and the ruffle might not feel as intense.","July 15, 2019","Work"

However, it is not that big for being a Large so I'd go with a medium next time for a comfortable fit or small for a more skin-tight fit. There is a lot of stretch as it is a netting material.

It's the perfect fashion print for this part of ""Spring."" The neckline was a bit funky, and the shirt felt a bit heavy from the ruffles on one side, as if I were being weighed down.

It felt a tad bit stretched out--this type of fabric tends to need a good wash to shrink back after wear--but was still flattering. Cap sleeves were nice if you don't love your shoulders. Although the fabric is stretchy and drapes, it isn't too thin. It has a higher neckline with a tie in the back and a dramatic ruffle on one side/shoulder. Worked well for me, but might be challenging for someone super busty. I wore with skinny black pants and black booties + loved!","February 6, 2019","Work"

It was definitely large and then some, since it's so stretchy. Unfortunately this made it look matronly on me. Perhaps it would look better on someone a little older?

It's such a cute work top to spice up regular slacks or basic skirt.

The dress is designed to be shaping but man, it was next to impossible to get into and out of--and I am not a curvy woman. The zipper didn't glide easily, the fabric was stretchy but not enough, and there's a weird built-in bra type of thing that prevents the top from stretching too.

My only complaint is that when zipped up, it sticks out at the bottom due to the slightly boxy cut. I'm a 36DDD, so might not be an issue for smaller-chested women.

However, this one fit my body all wrong. The chest was perfect with the elasticated material, but the straps were too big, constantly falling off my shoulders. The tummy area was so billowy that the part I love most about my pear-shaped body, my waist, looked huge, especially from the front. And the fabric doesn't help with its stiffness.

I took a risk as the largest size is a L, but it ran big from reviews and IT FIT! 👍👏👏👏 I should have taken a side view - it’s really flattering and sliming due to not too much fabric (plus size designers take note - just because- or especially because- we are plus size we DO NOT need 10 yards of fabric in a skirt!! I am a 36D, 39” waist and 49” hips. It *just* fit but I was comfortable in it. There is no stretch to the fabric but it does stretch out a bit as you wear it.
