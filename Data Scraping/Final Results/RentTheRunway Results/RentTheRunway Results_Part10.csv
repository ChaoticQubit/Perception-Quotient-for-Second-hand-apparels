Great neckline too - deep enough to look sexy but (even for small chested women like me) not self conscious. Love the pussy bow tie detail too. Got so many compliments.","November 25, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TE81","Kelli","So weird and wonderful.","This is a dress with a sense of humor for when you feel like being noticed. Pattern aside, it fit beautifully on my curves, the material was high quality and the whole dress felt expensive. I wore it to work, but I think it's intended for more formal occasions. Will rent again when the mood hits!","October 29, 2019","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TE81","Lisa e","Proportion better for a tall body - but very pretty","A great dress to make you feel and look like a professional adult, but not matronly or corporate. Beautiful print, high quality lines. But sizing was a bit difficult. The waist and hips fit me perfectly, snug like a glove. The top, however, was a bit roomy - it was either a bit too long or a bit too large or a bit of both. I think anyone who is small cheated or shorter (or both) would have this same fit issue, and because of how fitted the mid-section of the dress is, it can't simply hang lower to make up for it. I might try a size down if I rented again to see if the top would fit better but then the waist might be too tight - or I might try the size up so that it could hang lower and allow the length of the top to hang lower too but then maybe the whole thing would be too big. You seen the conundrum. Ultimately I think a more-padded bra made the top fit acceptably well.","August 29, 2019","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TE81","Victoria","Fun dress- but beware gloved hand pattern all over it","Comfortable easy to wear even though I needed a cami so that I didn't flash my bra - but it has gloved hands on the skirt and body (didn't worry me particularly but they are a bit odd). I sized up 2 sizes - May have got away with sizing up once but it was comfortable to walk and eat! I picked up the pink with shoes Nice vibrant colors on black satin finish heavier weight fabric.","August 11, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TE81","Bliss","Abracadabra! Great dress for a magic show.","Okay. So I got this dress and quickly realized it was NOT my steeze. It looks like something that you might wear to a magic show or if you were an accountant at the Bunny Ranch. The combination of arrows, shapes, black on black stripes, and strange lace Victorian gloves everywhere was a bit much. That said, I still wore it to work one day. Here's what I thought: 1. The slit under the pussy bow is very revealing. Even with the bow hanging down untied in the middle I'm pretty sure I flashed a lot of people. 2. The midsection of the dress has no structure and even though it's a looser fit, due to the fabric it is sort-of clingy. Not the MOST attractive. I like more structure in my waistline. 3. No one knew what to make of the dress so they just ignored it and didn't say anything. It's not that it's ugly per se...It's just really strange.","July 12, 2019","True to Size"

The length was perfect for dancing and jumping around at an outdoor wedding. Traveled well, without wrinkles on the train and in a car for a few hours. It was seriously stunning and my favorite RTR to wear, yet. Tied the neck ties in the back. Want to keep forever because it's so gorgeous, yet edgy. Will absolutely rent again in the future.","June 24, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TE81","Whitney","Gorgeous dress","The fabric is so unique and beautiful. And dress fits your body like a glove and flows beautifully. It does run fairly small I'm usually a size 6 normally, and wore for the 10 r, probably could have even gone one size up and had a little more room to breeze in the rib cage. At five or six, I loved the midi length, but a friend who is a little shorter did not like how long it was on her.","June 20, 2019","Wedding"

I wanted to look posh and feel comfortable - this dress did both these things for me! It was such a flattering cut and I adore the unique print. The neck tie can we worn multiple ways and I ended up tying it behind my neck to make my outfit look the way I wanted. The fabric is quite heavy and travels really well with no wrinkles! A win win.

Not only is the quality of the dress really wonderful (fabric, zippers, etc.) but the shape is flattering, forgiving AND form fitting. I wore the 16 R which is a US 12 and I loved the fit overall. I wish the top was a little tighter on me, but that would be my one complaint. I tied the neck tie in the back, rather than the front. The pattern was cute and was something different than the all black I usually wear. I'm pretty tall, and loved the length too.","April 19, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TE81","Emily","Elegant Perfection!","This dress is luscious top to bottom. The print is playful and unexpected and creates just gorgeous lines for your figure. Fitted through the bodice and waist and then more loosely falls along the bottom half. If you carry in your mid section I would recommend sizing up, no give to this glorious fabric. More cleavage than the model showed and could not wear for my intended work event, but luckily I had a more formal event I could transition it to because it would have been DEVASTATING to send back without wearing. Other dresses I've rented in this price point have never come close to feeling this lux, rent this if you want to feel like a million bucks!","February 3, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN19","Emily","Perfect black tie dress","I rented this for a black tie wedding in October. I wore a size 6R and it fit perfectly. I am barely 5'1"" and the dress hit the floor perfectly with 3inch heels. The front dips very low so if you're concerned about cleavage, this dress probably isn't for you. I used some fashion tap to keep the straps closer to my chest in case I bent over. The straps are very wide so I did pin them in a bit to make them more narrow. This dress was very form fitting but accentuates in all the right places.","October 30, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN19","Claudia","This dress was a hit.","If fit very well. Good stretchy material. No need to wear ""spanx"" underneath. It's very low cut but as long as the dress is tight enough it stays put. I got a lot of compliments!","October 23, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN19","Courtney","Head turning dress for a pregnant mama!","This dress fit like a glove. The heavy material was slightly stretchy but provided excellent structure to the gown and top. It stretched perfectly over my 14 week baby bump (third child so definitely showing). I'm a 34B/C and the top was not too big. I did use fashion tape to feel a bit more secure from gaping. My only con was that it was the perfect length barefoot (5'4""). I would have preferred it had been an inch or two longer for my heels.","October 20, 2019","Formal Affair"

It was easy to move in as well as comfortable indoors and outdoors. There is definitely a lot of cleavage shown with this dress-so if you are larger up top you have to be comfortable showing a little. I used fashion tape to make sure I didn't fall out the sides and pasties to use as a cover. Overall very cute dress and pretty function despite it being kind of revealing.","September 11, 2019","Wedding"

I am a size 34D and I had full coverage on the sides and felt very secure! Yes its a deep plunge but I really felt comfortable overall. I danced all night and nothing came out of place! lol The fabric was great and comfortable, I didn't need extra undergarments, it was really a solid dress to wear.","September 4, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN19","Jamie","The great dress!","I ordered two sizes: 12R and 10R as back up. I normally wear an 8/28 in denim. I first tried on the 12R and it felt good, but I noticed it was heavy. The material is very thick. I put the 10R to see the difference and wow what did it make. Because the material is thick it is best if the dress is snug. I went with the 10R, it felt great on all night. I really loved the dress. It is simple and a little risky with the deep V, but it's also elegant and a statement. The color of blue was beautiful and looked great with my partner's suit. The event was his holiday party, formal attire. This was my first time using Rent the Runway!","August 1, 2019","True to Size"

I am normally a 2 or 4 so ordered the 6 and 8. I probably could have went down a size for it to be tighter in the torso and waist areas, but some extra room for sitting and dancing never hurts. The deep V was sexy, but not overly revealing (34D w implants). I paired it with the Mika Lariat Set necklace from RTR and it looked so nice with it. I am only 5 feet tall and the dress JUST hit the floor with 3-4 inch heels, so I would definitely recommend getting the L if you are on the taller side.

It was so comfortable and the material was thick and had give, so I think it would compliment many body types. It fit true to size for me. The top was wide enough that I think it would cover most people. I could not wear a because it dipped too low, but I felt secure anyway.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN19","Lishaun","Definite show stopper..Got compliments all night!","The fit was great. Unfortunately I had more side boob than I had hoped, but some fashion tape solved that problem. It didn't move all night, with some light dancing. I wore 4"" heels, which I thought were too tall for the regular dress, I would order a long for those heels next time. It was definitely sexier than what I usually go for and I was worried it would be too much given my chest size (36DD). But it worked! At some point I just embraced the cleavage. It never killed anyone!! I gave it a 4 because the packaging was sloppy. I expected more from RTR. I've never seen such sloppiness with them before. The dresses came in a larger than necessary box thrown around the place. There were no directions or return shipping label. And someone had left an empty box of something in there (I can't remember if it was hosiery or not) but some item that shouldn't of been included was included.","January 29, 2019","True to Size"

My only caution with this dress is that the color may be faded.

Most things I get from RTR are unbelievably different in some way that always make me feel like a star- the style, the quality, the fit. This dress does not belong in that category. Much more of a blend-in-the-background type. I didn't love the color with the gold threads. It kind of looked tinsel-like and contrasting to me. Fit was great; maybe a little big in the chest, but that's not unusual for me. Overall, it matched the barn wedding I wore it to perfectly but is not something I'd order again.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP30","Maggie","Perfect for a wedding.","This dress was my first choice for my sister-in-law's wedding which was a very small, intimate affair (16 people) where even the guests were asked to wear wedding colors. Fortunately, this dress was well within the required color family. After reading previous reviews stating the the dress ran small, I decided to rent the medium (I'm usually a size 10 in dresses) and the large as a backup. The medium was a better fit. I will echo the other reviews that the zipper sticks at the center of the back, and fit is a little odd; it runs a little tight in the waist, and roomy in the bust. I did have to do a little smoothing and adjusting to get my 'girls' in position and to lay the upper fabric flat on the top of the chest and under the arms (you can see it in the photo). Despite all of the above it was quite comfortable, even after hours of eating an drinking, sitting, standing and moving I didn't have to pull or re-adjust it at all and it can be worn without a bra, though if I were to wear again, I would probably pad under the breasts. I would also note that the color is a little warmer than seen on the model, maybe closer to an apricot, especially with the gold accents on the lace. I styled it with simple gold and pearl jewelry and a pair of strappy block-healed shoes which were a fun white snake-skin with gold accents.","June 11, 2019","True to Size"

I was able to wear it without a bra, no problem. Never felt like I was going to give a free show, even when dancing around like a crazy person. The skirt was so much fun to dance with too, swishing it about to Beyonce and The Jonas Brothers. If I had to change something it would be the length. It did hit at a sort of awkward place on my leg for my height, but overall would highly recommend this dress for a beautiful spring wedding.","June 4, 2019","True to Size"

The color and detailing are GORGEOUS but I have a bit of a short torso and the V fell below where the bottom of my bra strap would normally land. Super inappropriate for a family affair. I loved it so much I was able to finagle the straps to be about half their length and wear it anyway. It is a beautiful color with great detailing but be aware the V!","June 4, 2019","Wedding"

I am 34A, 30 inch waist, 40 inch hips. Great dress! As others have said, it has gold detailing throughout that doesn't show in the photos. I wore it to a fancy awards dinner that wasn't formal / black tie, the event was a notch below that. Do they call that semi-formal? Anyway. The dress alone would have felt too wedding-y for me at this event, but I paired it with a leather motorcycle jacket and loved the soft + edgy combination.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR51","RTR Customer","Beautiful Color and Lace Detail","You definitely will want to size up for this blouse to feel comfortable. The lace is a tad itchy, especially under the arms. Also, long wasted girls beware, as it runs short. The other issue with the blouse is that the collar is a bit floppy and doesn't stay up. It's a minor issue, but one I want to point out, if that would be bothersome. But, all of that aside, it is a beautiful blouse! The color, lace detail, and opening in the back make this a fabulous/classy/sexy rental for a special occasion. I wore pasties because of the open detail in the back of the blouse.

It's work appropriate and still a bit edgy with the leather trim. The dress is thick and heavy - terrible for the heatwave we're currently in but perfect for a crisp fall day. Unfortunately, the leather trim is much tighter than the rest of the dress leaving me looking like I was bulging between leather stripes when really it was just the material bunching up. The leather trim around the hips hit me a bit too low and caused the dress to bunch up into a sort of muffin top. The arms are incredibly tight though I do play softball so maybe I just have larger arms? I couldn't reach up to put my hair into a ponytail. The worst part was the leather across the chest dug in so much that it gave me two boobs per side - half a boob above the leather and the other half below - and flattened me into an unflattering, lumpy, uniboob.","September 1, 2017","True to Size"

The only thing was on the 2r the chest area was not as fitted/tight as the 0r was so it didn't hold my boobs up very well (I wear a size 32/34 DD).

It also appeared in the picture to be tea length but given my short stature (5'4) it was awkwardly long and instead looked like i had a short long dress on. I felt like the dress was meant for a real-life Barbie that had a large chest, tiny tiny midline, and was very tall.

I received endless compliments and everyone wanted to know where I purchased the dress. I was happy to fill them in on all the joys of RTR. I've never rented from this designer previously, so not sure if it's common that the dresses run a little small. The black band at the waist was the tight spot, as it has no stretch. Everywhere else was flowy and lots of room. The upper part of the dress has padding, so if you did decide to go braless, the silky material isn't going to reveal everything! Only strange comment that was made to me over and over( besides it being the most lovely dress), was that from a distance, the lace on my arms, back and chest looked like tattoos.

I held it together with double stick tape. Oddly I had numerous people at the party approach me from across the room to tell me that they had mistaken the beautiful lace detail for tattoos.","December 18, 2019","Party"

The only things were that the black band around the rib cage was super tight, so if that isnt a slim area for you, size up. Also, as previous reviews mentioned, it didnt require a bra, but I was surprised at how much cleavage I had in it. I still ended up wearing the dress, but it was a little bustier than I would have thought/preferred. Overall, absolutely gorgeous dress I would 100% rent again.","October 3, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CD45","RTR Customer","Gorgeous dress that won't fit most people","This was a truly beautiful item. The color was gorgeous and the fabric and flow were great. However, I did not wear it due to sizing, and I suspect the fit of this will only work for a very few body shapes. As others noted, it runs tight at the waist, with no give or stretch. So I ordered one size up. Unfortunately, while it fit in the waist, it was way oversized and ill-fitted then on the top. The shoulders drooped, there were gaps at the armpit and cleavage lines, and the bust had a ton of extra material that made it look lumpy. Overall, maybe good for those with very large busts (I am DD, so I mean big) and broad shoulders to fill out the top.","May 13, 2019","True to Size"

The fit around the bodice was a bit snug, but hiking up the blouse a bit alleviated the tightness. I'm fairly thin up top, so this may just be an issue of a narrow cut. I paired this with burnished gold jewelry, and wore a black cami underneath since some said that the dress might be a bit revealing.

The bottom was a good snug fit, and my only comment is that the slit does come up pretty far. I ended up wearing some shorts underneath just in case.

The vertical floral pattern is super flattering and there's a tiny bit of stretch in the material that made it super comfortable. The neckline is gorgeous and worth the spanx!","October 3, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BH43","Jessica","Sexy vintage dress","I ordered a 6 and the 8 wasn't available for a free backup size -- I probably would've worn the 8 if I had the choice, but the 6 worked out. I have a smaller waist and this was still snug through the tummy on me, but once it was zipped up I was good to go. It was hard to get zipped all the way up alone, so you'll need some help. The neckline is beautiful and makes the dress! It can be somewhat revealing but I was comfortable and secure in it. Didn't have to wear a bra which was a bonus! I wore this to a Mad Men themed party and felt like it fit perfectly. It was fun to wear!","September 26, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BH43","Shannon","Such a fun dress!","Weighing in at 150lbs and a 36D, this dress was a little boobalicious but definitely doable and so cute! I loved having the straps up a little higher like shown in the photo. PSA, when sitting that slit is a little uncomfortable for a church ceremony unless you have something to cover it with. I listened to the other reviews and made sure to tape down the hangar straps in front and back, definitely gave me some peace of mind. Overall great, comfy dress that I was able to dance all night in and not have to wear Spanx.","September 2, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BH43","Rachel","Got compliments from groomsmen to little old ladies!","Pros: Sexy and classic. The dress has a little stretch and the straps are elastic so the dress stays in place all night. No worrying about adjusting or pulling it up. Cons: I have a pear shape and this dress would be more flattering on someone with more bust and less thigh. This dress is all about the girls! It also has a significant slit so while it fit standing, when I sat down I showed a lot of leg.","August 25, 2019","True to Size"

I went with an XS for this one because I felt like the dress was a bit too long on me and the XS was tighter on my shoulders, providing more security in my bust (I knew I would be doing a lot of dancing that night, and I don't wear strapless bras too often). It ended up being just a bit too snug because of my curves, but I felt confident and sexy nonetheless. I received a ton of compliments! I highly recommend this dress!","August 13, 2019","Large"

I would ABSOLUTELY order a back up size, just to be safe!","July 31, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BH43","Tiffany","Extremely flattering, but needed corset.","This dress is so beautiful! I went a size up and got a 12 and it was perfect. The top is really sexy and the overall vibe is very classic, sexy and a bit pin-up. It's fitted throughout though and I'm a bit curvy so I had a friend lace me into a corset for a flatter stomach appearance and it made the whole look perfection. Received endless compliments. Love it! Would rent again!","July 27, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BH43","Stafford","Stood out in a sea of black, thought I might fall out of the top the whole night.","I really liked this dress but it is very low cut. I was worrying I'd flash someone the whole night, especially sitting down or leaning over. Also, it made me look oddly flat chested (I'm a D) which I don't mind too much but found strange. I did not wear a bra (it would have showed) and I didn't feel that I needed one. Otherwise, the dress is comfortable and the slit is not too high, but I wouldn't recommend this dress for the well endowed. Also, no dancing at the event to which I wore this, but this dress would be a nightmare for dancing.","July 20, 2019","Formal Affair"

I love low necklines, but did safety-pin the neckline to keep it in place a little. It was definitely shorter in the back than expected- a combo of the fun asymmetrical hem and my big butt lol.

It would be great for a ""full bust"" figure, as it's huge on top and fitted through the waist and hips (but not tight). However, I'm a pear and it still feels and looks great. The lining is so soft and comfortable. The shortest part of the dress is just above the knee, as pictured on the model. If you have broad shoulders, you're in luck, but if you're small, the sleeves will be very long on you. I'm 5'9"" and they fall halfway past my fingertips. There is plenty of room in the elastic waist. I wore it with a turquoise cami to make it work appropriate in the back, as the slit drapes quite a bit and really exposes your back.","October 4, 2018","Work"

I really wish this dress was a racer back because it's so low cut, I had to keep fidgeting with the dress all night. It was pretty bump friendly, I wore it at 18 weeks and it fit just perfect on my rib cage","February 9, 2020","Wedding"

Well it was long but that's my fault because I'm only 5' tall but with high heels it just missed the floor. The fabric is beautiful and thick enough to give good shape without overdoing it. I ended up wearing my backup dress because this was a little too fancy for my actual event (work holiday party) but I would definitely wear it for something a little more formal. Also it has pockets that you can't tell are there which is always a bonus.","December 17, 2019","Formal Affair"

I was debating between the 6 and the 4 due to a few extra summer pounds around the belly but the 4 fit perfectly. The straps are a little longer than I would have liked and with the low back, I wasn’t able to wear a real bra.

The pockets are always the best part! I felt it was a good material and although the material was quality/think it did not feel heavy. My only complaint is the same as every other review for this dress: The straps are way too long and it causes issues particularly with a large chest. Because it was loose the girls were definitely going to fall out and wearing a bra with the low cut was not an option (double whammy) so I wish they had been adjustable. We had tried to pin them and when that didn't work (the pins would pop open). We used some thread to get them to cinch in the back. I probably wouldn't rent this one again, but it was pretty and received many compliments. It was also easy to dance in. I would have liked a little more leg to show (for my own preference since it is my only/best asset), but the little peek that it had was nice as is too. For info I have been described as an inverted triangle/top heavy. I call myself apple shape, my friends say inverted triangle. So use that info how you will!","September 9, 2019","True to Size"

Just like everyone else mentions, the straps are long and need to be tied in the back but a simple safety pin and some fashion tape was all I needed. I would warn those with larger breasts to be cautious though, it is quite low cut! The pockets were perfection and I felt classier than I've ever felt before in my life. I would own this dress if I could!","June 21, 2019","True to Size"

Very flattering on small chested/waisted ladies. Definitely loved the pockets too! Paired nicely with black/navy and silver or gold accessories. Only complaint is the breast area lacks structure. Would be great to have a thin breast shaper in there. Also, the straps are quite long as other reviewers mentioned.","June 12, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM480","Emily","Great dress, long straps though!","I got tons of compliments on this dress and felt so great wearing it! I found it to be very flattering. As other reviewers said, the straps are very long. In order to make it fit properly, I had to secure the straps together in the back (so they were more crisscrossed) with some black fabric that I tied into a knot. It was a bit noticeable in the back but not too bad. I'm 5'1"" and the dress did trail on the ground in the back, but since it was a high low bottom it worked. I'm in between a size 10 and 12, and I probably could have made either size work, but the 12 was very comfortable on. Due to the straps, I probably wouldn't rent again unless I was already prepared with something to keep the straps together that was a bit more sophisticated than what I did at the last minute. The dress does definitely show some cleavage, but because of the full length I thought it was tasteful.","June 3, 2019","Wedding"

I bought a heart shaped strap shortener to hold the straps together in the back forming a X after I read other reviews saying that is what they did to fix the problem.

I did not have an issue with the straps being too long as described by others, but as the night went on, I felt like they stretched out a little and I kept pulling them up.

The only thing I didn't like is that the tightest part of the dress hit slightly above my natural waist because I had to tighten the straps. so I had to wear the size up because my ribs are wider than my waist.

While it did ""fit"" on top (still a bit tight with a bra), the bottom made me feel incredibly self conscious of any belly that I might have. I wore Spanx which helped but, again, not super comfortable. Reformation is definitely a narrow-fitting brand so if you have even the slightest notion that you may need more room on bottom than top, size up an extra size. Also, the wrinkling of this fabric was not ideal. If ever chose to rent Reformation again, I will size up to an 8 and go with a patterned fabric to remedy those two main issues.","September 11, 2019","Small"

It was also much tighter in the waist than anticipated so that picture you see is with spanx (they will show through the side slit, but just roll the one leg) I would say it runs small due to how it fits at the waist. The length was great, the fabric was great, everything was great. My only issues were the tightness and that the straps couldn't really get to a comfortable fit, but it ended up fine. I wore them with some Chinese Laundry nude wedges.","September 2, 2019","Small"

I normally wear a size 8 pants and non-gown dress. I got the 10 to be safe as I didn't have a backup. Due to the elastic in the back, I think I could have also worn the 8, but I was really happy with the way the 10 wore as well.","August 10, 2019","True to Size"

It doesn't get five stars because it was thin and not overly forgiving, it wrinkled easily, and even though I wanted to go bra-less, the fabric showed everything and I needed a sticky bra just to protect in case of cold weather. But it was such a knockout that my boyfriend talked about buying it for me if I find an occasion to wear it again. Also, runs a little small.

I usually wear a 4 or 6 in dresses and for this, I wore a 4, but a 6 would probably have fit better since the dress runs a tad small. I wore nude Spanx underneath because the torso is snug and it shows every little curve and dimple (make sure to get Spanx that end high up on your leg because of the slit). The straps are adjustable and I didn't have to wear a bra with it, which I love! The upper back part has a stretchy section, but that's the only part of the dress with any give/stretch to it.

It had a thick material that honestly reminded me of scuba gear, but that helped it glow over any imperfections and keep everything tucked in. I might have gone down a size had I know the material was so forgiving, but overall it was very comfy and a pretty, simply black dress.

It is conservative enough to wear around colleagues yet it's still formfitting and sexy. I liked the dress because it was a very thick stretchy fabric. It held you in and hugged your body. The high-low was a nice feature. The cons are that it ran big. I am a true size 6 and it was definitely big on me and the four would have been better. Also, the neckline rides up and you have to pull it down throughout the night and keep folding it over. If you want a safe option this would be a great dress.","March 4, 2019","Formal Affair"

I am 5'2"" and was not going to wear tall heels (these are very short heels). It is snug around my baby bump but not to the point where you can't breath or uncomfortable for the baby. Easily can sit down in it. Black is always flattering and received so many compliments. With this baby weight, I was about 150 lbs. I also didn't wear a bra.

The dress hugs all the right curves and isn't too long for short girls like me (5'2). The ruffles are flattering and despite it being slightly stretched at the top I didn't have any problems with the dress slipping down. The color is just beautiful too to couple with some jewelry I've had forever and some Louboutins for a country club rehearsal dinner.","August 13, 2019","Wedding"

It was the right type of snug though, sucked me in and didn't feel like it was going to fall down while dancing. The material is really nice and kept me warm when the temperature started to cool off near the end of the night. The color of the dress is beautiful-deep forestry green.

The color was very dark green and very dramatic. I wasn't sure if this dress would be flattering and then I put it on and it looked great. True to other reviews it smoothed out my stomach nicely, but still gave my hips and butt dancing room (dancing is very important) The one thing I didn't love about this dress was that because it was strapless, I did have to hike it up several times throughout the night, this is less about the dress and more a general complaint to the universe about the incompatibility of big boobs and strapless dresses.","March 27, 2019","True to Size"

The tea length was perfect for a black tie-optional event (where I didn't want to go floor length, but knee length seemed inappropriate). As other reviews have mentioned, the color is very close to black but still quite attractive. My only caution is that the dress is not designed for smaller chested consumers like myself. The dress still stayed up because of a thin rubber lining, which was great, but it did stress me out a bit throughout the night. Overall I'd definitely wear it again.","March 5, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMU64","Jennifer","A little snug, but tons of compliments!","I was worried when I tried this dress on because the medium was snug from the waist down and the large was loose from the waist up. I ended up going with the 8 and let my Spanx work their magic! I ended up receiving TONS of compliments all night! I loved the beautiful deep green color -- like a LBD but with a twist. This dress is perfect for an hourglass shape, but just be mindful that if you are too bottom-heavy you could run into the same problem as I did. There is no give whatsoever, so if I were an inch wider at the hips I would have been out of luck. Overall, such a beautiful dress!","February 6, 2019","True to Size"

The ribs in the sides of the dress were great, hugging me almost like a comfortable bodice. The only con I noticed is the zipper on the dress is extremely long, so if I had it unzipped to the bottom, I actually couldn't get it to stay up around my hips in order to zip it up. I left it about one quarter zipped up to step into it and was able to get it the rest of the way afterwards on my own.","November 23, 2018","True to Size"

It does run long, so if you're short like me, keep that fashion tape handy, or go with the XSP if available.

I wore 3 inch heels and that was perfect to where the dress didn't drag on the floor. I am a D cup and surprisingly enough, I didn't wear a bra with this dress. The dramatic shoulder was a show stopper and I wore big statement earrings to complete the look. The ruching on the top of the dress camouflaged all of that! The only CON is that the dress was shifting a little bit, but I think my shaper was to blame for that. Other than that, I highly recommend this dress.","November 18, 2019","True to Size"

No stretch but you can adjust strap length to get the fit you want in front, and that also changes where it hits in back. It is VERY backless, I didn't need any fashion tape but did wear an invisible sticky bra. I'm 5'2"" and it was floor length at the longest point with 4 inch heels.","May 13, 2019","Wedding"

The cut was incredibly flattering, and the adjustable straps allow for you to make it as modest (or not) as you want. Despite a completely open back, the rest of the dress is cut in a way that it isn't too revealing overall. She said she would've bought it if she could have!

Due to being backless, you cannot wear a bra but I did not have any issues or slip-ups; had it been looser on the side then tape would have probably been useful. I will say that for a wedding, it was a bit risky (high slit, backless, and some side exposure on the bust) so just be sure to know the formality level of the wedding, audience, etc. I received a ton of compliments on the dress though and would 100% wear it again.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN137","Denise","This was a Show Stopper Dress !","This Dress was amazing and I felt very Glamorous in it. Fit was true to size but under sheath does not stretch at all. Wore a nude strapless bra . Gave 4 star due to it being itchy in the neck area . Received tons of compliments at the Wedding Ceremony and the Reception. My sister-in-law even asked if she could borrow it and then I revealed where I got it from! So glad I rented it since this is a once only dress due to everyone would remember this if you ever wore it again . Gold jewelry and heels complimented it very well .","February 20, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN137","Christine","Gorgeous, but best for women with short torso and flatter chest. Very scratchy :-(","The color and embroidery of this dress is absolutely gorgeous, but I am bummed that I could not wear this dress for the following reasons: * the material around the neck and armholes (and waist) is super scratchy (and I am usually not one who is bothered by materials that other reviewers describe as scratchy); no way that I could wear this for many hours; * the material going all the way up the neck and the embroidery at the chest makes one look even chestier (not good for someone already well endowed) and the waist of the dress falls about 1 inch above my natural waist --> this dress made me look like a box; I think this dress would be amazing on a flatter-chested woman with a short torso. In terms of sizing, I was surprised to read reviews that thought this dress ran large. If anything, I think it runs small at the hips and thighs. I am a 10 at the chest and 8 at the waist and hips (5'8""; 156 lbs, 36C). This dress in size 10 fit perfectly on top and tight at the hips and thighs (it's the double lining that fits tight, not the actual dress material). It's possible that the lining has shrunk from all the dry cleaning, making the fit tighter than it was when new.","January 30, 2019","Small"

It fits a little loose around the stomach, a problem I have with most of my dresses, but the lace overlay didn't make it obvious. The hips and chest were just right. Bra or no bra doesn't matter! Came to my ankles, but a lot of shoes work with this dress. Gorgeous colors, a lot of compliments.

SUCH a huge fan of this dress and so stunned by how gorgeous and brilliantly colored this is in person. Do note that the slip does go low in the back and it was too low in front for my nude bras, but SHOCKINGLY, my red bra with straps was perfect and totally unnoticeable (see close-up pics--you can hardly see it, even in person!). Was easy enough to zip up and even button (3 at the neck) and was comfortable all night. Got TONS of compliments :)","June 28, 2018","Formal Affair"

Straps were way too long (wear something over it!) Really pleased with how the dress hung and the feel of the fabric. The shoulder straps were so long- I pinned them over and the chest still fell so low. The top part of my bra cups kept showing by the armpits. I layered with a leather jacket and then with a sweater- both worked well, pretty versatile piece.","August 8, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DL180","Lindsay","More shimmery than expected, so not for work but great for date night","I was originally thinking of wearing this for work, but the material is quite shimmery, so better for a date night. I didn't find the straps too long like some other reviewers, but they are in a position that is unlikely to perfectly align with your standard bra straps. So if you rent, be prepared to go with a strapless bra, or have a plan to style it with a jacket or sweater or something. I wish I had a white jean jacket, but I made do with a white button down shirt, and I paired with some fun Cole Haan sneakers that have silver flowers to give it a casual summer date vibe.","July 27, 2019","Date"

Yeah, it sparkles a bit so you gotta be up for that.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DL180","Monica","Shiny, thick, luxurious, well constructed","I rented this for a sunny vacation. It was a bit ""fancy"", but I tend to over-dress, I loved it! The fabric is definitely a shiny, silver color. The material is thick and a bit raspy, my two year old didn't like it haha! The scratchy feel did not bother my body as I wore it. I read the other reviews about the long straps after I wore the dress. I was surprised to read the comments because I did not have that problem. As a point of reference, I have a short torso, height is 5.2-5.3ish. The dress was long on me, calf length. I wore a strapless bra and the fit was great. The pleats in the dress are so well constructed, they make the dress ""luxe"". Since the material is thick, it hugs the curves and it's forgiving at the same time. Since I am petite and have a short torso, I wore a thin belt to accentuate my waist. Without the belt, the natural waist of the dress would not have looked as flattering for my height. Overall, I loved the dress! I definitely would recommend it.","February 28, 2019","Vacation"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JCR54","Ashton","I wore this dress to a wedding and it worked out perfectly!","The dress was absolutely stunning the second I put it on. The 4R fit like a glove and was the perfect length for me with 2-3 inch heels. It runs true to size, but there is no give in the dress. The emerald with black lace detailing is so elegant, and even though the dress feels very expensive it felt very light on. I'm sure you could wear a regular strapless bra, but I wore a sticky bra and it worked out great. I did typical wedding things (sit, eat, dance etc.) in it and it didn't feel restrictive at all and had great movement when dancing. The only suggestion I have is if you are on the shorter side like me, be careful about the lace trim on the bottom of the dress. I held my dress up a bit when I walked to avoid snagging it. The dress fit floor length on me (I'm 5'2""). If you're on the taller side, this shouldn't be an issue for you.

The waist drops slightly, so it's very flattering. I'm only 5'3"" and without heels, the lace in the back would have hung on the ground, so shorter women, plan accordingly!

I almost wore it backwards because I was worried about pulling off such a deep neckline, but using petals and fashion tap made me feel a lot more tucked in.

I’m 5’3” and usually wear a size 8 (pre-pregnancy). I ordered both the M and L in this dress, but wound up wearing the M. You’ll want to wear pantyhose or spanx underneath, as the dress clings and shows lines. However, I felt lovely and received many compliments on the look.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP1","Dana","Classy!","This dress is classy and complimentary but it wasn't my favorite. I wore the size 0 and it still was a little lose at the top. I have a small rib cage and need a strapless dress to be pretty snug. I think this dress is true to size but the fabric is stretchy and that's why I had a problem with it. I put fashion tape at the top to keep it in place but the fabric was so heavy that it kept pulling on it which made the tape uncomfortable. Also, the boning on the top was poking through on the inside of the dress. I put 2 bandaids over it and that did the trick! Overall, I like how I looked in the dress I just didn't like how I felt in it. I think it would be perfect if you have a fuller figure. I'm pretty straight and narrow.","August 26, 2018","Large"

The only complaint was the boning on the left side of dress was poking out a little and stuck me in the side. Easy fix was 2 band aids over it and voila fixed.

I have a larger butt proportionally but the underskirt had no room to budge. Size 2: The bust was huge! Any movement caused my bra to show and there was extra fabric in the armpit.

Tried each on each day leading up to the event and while the 0 for me better, the 2 had more fabric and with it being winter I thought I would be more comfortable if I was able to cover up some. As you can see in the picture, it was big enough to hide the high/low aspect completely. If I had worn the 0 that would not have been the case.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CMO29","Cierra","Fun and flirty dress!","I rented this dress to wear to a cocktail gala and was very happy with my choice! Pros: The color and print really stood out and I loved the ruffles! I got a lot of compliments throughout the night. As for the fit, the dress fit true to size, comfortable to wear, and the material was a very good quality. The slit comes open when you sit, but it didn't bother me too much. Cons: No cons for the dress, but I had a hard time getting in touch with customer service once I received my dress. The ruffle on the arms seemed to be stretched out by previous wearers and fell down much further than it should. I tried to contact RTR by phone to order a replacement but was unable to get in touch with anyone. I also emailed but never received a response. Since it was the day before my event, I had to temporarily tack the ruffles in place so I could wear the dress. This was my first order and I was overall very pleased. I would definitely reorder again but add an additional day on the front end to account for unforeseen problems.","June 4, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CMO29","Megan","Unique and fun but weird sizing...","I loved this dress but the fit was just weird... I ordered a medium and a large. The medium fit but in the hip/butt/leg area it was tight which made the fabric pull and bunch in weird places. Since there was a slit this also made the slit pull which left me a little overexposed. I ended up wearing the large but the large had excess fabric in the butt/hips area and was a little baggier than I would have liked. I was probably just in between sizes, but since there was little to no ""give"" in the fabric I just couldn't get away with the medium. Also beware: if you are wearing this to a summer wedding, the fabric is VERY heavy. All in all I got a lot of compliments and the dress is very cool, just beware if you're a larger bottomed girl like myself :)","May 28, 2019","Wedding"

The quality is amazing and felt great as soon as I put it on. Chest area ran a bit large, but the ruffles hide everything. Color is blush, not white with the print. As other reviewers noted, sitting presents a bit of an issue with having to drape the dress over your legs. Aside from that, I have no complaints about this dress! I would rent again!","May 24, 2019","Large"

The L was too loose and made me look frumpy. But the M was too tight in the hips which made the front gap open which would've worked if I was wearing it a night out or something but it's not what I wanted for my engagement pictures.

The material is very heavy an no super breathable so cooler nights are best if you get hot easily. It doesn't tuck into jeans but a side french tuck looked cute!

I'm a 14 and I wore the 3X. It was roomy but comfortable, the 2X probably would have been good. These are Australian sizes so the scale is different. The dress is beautiful and breezy with vibrant colors and fun ruffles. I wore it with gold flats to work and with flatforms sandals to dinner one night. Can easily be dressed up or down. The neckline was far too plunging even for my C cups but I was easily able to safety pin. Beautiful!","June 6, 2019","Everyday"

I am a size 4Long so I ordered the 40L and it could not have fit any better! It was my first time using RTR and I was not disappointed! Bust: I am a 36C (recently down from a 36D) so I often worry about popping out or having major saggy boob, so I have to wear sticky pads or some other creative means of bust control. This dress has a built in bra which was AMAZING. Usually ""built in bras"" do very little to fight gravity for anything over a B cup. This built in bra kept everything in and up securely. I moved comfortably and confidently. No need to adjust, no worrying about certain movements causing things to shift. It was great! Very well designed. Length: I am 5'10. When I first tried this dress without shoes, it rested on the floor. I was able to wear a 1"" heal with it. I would have preferred the option to have a higher heal, but it worked well. Fit: This dress is stretchy and form fitting. I moved comfortably and did not feel the need to suck the tummy in after eating or drinking. One thing I would mention - this dress is easier to get on than it is to get off. There is no sexy way to do it so be forewarned! Over all it is a beautiful dress and I was very happy!

I stand 5'7"" which makes jumpsuits a gamble re; length as in flats the Regular was great (I did trip a couple of times in the wide-legs but I'm generally clumsy, so take that with a grain of salt) but felt that I could have used an additional 1/2-1 inch more to wear the taller heel as I'd planned.

This dress is super comfortable and retro, reminded me of the '50s. The skirt is very full, the fabric is light and soft. It's such a fun dress to wear! I would have bought it if it wasn't so expensive. You can wear a regular bra with it. The straps did fall off my shoulders at times, they're a little long. I wore ballet flats with it for practical purposes, but is is absolutely banging with heels! I loved the pockets, they're deep enough that I was able to keep my I-phone, lipstick, and glasses in them (and didn't need to carry a handbag). This dress looks much better in person than it does in this photograph, extremely flattering and makes your waist look tiny.

Cotton frock has no stretch in fabric, although construction at back is highly elastic. Pros: loved the print and colors, bright yellow is my absolute favorite thing right now! The silhouette was very mad men/1950/1960s which was flattering if a bit much. Pull ring on zipper was clutch. Cons: mine came damaged with a safety pin situation that had been missed in cleaning - that always makes me wonder what's up with quality control. Shoulder straps were a little loose on me AND for a dress of this quality I was surprised the designer did not build in bra carriers. I styled for work with black suede and mesh pumps, a black bolero when it got chilly from AC and giant yellow rented earrings; for play I swapped pumps for sneakers and lost the sweater.","July 25, 2018","Work"

I don't usually look like I have much good, but this dress did that for me. It's right mostly around the knees and chest area so it limits how much you can move your legs apart. If I got any bigger of a size I don't think it would've fit right. I received so many compliments on this dress and the color was beautiful. Would recommend true to size or one size up depending on your body type.","October 28, 2019","Wedding"

I found the fabric very nice and high end, but doesn't have a lot of give to it. I would definitely size up if you are curvy. Overall I felt good and got a lot of compliments, but I would have probably picked something else that breathes more for a summer wedding. The top is good if you have a larger bust as it's not overly revealing and holds everything in. The length is nice if you are tall. I'm 5'9"" and it was a good 3/4 length on me. I wouldn't order if you are short though.","July 21, 2019","Wedding"

I ended up wearing it on vacay and then a few times once I got home, including our 4th of July party! Was definitely a winner that I'd rent again.

The lace is stretchy yet tough and holds you in place and it was perfect for dancing -- moved easily and I didn't have to worry about busting out anywhere because I was held into the dress securely.

I am also a little short (5'3"") so it fell right above the ankles - I think it would have looked even better had I worn taller heels. There is not much ""give"" around the bottom of the dress so walking up stairs was a challenge.

I’m a 36DDD so the 12 fit my chest perfectly, it could have been more form fitting in the waist and hips if I had sized down but perhaps that would have compromised the fit around my bust.

It fit super well BUT: if you are not gifted up top, you might need some help. I stuffed my fiancé's socks in my bra hahaha. And, you might need help in the bathroom. If you have hips or a butt or both, this dress ain't coming up over them so you have to take it all the way off. Going up stairs was challenging because the dress is very fitted through the legs and don't expect to take long strides. Walking slower gives people extra time to eye you up and wish they had rented this dress too. :)","February 12, 2019","Formal Affair"

I got compliments throughout the night but it was somewhat difficult to walk in and stairs were particularly challenging.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS57","RTR Customer","Beware of stairs","It was a beautiful dress... very tight!! I was swimming in the 6R, and felt snug in the 4R which I ended up wearing (5'6"", 125, 32dd). You have to completely strip to use the restroom... I assumed other reviews were exaggerating, but they weren't! Not the worst thing I've ever had to do to wear a pretty dress. However, waddling up stairs / tackling them sideways is a bit embarrassing if you're unprepared. Eventually I learned to pull it up a bit to give my knees more room, then do stairs, then readjust. Overall a pretty dress and a lot of compliments, but I probably wouldn't get again. I like to dance freely!!","November 19, 2018","Wedding"

I go to 10-15 formal events every year, and this was hands-down the most complimented dress I've ever worn. The sequins really are exquisite, and they stood out, even in a sea of 80s extravagance. The fit and fabric is just perfect--there's enough give to fit many figures, and the sequins smooth everything out and hide any flaw. I have a thicker midsection and heavier arms, and neither was an issue at all in terms of fit. The dress was super flattering! It's on the shorter side, which I like, but it might not be for you if you're tall and prefer something closer to knee-length. I'm also a true 12 and was glad I had the 14.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NMK20","Marylee","Perfect New Years Eve dress!!","Some backstory: I got this a few months ago through Unlimited just to try it on as my month was ending and I felt like trying on something outrageously fancy and I didn't plan on continuing my subscription. I loved it so much, I re-upped for Unlimited (since the cost of that was cheaper than renting it for one weekend) and as soon as this dress became available again I snatched it up! I think it was hanging in my closet, taking up a slot, for over a month before New Year's but it was 100% worth it. The array of colors on this dress made me feel like I was wearing dragon scales (so. freaking. cool.) I got complimented left and right all night. The fit was perfect, it was tight, and I'm self conscious, but the dress is so thick that it didn't feel like it was clinging to every bump, instead it was like a sheet or armor, grazing my curves in the best way. Speaking of armor, the dress is heavy, and very warm. Which works for New Years Eve but not so much for a June gala if you get me. Also, it is very short, especially when you sit down, so keep that in mind (I love showing off my legs :P ). I fit anywhere from a 14-18 depending on the designer and material and this was a perfect fit at 18, my huge boobs did not feel squished at all. Highly recommend for a night when you want to make a crazy impression. A+","January 3, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NMK20","Maureen","Dazzling! Tons of compliments! Thank you, RTR!","This is the most gorgeous dress! The sequins change color depending as you run your ha hand over them, from a rich coral to deep royal blue with gold interspersed. It is so comfortable, with a black lining throughout, no scratchiness whatsoever. I wore it both with and without a bra, as the bust is fitted in a nice way. I went to three different parties and even strangers stopped to comment on my beautiful dress. It may be a little short for some, but since it is basically a full cover up otherwise, it was just right for my events, one of which was a law firm holiday dinner. My measurements are 42-31-36 and it was not clingy at the waist, which I appreciated. Thank you RTR for this fabulous dress! I am wearing it a couple more times with completely different crowds and events, so after about four or five wearings on my unlimited membership, will happily send it back and enjoy the memories. And the photos!","December 22, 2018","Party"

It was a little bit of a pain to wear on a breezy day, but was long enough to wear with confidence through airport security screening.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA337","Veronica","The event was just a Gatsby-themed Christmas party. :-)","This dress is a good option for ""flirty"" and feminine look. It is flattering in many ways, although for some bodies and styles, it might not be the ideal look. What I loved about the dress was that it was in good condition and looked crisp/fresh. It didn't have any telltale signs of being a ""rental"", which concerned me after seeing other dresses on this site being reviewed as clearly worn or having been exposed to repeated dry cleanings. It wasn't fussy or difficult to wear - in fact, the blouson feature can camouflage any bloating or stomach concerns. But at the same time, it can add a little bulk when you may prefer a more fitted look. That is the style of this dress, so it's not a flaw. Overall, this would be good if you: - like your upper arms and shoulders; - don't intend to show off your six-pack (it hides your abs, for better or worse); - like softer colors, and don't want to make a big color ""splash"". My concern about RTR: I dislike the way the dresses are sent; they are sent in a garment bag that is mailed straight in the post, without any sort of box or protective plastic outer wrap. This results in a really dirty garment bag. Even though the garment is protected inside, that bag has been in many hands, and it seems unhygienic to put it on top of your bed or couch, etc. That specific detail surprised me. Seeing the garment bag lying on my doorstep, which could have had rain, bugs, etc - was gross to me.","December 31, 2018","True to Size"

However, I didn't love it as much in person. The neckline and hem are gorgeous. But it was a lot of extra fabric around the middle. The model in the pic is tall so it lays better. I had to pull the elastic up so it would sit on my actual waist and it looked different. I loved the shorter length. I feel like the skirt was short and the body was long. I didn't hate it, but it could have been better. Bonus- it doesn't wrinkle AT ALL.

I didn't love it when I first saw it, as I thought the grommets were more silvery; they're more of a bronze/gold and I usually avoid those tones due to having mostly silvery jewelry and bags (chains and detail on the bags). That said, I wore it to work and got TONS of compliments! It should be clear but keep in mind that there is no lining so you definitely need to wear a slip and/or cami underneath for more professional settings.

To me, the texture reminded me of carpet or maybe the kind of fabric you'd find on a couch. Either way, I was very happy with this dress. It felt special without being too fancy to wear to work: the fit and flare style is super cute and flattering and the fabric looks high quality. The grommets, though see-through, didn't strike me as a problem. I just wore a nude bra and underwear and I think it looked fine.","May 15, 2019","Work"

I wish the straps were adjustable, because that was my main gripe with the dress, it just hung a little too low (definitely emphasized my assets tho).

The material is soft and forgiving. I wore spanx to smooth out the bumps and loved how the dress hugged my curves. The neckline was not too conservative but also not too low, and the shape of the straps meant I could wear a regular bra. The ruffle and ruching were ideally placed to add detail without adding bulk.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BH84","Jess","Amazing customer service and dress","So happy to be one of the first to review this dress! I was in a bit of a panic after my dress and backup dress both didn't work. I contacted RTR and a stylist stayed with me on the phone while we worked together to pick out different styles. She suggested this one for me and really saved the day. As a bonus, this was a brand new dress so the tags were still on! This dress is sophisticated and classy and went amazing with my accessories. I'm 5'3"", 145-150, 34C and curvy. This dress is perfect for someone who's short and curvy as it wasn't too long and was very flattering on the body. If you're taller it might not be long enough for you. The fabric is stretchy yet structured and I was able to comfortably move and eat all night. The frill on the bottom was also very fun. Compared to other size 6 dresses I've tried, this one could potentially run true to size or a little large. If you're not curvy, you may need to size down. Truly was sad to send this one back and will consider purchasing. Thank you so much RTR for great customer service and choosing a great dress for me!","May 3, 2019","True to Size"

I'm a 34C with 27 inch waist and the size 2 fit fine except that I needed to have 2 more inches in my torso. I'm 5'4"" and this dress is made for someone with a longer torso. My legs are long so the length of the skirt looked fine, just below my knees. I could see this looking really good on someone taller. You could get away with not wearing a bra because the way the top criss-crosses in the front acts like a bra and hold you in. I also wish the full flouncy skirt had pockets. I had to return this one without wearing.","June 6, 2019","Wedding"

The sleeves were billowy and pretty, and the zipper is long enough to make changing in/out of it really easy! Lace wasn't scratchy, which is usually my aversion to lace pieces. I felt super cute while also feeling like a grown-up. ;) Would definitely recommend, especially for ""apple"" ladies who are looking for some forgiveness in the waistline. Just know that the bandeau under the lace only goes across the chest area, and may not give bigger-busted ladies the coverage they'd like.

The heavy knit fabric allowed for stretch while still running true to size, and I would recommend sizing up for backup if you want a less fitted look. This top is more metallic in person, however I loved how sparkly it was and loved cool this sweater made me feel! There was comfortable room in the bust due to the stretch of the fabric, however this sweater should definitely be worn with a strapless bra, as the bra strap would be visible in the slit above your bust. I loved the turtleneck and how this piece defined my waist. I couldn’t wait to wear it after work for dinner and drinks with my friends!

I was able to get it on and off alone, which is nice. The material wrinkles easily. The fit was perfect for me. I am a 10/12, and the 12 fit perfectly. I followed the reviews that it ran a bit small. Jcrew generally runs small, so I normally get 12s from there and this was no different. I had a jean jacket on most of the day since it was cooler, but the cut really shows off the shoulders so if that is something you want to flaunt, this is perfect for you. The jacket kind of killed the look. I paired it with some white wedge sandals and loved the whole look. There were a few stains on the legs, but that was my only issue with this price. I may keep it to wear to a party this weekend.","September 17, 2019","Everyday"

The only small con was that it was very, very short, so had to wear shorts under the dress. Given it was winter, it was actually warmer so not that much of a con. Would highly recommend this dress.","January 3, 2020","True to Size"

Put your arms through the holes in that fabric so that the clasp part that looks like a bra strap is clasped on the side of your body and not in the back. Pull the front part of the Dress up and tie the top strings up behind your neck, positioning the capelet over your shoulders. Then tie the second lot of strings together in the back.

The hook and eyes are easier with a partner, but I was able to fasten on my own with a little bit of work. I planned to rent this for a white boat party, but after reading a review that stated it could be dressed up, I rented it for a theater outing.

It is very complex to put on and you will need someone to help you, but once you get it figured out, it's comfortable and feels very secure. It's hard to tell from pictures, but there's fabric that goes across the chest, so there's no risk of under-boob. You can't wear a bra with this dress and there is no padding in the chest, so I would say pasties are necessary. The material is very substantial and not at all see-through - more of a heavy, formal material than a casual, light dress. The back dips down pretty low and a lot of lower back is visible. If you are between sizes, size down, otherwise you run the risk of it being baggy and dipping down a little too low. Even when I sized down, the waist was comfortable and did not cut into my sides and create a ""muffin top"" or rolls in my low back.","April 26, 2019","Large"

Also, no worries about wrinkles, the dress travels well, and has its own structure, so it was so easy!! This is what renting was meant to be about! There's swish in the skirt which made it fun to dance in, and on me, it was longer than midi, which for winter was fine - it meant it didn't touch the snowy/slushy ground, and that I was a little warmer.

The length might leave you slightly perplexed; I'm 5'3"" and it wasn't quite floor length but not tea length either so you'll need to carefully consider the height of your footwear. Tip for wearing it: put double-sides tape on the ends of the faux belt strips to keep from readjusting it all night as it tends to flip to its backside with movement.","December 5, 2019","Party"

Dress is true to size so my 14 was too big (and too long) and dress also has stretchy top so a size up made top huge. I had to wear with little jacket or sweater because it just hung on sides. The dress itself is very pretty-has more pink than can be seen in pictures, and the skirt flows beautifully (although at 5'6 I had to wear heels-it is long).","August 13, 2019","Everyday"

My regular size 6 was not in stock at the time I ordered this, so I sized up to 8 and it was no problem. It was a bit loose on the top for me but not noticeably baggy. I'm average height 5'5-5'6 and I would say that I couldn't wear this without heels as the length is a bit long on me. If you're not tall and hoping to wear the dress with flats, this might not be the dress. One thing to note is that the skirt is really light, so it was great for hot summer days.

As others have said, there is gold laced throughout and I really liked that aspect because it did allow me to dress it up. I wore this for a barn wedding in the middle of September, and even though there is a lot of material, it never got hot and was super easy to wear. I also never had to adjust the top, which is a huge plus when wearing an off the shoulder dress! The only downside was the way that the middle is cut. I almost wish it was more of an A line, because the bottom seam does really accent your stomach.

I love the off the shoulders and honestly didn't have to fiddle with the dress at all to keep it up or the sleeves in the right place. It's a long dress but the under layer stops mid thigh so good for hot weather. I'm 5'6 and wore two inch heels and the dress brushed the the top of the ground but didn't drag. The other size that I didn't wear had a very dirty hemline so watch out. There is a stitching line that falls right at your hips that can look unflattering at certain angles and sitting down. I loved it and it is definitely a unique piece to wear to a wedding! Lots of compliments","May 28, 2019","Wedding"

I rented both the XS regular and the S regular because the previous reviews said the dress ran long, and I agree. I ended up going with the XS simply because the S was too long- the fit otherwise was essentially the same. I was worried about the off the shoulder look not staying put throughout the night, but the dress didn't budge at all. The material was fairly heavy for how it looks, but I had no issues dancing or moving around in the dress all day. I would definitely rent it again!","May 27, 2019","Large"

I got this dress for a wedding in Colombia and felt like a Latina Belle! It was modest, but fun and definitely stood out in a sea of blue and green dresses. I am normally a size 4 sometimes a size 2 depending on the material and cut so I tried the small and the extra small and ended up wearing the xs because I was hoping it was a little shorter. I couldn't wear a bra with the xs but it worked out fine. The only cons I would say were it was a tad bit long, or maybe I'm a tad short (even with heels). It was fine if I was standing still but dancing was a bit tricky. Also the lace elastic part at the top got a tiny itchy by the end of the night but didn't even leave any lines or anything.

The style is very flattering as most fit & flare dresses are. I want to say it runs small in the bust but I've recently lost weight and only noticed the tightness when I added a padded bra to fill out the dress better & it's very slight. If you're above a 38DD, as my bra makes me, be wary on that. Size up. Everywhere else fit slightly too big on me, but I'm almost positive it's because I've lost weight rather than the actual fits problem! At that awkward .5 size right now & it'll be a few more months before that's changes. All in all, I feel gorgeous & sexy in a lowkey way. 5/5 will rent again.

As other reviewers have said, size up! A little tight around my waist as the night went on but the 4 would've been too big in the chest. I am a petite 5'2"" and this dress fell right around my ankles. The slit was not a problem for me but I could see it being annoying for taller gals.

I would recommend to size up in general since this does run small but also another size up for backup, especially if you are curvier in the hips since the fabric does not have any stretch. I love the length, which comes up as tea length for me at 5'6. It can be worn with a standard bra or skip the bra all together. Saloni does not disappoint yet again!","August 21, 2017","Small"

I went up from my normal size 6 to an 8 since Saloni dresses are usually tight in the waist for me. I have relatively large ribcage/waist. The waist was still just a tad too tight, and the top was a tad too loose. Length worked well for my height 5ft 7.","August 8, 2017","Date"

The dress would have been a solid 5 stars if it fit better in the chest area. I'm a 32B and wore a size 0. I tried double sided tape, which didn't help while dancing. I had on a backless plunge bra, which was a little help. Someone with broader shoulders, and a more perky chest area, would kill it in this dress. The waist area was a perfect fit, I'm petite.

The navy is a deeper color so pairs well with a navy tux/suit. Just like many reviewers, I found the waistband tight while the straps way too big. I ordered a 10 and 8; and wore the 8. Also per reviewers, I ordered a lot of super sticky fashion tape and quite literally taped my entire front into the dress. The tape held me in all night but by the end was so itchy that I couldn't wait to peel off the dress. Also a note that I was first trimester pregnant (10 Weeks) in this dress and there was plenty of room in the skirt to accommodate a swelling belly (plus a night full of food).

I wear a 36C, and I was busting out a tad more than I had hoped. The shoulder straps were tight and too far apart - they would have been falling down without tape. That being said, I used toupee tape (it really works haha!) to keep everything together. I had no mishaps! I got compliments on the dress, but I really do think smaller chested girls would enjoy this dress a little more than I did. Still, 4 stars!","February 9, 2019","Wedding"

I am very curvy and hour glass shaped and short, so long gowns are very hard for me to wear. But this was a good choice for me. My only insecurity was that my stomach was definitely not hidden but material was thick and with shapewear, I felt like it was fine.

I'm glad I got the bigger size as my backup, because I was barely able to zip it up around the ribs, but the quality of the material holds you in really nicely. You can get away without wearing a bra, since it's thick material and tight enough that it supports you (I'm actually not sure if this dress would fit someone with a bigger chest, unless you went up a few sizes or want a lot of cleavage lol). It might have been too long, I was wearing 3"" heels and it still was about 2"" too long in the back, but it looked fine since it's shorter in the front and wavy in the back.

Fit was true to size/on the large side if anything. I've rented a Tanya Taylor dress before and had to size up, but this fit me great in my regular size. I wore it to work, and the slit doesn't go up so high that it's immodest. My only complaint was that it was a little long for me, I wish it had ended just below the knee, like it does on the model.

I know it was a gamble, and it was just the tiniest bit loose around the waist, but overall the fit was fine. Since the slit is somewhat high, it didn't feel tight around the hips, so pear-shaped renters can feel comfortable trying this out. I'm short (5'4"") so it was a little longer on me than on the model, but not by much. APPEARANCE: The colors are not as bright as in the photo. In fact, the gray flowers are darker.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HLN2","Dionna","Yellow is the color is sun rays!","This dress, above all else, was comfortable! Easy to move, sit, dance in. Good amount of stretch. The slit gives major thigh action when sitting, but I didn't mind. I'm a large C or small D depending on where I get bras. I didn't wear a bra and felt supported (cleavage, there will be cleavage). I received so many compliments and the color is so fun!","October 2, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HLN2","RTR Customer","Beautiful color, really stood out in a crowd","The dress looked great! The color is more goldenrod in person than just yellow, but it is a beautiful color, perfect to wear at a fall wedding. I wore the medium: it fit well on my hips but was slightly big on the top, but I felt comfortable wearing it and didn't feel like I would flash anyone. The zipper did get stuck in the middle, but I was able to zip up and down. The split isn't too high, is very flattering. The dress works best with heels--I tried it on with flats, didn't hang right. Got compliments; I'll be renting this dress again and renting from Rent the Runway again!","September 30, 2019","Large"

The dress ran a tad small in the bust area but I do have a large chest (38 F). I was not able to wear a bra with it (first time ever!!) but i was supported well. This was not a color I would have chosen off the bat but I'm so glad I did. I received so many compliments that evening and I loved how I felt in it. I wish I had a better picture of the full dress on me, but absolutely loved this and so did my husband ;)","September 23, 2019","Wedding"

I received so many compliments and requests where I got it from. Wore a strapless bra and didn't have to adjust anything as the dress fit snuggly. It was still comfortable enough to dance in and eat all the yummy wedding food. The only thing I didn't like was the zipper kept getting stuck in the middle, going over the hem. Otherwise really worth it!!!","September 23, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HLN2","Aurora","Head turning color!","This dress is a stunner! The color is amazing and the thicker material hides small imperfections. I have a small chest and bigger hips and the dress fit great. I did use a backless sticky bra due to the cut of the top. I would also suggest spanx if you are worried about your tummy. I could see it being a tight squeeze for larger chested girls. Overall an absolutely great rental!","September 18, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HLN2","Robin","Compliments all night long!","This was definitely a stand-out dress!! Strangers were coming up to me all night long to complement the dress, fit and color. Color is a bold goldenrod. I'm normally between a 10-12 in pants, and with shape wear the large dress fit like a glove. I tried the XL which was looser but still okay on the hips & butt, but my 36C bust didn't fill it out at all. I still had to pinch the straps a bit to make it fit the top perfectly with the large. The slit is genius - it is high enough that you can bust a move on the dance floor, but the ruffle keeps it somewhat hidden. Couldn't be happier with my choice!","September 16, 2019","Wedding"

I wore it in a photo shoot in West Texas and it was pretty appropriate and looked v v epic. However I would never wear this in the real world. LOL. But it was fun for dress up. Also, if you do plan on wearing this IRL - which, more power to you if you are - the shoulders and sleeves are a bit tight. I could not lift my arms very high, or easily reach my arms out for anything. Also it was a pain to zip and unzip. More of a two-person job if I'm being honest.

It's a real wrap dress, so you thread the tie through, giving some flexibility to size. I tied it super tight so it showed off my curves but you could tie it looser. Two things of note: it was WAY shorter on me than it was on the model. I was covered but I did need to be conscious of my movements to keep from flashing people. The arms are also a bit restricted - you can't reach too high so not good if need lots of movement. The puff sleeves were fabulous and stayed pooped the entire time. I did have to iron it when it arrived. Made a HUGE difference, specifically around the neck area so would not recommend renting if you won't be able to iron.","June 13, 2019","Party"

Wrap dresses (even faux like this one) usually work great on my pear shape, but the waistline on this was an inch or two too high for me. I have a longer torso, so maybe that's why, but it just didn't hit at my narrowest point, so I looked oddly shapeless. That said, if you don't have a long torso, I think it's worth a shot.

It has a little underskirt so when you sit down you're still covered up when the slit moved, which I loved. The velvet adjustable straps were also a great feature.

It's very easy to iron the straps with a hair straightener, so don't let the reviews regarding them being wrinkled deter you from ordering. The fit is pretty tight in the abdomen area, with the breast area being relatively large... again, this is workable if you have the proper bra coverage ( I wore pasties, but it would've been better to wear some sort of full pasty cup because the fabric can sort of flatten the girls out).

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/GOJ6","RTR Customer","Perfect design for a hot summer event...but for the ribbons!","First the positives: the print is gorgeous and contains a lot of subtler highlight colors including pink, bright orange, pale mint green, red and bright orchid purple, so coordinating accessories is a snap. I got tons of compliments. Fun to dance in and really lightweight, wore this to an outdoor wedding on a 90 degree day and stayed pretty cool thanks to the flowing bottom and exposed shoulders! But then, the negatives: as many reviews have already mentioned, the ribbon straps that you have to tie yourself are messy, a huge hassle, and detract from both the overall look and comfort of the dress. They arrived wrinkled and were tricky to flatten, I couldn't tie them alone and they never hung evenly. They didn't stay tight, so I had to enlist help throughout the night to re-tie them - constantly felt like I was moments from toplessness! A better and neater solution would have been to knot the ribbons and pin the knot inside the dress-and from the pinholes I found in the ribbon, someone else had already tried this. I'm 5'9"" and pretty flat-chested, and when I tied the dress tight enough to feel secure it was a couple inches shorter than I would have liked, as you can see from the photo. I think this dress could be great for a shorter person good with creative knots!","July 30, 2019","Wedding"

I got so many compliments and it was perfect for a wedding - easy to move in, lightweight, and the most beautiful silhouette. Did run a tad tight in the ribcage area but not uncomfortable. I was not bothered by the long straps at all and in fact, it was one of my favorite details on the dress. Do make sure you have a friend to help you get dressed as the straps can be hard to tie yourself. Lastly, if it was available in a SP that would have worked better but I was still able to wear the dress with 4'' heels so it did not drag too much. Overall, would definitely rent this stow stopper again.","October 27, 2018","True to Size"

So since I'm sort, and generally small fits pretty great, I went with the SP. It was tight on the chest, but fit like a glove everywhere else. Tight just under the boobs on the ribcage as well. I wore espadrille shoes that are 4.5"" in the back and 1.25"" in the front. So even though it is petite, it was still a bit long, but these shoes were perfect for the dress to hover just above the ground. No support or padding on the boob area, so the super smooth and silky fabric squished the ladies a bit. Since I'm just barely busty, the tightness kept them in place, though it pancaked them a bit. Probably best for women with a B or under, but I still relay liked the dress overall.","October 12, 2018","Small"

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra or no bra since there is an open back. This dress is supposed to be floor-length, so definitely be mindful for that. The pattern on the dress is flirty and fun and the ties add a unique look.

I love the exaggerated floral pattern, as well. Feminine but still modern and the back cut is nice as well. As a petite woman, I appreciated the length of the size small. It hit perfectly at the top of my feet, so I wasn't tripping over it! I wore it both as a cover up for my bathing suit for a pool party and another time, also to a separate pool bbq (where I knew I wasn't going swimming) so I didn't mind that it was transparent. This time, I layered a high waisted, full cut underwear with it and left the top as it. Got a ton of compliments, people thought the underpiece was a part of the dress!","June 13, 2019","Party"

The fabric is not too thin, but it doesn't stretch and you must either wear very discreet underwear or none at all if you don't want to have to wear a slip or something to hide the lines. It's so low cut in the front, I couldn't wear my strapless bra with it. The fact that it has no stretch leaves you gapping in the chest and straps falling down if you slouch at all when sitting.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VIVA1","Lisa e","Nice combination of avant-garde and sweet","I liked the style of this top because the ruffles definitely gave it a feminine feeling, but they are very bold and unusual so that cut down on it being too cutsey. I think it could be styled in a lot of different ways to pull it in either of those directions, which is a real plus. I wore it with a short flared skirt which felt very girly, but it also looks nice with highwaisted black jeans for a more modern look, and paired with a more voluminous skirt or pants it has an edgier high-fashion oversize feeling. I got the top in a S instead of XS because I really didn’t want it to feel constricting or too short – I was very happy with the roomier fit of the S but I am sure having worn it that the XS would have been ok too, just a little tighter (and likely a bit shorter). On my frame, it was not overly cropped – it comfortably fit over skirt that fit at the natural waist.","September 18, 2018","True to Size"

I am between an xs and s when it comes to tops. I originally ordered the xs and couldn't even get it over my chest (and I don't have a particularly large chest), so size up if you are wavering on sizes.

I am long waisted and wanted to make sure I gave my torso plenty of length. I paired it with this skirt, which is also RTR after I saw another girl with this outfit! The shirt definitely needs something high waisted unless you have the bod for a mid-drift shirt. The ruffles kept their shape and it was a very cute cut. I do not have a big chest, so I would guess that if you are very chesty, this shirt would not work for you. Can't wait to rent this again! So many compliments!","August 1, 2017","Date"

I ended up returning the size 2/xxs (already a disconnect because an xxs is usually a 0 or a 00) for the 4. The 4 was still a little tight but comfortable. You could just see the fabric pucker a bit.

One woman stopped me on the street and kept complimenting me, my boss raves about it multiple times throughout the day, and my dinner companion kept raving about it until she finally just asked me for the link as she was considering buying it! I usually fit a size 2 or 4 and sized down in this case. However I would have been much more comfortable in the 4. The bust and ribcage were suuuper tight when zipped. In fact I went to work with it partially unzipped and then had someone zip it the rest of the way! Definitely a surprising hit. I wasn't sure about the colors but styled it with neutral cork sandals and a neutral (light denim) shrug","June 7, 2019","Everyday"

I got so many compliments on the dress and because I was also wearing a velvet headband I was told I was Blair Waldorf by 4 different people ha!! I will definitely rent this dress again for a wedding. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that if you're not standing the perfect position, the dress can make you look bigger than you are in photos due to the excessive ruffles.

The designer hits the ruffles at all the right spots so it still flatters the body, especially with the ruched top and asymmetrical straps. I wore it so many times and right when I posted a photo with it, my inbox flooded with people wanting to know where it was from.

I will definitely re t it again though, it's stunning and the fabric is heavy and feels expensive. It fits like a glove and is sexy but modest at the same time. Just one note- it's hard (for me- impossible) to zip up alone so I recommend single ladies ask a friend to join them while they're getting ready! It also definitely runs small, in between 4 and 6, rented the 6, and could have sized up.","April 12, 2019","Formal Affair"

Once I got in the dress I was fine for the evening. Loved the neckline, waist, and skirt detail and the plus was it had pockets! FYI, if you're going dancing, please be aware that you're unable to lift your arms. At the end of the night, I ripped the sleeve area :(. So if you're considering this dress make sure you order a size up and do not lift you arms. It was all worth it in the end because I felt beautiful and received so many compliments.","January 15, 2019","Formal Affair"

Wore it for a black tie wedding and I felt like a princess all night. The top of the dress ran a bit long on me so my boobs felt like they were going to get out anytime but my friends said I wasn't showing too much so it was just how I felt. I wore petite and it was perfect for me at 5'3. Highly recommend this dress to anyone!","February 4, 2020","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM629","Jasminder","Beautiful dress!","This dress was beautiful! The length fit perfectly on my 5'0 frame with 4"" heels. Only down side was that the shoulders were a bit loose and found myself tugging to keep the dress secured in front (ultimate ended up using safety pins to secure). Works for black tie event but probably wouldn't rent again due to the deep v and it being just a little too lose on me","January 18, 2020","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM629","Kennedy","I received compliments all night! The dress kept the girls together without making me feel stuffed.","I loved the feel of the dress. It was lightweight and flowy. I was initially a bit concerned about how long it would be even after ordering the LONG option, but it was great even with the heels I wore. One of the only cons I have about the dress was the inability to wear a bra underneath. I specifically ordered a larger size than I would normally wear for a bra, but even with the bigger size, I was unable to wear one to the event. Given the snug nature of the bust, it was not a problem most of the event, but there were some near-miss nip-slip occasions especially while dancing during the reception. The design was beautiful and appropriate and I would definitely order it again!","December 21, 2019","True to Size"

It was a backup style sent because my original order was not able to be shipped. I wore the smaller of the two dresses. Waist fit fine, top was a little big. I wanted to get fashion tape, but ran out of time. I wore it with a black bolero/shrug as there is a deep V in the front and back.

I'm 5'11"" and I'll be honest, this dress was so long that I had to hold it up when I was going up and down stairs. Also, I was in between sizes for this dress. The 16L fit me until I got to my ribs and chest. The 18WL was too big on top, but not so bad that I wasn't able to wear it and be comfortable. It just gapped a little.

Shout out to Rent the Runway -- this was my first rental and a couple of days before my event I burned my forearm cooking. The company overnighted long-sleeved options for me, but there weren't many to choose from at that point. I wanted one of them to work, but they didn't fit. Anyway, I wore a big bandage on my arm and nobody commented. I am so thankful, thought, that the company cared enough to help me out.","March 2, 2020","Large"

Not because the piece wasn't great, but because of how I felt in it. The pictures actually don't look so bad. Yet I was just too self conscious to wear it. With my body shape and the size 8, the way the back is designed a bra can not be worn, and I just didn't feel comfortable. It would have been fine IF the my chest filled out the top a little more. I just wasn't comfortable going braless. It is a shame my booty / thighs are bigger than my chest. I really wish I could have made this 8 work, I really loved the look, and feel of the material and it has POCKETS!!!! that is always a plus in my book.

I did like the dress but I don't think I would rent it again. Im 5ft3in, 145lbs, size C and wore a size 6. It fit like a glove","January 6, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS6","RTR Customer","I rented this dress for our engagement pictures. Loved it!","I chose a size 8 since most of the reviews mentioned it ran large. I’m glad I went a size down. I typically wear a size 10 due to my broad shoulders. My chest is smaller so I really could have squeezed into a 6 for a tighter fit. The dress makes your hips and butt look wide but it also accentuates the waist which evens it out :-) Loved the dress, but definitely size down. If you have a small chest, you might need to go down another size.","October 3, 2018","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS6","Kim","Wore this to DEBLA 2018. Felt elegant, yet edgy. I’m shy, but felt still felt comfy with the plunge.","I’m shy, but wanted to try something a little out of my comfort zone, so I went for this deep neckline. This dress is very comfy, and it has pockets!!! I’m 5’4”, so the lace outer skirt of the dress was just above my ankles. But, the mini underneath keeps the dress feeling and looking kinda sexy and airy. I used, and recommend the gaffers tape trick to create a custom stick-on bra: https://bratag.com/boob-tape/ When done with actual gaffer’s tape (a flexible fabric tape with a gentle adhesive), it feels comfortable and doesn’t hurt when removed. I’m a 32D. The tape stayed on all night, and I felt secure. I also used a little double-sided dress tape. Wasn’t needed, but I felt more secure with it. I’d actually buy this dress (if it came in colors...and was less $$$ 😄). This, to my surprise, has been my fave rental so far 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼","October 1, 2018","True to Size"

I received many compliments throughout the night. The dress is very flowy and was almost too large in the bust, but it was fine.

I can wear a dress from a 16 to a 20 depending on the fit. I also prefer my dresses to be flowing and off my stomach. This dress hit the floor on me and I did have to gather it to walk, but I think if I had worn heels, it would have been too far off the ground. It fit beautifully in the waist/stomach area though. It was actually a bit too large in the chest for me. I was afraid to order a 16 since there is not 16W and I was afraid the dress would not zip since I have a broad back. It was very big in the arms, though. I had to use fabric tape to get keep the arms from having huge gaps, so I wound up taking the sides of the dress and the front of the dress to my bra in order to keep it somewhat in place.

The 2 (my usual size) fit well in the bodice but the peplum hit at an unflattering height and added a lot of volume to my middle. The size 4 was a bit big in the bodice but the added length of going up a size really allowed the peplum to lay how it should and was much more flattering. The color can look red or fushia-ish depending on lighting. I did wear a sticky Nu Bra as the back is open and a traditional bra would show. Not the most flattering rental for my body type.","December 22, 2019","Party"

It has a side zipper with hook and eye closures down the side and on the neck as opposed to the model picture with the exposed zip up the back which I would have preferred. The hook and eye closures both kept coming undone all night (very irritating) and catching on the lace when they were undone. I was unhappy that it was different than advertised. Fit true to size. I'm anywhere between a 4-8 depending on the brand and was worried about the lace not stretching so ordered a 6 and 8 and wore the 6.

The cotton is heavier than I expected, but in a good way. My only complaint is that for larger chests, the low cut and stiffer fabric can be restrictive, and the interior clips to close up the low cut are still too low. Definitely get your safety pins out if you've got a larger chest and don't want your bra to be public. Also, tip: tie the sash at the side, not the back! Helps with the fit and with keeping the tie/bow in place.","August 20, 2019","Party"

There are tiny hooks in the front to keep it closed, but they are difficult to hook. It runs extremely large, particularly in the bust. I had to wear a cami under it, and the shoulders did fall a bit. I wear a 6 in most items, and the 4 was big. The 2 probably would have been the winner.

The first being the chest, it wasn't tight on my rib cage, it just squeezed my boobs in causing the buttons to pull at the openings. Then it is also fitted through the waist and given the material, it shows the shape of your lower abdomen.

But that is always the case with sheath or boxy dresses and my body type as I am an hourglass with thicker thighs. Would just note that there is no give through that area so definitely had to tug and shimmy a bit when pulling it on :) As noted watch the sequins as they did catch on a few things. These two small reasons are the only reasons I did not give it 5 stars.

The sequins lay in one direction and aren't reversible like with mermaid fabric. Because of this, the dress is a bit delicate and special care is needed when sitting down, especially in cars.

Like other reviewers mentioned, it's a LITTLE restrictive in the shoulders but I can't imagine it being an issue unless you're planning on dancing.

Cons: SO TIGHT in the shoulders. By 8pm I was ready to rip it off. Also had to wear stickies/strapless bra! Less than ideal for work. Can't imagine being large-chested and this dress working out. It also didn't breathe well? Like sure I had a stressful day at work but by the end it felt like all my stress-sweat had been trapped in by the dress. Oh ALSO the skirt part has no slit and is a column so I had to hold it up to walk/stride comfortably.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BDK98","Maria-luisa","RTR Stylist Review","I absolutely love this feminine dress by BB Dakora! Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back-up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips making it super comfortable. It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a Nu Bra or strapless bra since the neckline of the dress is sheer. At 4’8”, the length hit floor length on me and was sadly too long for me to wear. The dark floral pattern paired with the sheer neckline/sleeves and ruffle details give this dress a feminie boho chic vibe. Pair with red or black heels to complete your look.","March 23, 2019","True to Size"

The ruffles, cuffs, zipper, and liner were all in good shape. The only thing I didn't like about this dress was that due to the seams along the ruffle at your triceps, you can't really raise/reach your arms fully without worrying about busting a seam. So it probably wouldn't be a great choice if you wanted to do a lot of dancing. You'll also need a strapless bra with it since the shoulders are sheer but there's no boning or structure that would make it easy to go bra-less.","November 5, 2019","True to Size"

The lace does cut down a little bit low in the front if someone is STARING at your chest line when you lean over but I wore it to church and work and didn't get struck by lightning (or HR).

I'm 5'6"" 145lbs and hourglass shaped and the Medium hit just above the knee. The laced detail on the sleeves and neckline added just enough to make the dress interesting but still very classy. I wore spanx underneath to suck my belly in, but overall I felt the dress was very forgiving. I rented both the Small and Medium because a lot of other reviews said the dress runs large, but I found it to be very true to size and the Medium fit perfectly.

I was able to wear a racer back bra (38DD) & also wore spanx. I loved it so much I actually bought it. The fit is tight up top--you could wear without a bra, and you don't have to pull it all night. The bottom is tighter so I didn't want to wear it without spanx & show lines or fat but that's probably just me being picky. Overall 5 stars. Good quality material.

I didn't get a replacement size and instead opted for 2 different dresses as it was a last minute swap (I ordered a blue dress originally and attire was all black , haha). I'm pretty sure I could have worn a 4 since this is super stretchy. Wore it for an August wedding in DC - the fabric is pretty thick so I was a bit hot but the slit in the back and opening helped. It does not help hide any after meal pooch as the other ladies suggested but I would rent this again. I am about 5'7"" and the 6R skimmed my ankle with 2-3 inch heels. Length felt appropriate but if you're looking to sweep floor I'd suggest a long. Keep in mind you might need a slightly higher heel.","August 20, 2019","Wedding"

The zipper is sturdy enough to go on a backpack. The neckline and cut of the dress is perfect in every way. It's not stretchy so don't try to do splits on the dance floor but I can't dance anyway!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN159","RTR Customer","It fit perfectly w/ the aesthetic of our friends' wedding, and complemented my hubby's best man duds","This dress though, was made for someone with less of a narrow-waisted pear shape. The 2 fit my waist and bust, but was NOT getting over my hips. The 4 was slightly roomy in the chest and waist, and was tight across the hips. Check the pics (both of the 4) and you'll see how the fabric bunches a little. I also found the seam connecting the flounce to be tight (again, it may have just been my hips/thighs), and needed some maneuvering to sit comfortably. Other than those notes on the fit, i wanted to mention that the lace going down the center of the bodice isn't lined. I wore a skine-toned strapless bra without feeling too exposed, but found myself shifting the dress to re-center it (again, the hips).","June 23, 2019","Small"

I'm giving it 5 stars but it is not perfect. You should be aware, I agree with other reviewers that the neck is itchy, especially after wearing for a few hours. The middle part of the chest is lace and unlined so it does show some cleavage with close inspection but was still appropriate to wear and I wore a strapless bra. The dress has not stretch. Also the hem is very fitted and can be a little tricky to lift if you need to go the bathroom. But, still, I give it 5 stars because it is just so darn beautiful.","June 22, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MN159","Caylyn","Amazing Color, A Little Big","I ordered this dress for an international wedding, and it was stunning. I was very dismayed however to find that when I tried this dress on just a few days before, it was pretty damn big and not just in length which is what I was expecting. I am a small person and well aware of that, but I usually have really good luck through RTR. Knowing I'm short, I was super prepared for it to be much longer on me than the model, but was surprised that it was very large and long in the torso, but not large in the neck. After trying on my backup dress and find out that REALLY didn't fit, I did a quick temporary costume stitch on it to make it wearable for the wedding without my boobs completely popping out. Thankful for those theatre skills. Nonetheless, in combination of the very itchy neckline that other reviews discussed, it wasn't perfect but the look was absolutely beautiful. I got a lot of compliments, and the purple was stunning. More purple in person than it appears online, and that's not a complaint. Wore for an indoor/outdoor French wedding and was relatively comfortable wearing it most of the evening other than the neckline. The length hit my shins at a desirable level that didn't remind everyone that I am aprox. 2 feet tall and still looked elegant. Absolutely beautiful, but runs large. Small people be warned.","June 7, 2019","Large"

I wore this to a derby themed fundraiser and it was so perfect someone else chose it too! I'm on the left. This dress is lovely with beautiful details and gorgeous color--I got compliments all night long! Here's the deal: this is not a dancing dress, there is no wiggle room in the waist, the bust is for a larger chested woman, you will need to go braless or wear a nude strapless bra with no details on the front as the dress is sheer in the center. A few reviews mentioned a scratchy neck. Yes, it rubbed at the end of the night but I think it's from being loose in the busy and shifting as I stood up and sat down frequently. It was not a deal breaker for me, but it was noticeable after 7 hours of wear.","April 28, 2019","Party"

There's not much of a shape to it (it cinches at the middle but isn't very tight on the top or bottom), and it's a lovely velvety material that's super comfortable.

I forgot my backless bra so I went braless and it was fine, but If you have a larger bust you'll need a backless bra.

It's so flattering. The material is so soft and the ribbing gives it a little something different than the standard black slinky dress. The medium and large both fit, but I ended up going with the large because it was more flattering around the stomach and the open back. The tie situation in the back is a little tricky, if you have someone else there to assist that helps but you can def do it yourself anyway. Not something that bothers me, but you can't wear a normal bra with this. I didn't wear anything but otherwise you'd need the stick-on type. Considering buying this one since I got so many compliments. 10/10","June 2, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FP185","RTR Customer","Stylist Review","I love the velvet and 90's vibe from this style! Running true to size, I would recommend getting your usual size as your primary and going one size up for the backup size. The stretchy fabric allows for comfortable room in the midsection and definitely comfortable room in the hip area as well. This style is great for any cup size and can be worn with a strapless bra. This is a floor length dress so if you are around my height, 5,4, I would definitely recommend going for the regular in regards to length. Again, I am obsessed with the super soft material of this dress. I would pair this with a pair of black heels, pretty, delicate jewelry and a metallic, fun handbag.","January 15, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FP185","Brittany","Perfect Velvety Material","This dress has the perfect slit! It could be see through if wearing in a bright place, because it's rubbed and between each rib there is a semi-see through strip. Completely unnoticeable really. But I almost didn't rent this dress because someone else said it was see through. Have no fear! You would really have to be looking very closely or be standing behind the sun to see through. Easily one of my favorite rentals. Because of the velvety ribbed material you could dress this down and wear cute flats. I dressed it up with heels and a fur coat and it was a complete showstopper. Very comfortable. You can adjust the straps if you want more coverage in front. I've got a larger bust and wore it pretty loose on top. It isn't floor length, so if you're y'all, and I tend to wear heels - it will only be ankle length.","January 5, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FP185","RTR Customer","Great choice","Sorry that I don't have a photo to share. I usually wear a medium, sometimes a large because I have wide ribs, and the large here was perfect. It helps a lot that you can adjust the fit based on how tightly you tie the strap in back. The fabric is stretchy and the ribbing felt really nice. Contrary to some of the reviews, I didn't think it was too sheer. If you wear a tighter fit, maybe that becomes the issue. Overall, I loved this dress and would definitely recommend it.","January 14, 2020","True to Size"

The slit does not go up my thigh as high as on the model too, but I still really like this dress. Just a fair warning, the top has very little structure which I am fine with but it's also hard to wear a strapless bra because of the open back.

I would recommend wearing a bralette for work (less push up to expose your chest) or rent this for a night out/date where you want to show more skin.

The dress itself is a rib-knit that stretches but holds you in. The midi-length is very flattering and on the rare occasions that the dress slightly ""rode up"", it didn't look tawdry.

I could have worn a 10 but I think the 10 would have been too short for me. The 12 was comfortable. I was a little self conscious of the front because it gets shorter where it gathers. The puff sleeves were to die for. Neck line was not too low for me. I felt amazing in this dress! Definitely recommend this one to people who want to where something glamorous and edgy.

The sequins were soft and didn't get stuck on anything like other sequin dresses do sometimes. I sized up because the arms were a little tight and where the dress crosses in the front was a little too short in the smaller dress size. Forewarning, the cleavage area was low cut for me, there is a clip, but I used dress tape to keep it up. Overall, I was incredibly pleased with this showstopper and would absolutely rent again!","January 22, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TNT73","Amber","NYE Stunner","Loved the style of the dress. Kind of reminded me of an 80's retro vibe with the bolder shoulders and split skirt. I would say this dress runs true to size or large. I typically wear a 12 or 14 and the 12 fit great. This dress has no stretch though. I have bigger hips, so I was a little self conscious of the split it the front as my hips made it a little more split in the front than what I was comfortable with. It has a very thin lining, but I wore a black shaping slip underneath so I wouldn't worry about flashing everyone and it worked great! Great length in the back and I did pin the top so I didn't have too much cleavage (I am a 38 F and had plenty of room). Color is also a blue/gunmetal and silver.

I couldn't even get my arms in. I also got the 12 since I am in between sizes but the top half was too big in the waist and looked boxy. My first time with RTR ended up being a waste of $100.

The 12 was just a bit more loose, which was only a problem in the chest because I am only a size C and it gaped a bit more than I liked. It felt a tad short for a company holiday party but I'm pretty conservative, no one else seemed to think so. However, when you sit, do be careful, that slit in the front opens right up :) Very flattering if you don't have a super defined waist, it creates one for you with the draping and the waist is forgiving if you eat a little too much over the course of the night.

Very Flattering.","Has a different fit which I understand why other reviews were negative. It bunches at chest and slightly below which brings your eye up and allows for space and loose flow at stomach / abdomen. The shoulder has a fun and sexy cut at back and off the shoulder. Found you could pop it onto the shoulder for a more fun day work style. Then pop-it off the shoulder for evening fun! Great details at sleeve/cuff as well.

I ordered a size down as a back up, and I'd recommend to order a size up as a backup instead. It's a little tricky to take off because even though the side has a zipper, the material does not stretch. Would definitely rent again- so fun!","May 24, 2019","Formal Affair"

With the summer humidity in New York, the closely flip hides any sweat you may get wearing this outside and everyone will love how classy and stylish it is. It does get wrinkled pretty easy - but nothing a quick ironing can't fix. However - WIND and GOING DOWN STAIRS TOO QUICKLY can leave you kinda blind. Everyone LOVED this top - BUT, too often would we be walking and this flap just smacked me in the face. It's a solid top, no stretch. Got a size M based off of other reviews and besides being a little bit baggy I thought it was perfect. Got this cool picture didn't I? Haha.","August 10, 2018","Everyday"

This VIVA AVIVA piece has light pinstripes that added just the right amount of casual to my birthday look. I paired with the Eddie Borgo O-Ring Door Knocker Earrings and the Zac Posen Eartha Mini Crossbody bag and received compliments ALL night!

Perfect for a night out","Definitely size up if short-waisted/thick in waist- I wore the Large because of the side zipper, still puckered at my waist. I wear a 34DD and wore no bra because I couldn't zip with one. If you cannot afford not to wear a bra, I wouldn't risk it if you're busty. Also, it falls short. I have an average torso, and it fell just at about my jeans with my arms down.

I would recommend sizing up if you've got bigger boobs or a wide ribcage. There is absolutely NO stretch in this. I got the medium and it was perfect and I'm normally a small. GET THIS TOP!!

It was form fitting but not tight. Got a ton of compliments and was comfortable all night. My only complaint is that there's a seam where the pleats meet the top portion of the dress and it looks like a wrinkle and/or as if you can see the top of you shapewear/underwear line.

Thankfully, this dress was perfection! It arrived with a few hours to spare before the wedding I was attending. The fabric has a little stretch and is very comfortable! The skirt is ""floofy"" and can fit anyone without needing to worry about measurements (free size from waist down). The top holds you in and is easiest to wear with a sticky bra. I had a laparoscopy and was worried about my bloated mid-section and ordered up a size (US 8) and it fit perfectly. I wish I had a shorter blazer because the floofy skirt does puff out the back of a blazer (it was 38F here!). The color pops! I'd rent this dress again and even buy it if it were ever available.","October 21, 2018","Wedding"

I am normally a size 4 or 6, and I couldn't even zip the 4. The 6 was still tighter than I'm used to, but part of that is just because it's a tight style! The slit in the front is pretty high too (can you tell I'm not used to wearing dresses like this? :) but it made it really easy to move around. I'm 5'7"", wore 2"" heels, and the dress was a great length. The dress is a thicker material which makes it look really expensive.

The high slit and deep V-neck give you some va-voom but the material is thick enough to keep you warm. My only complaint was that the arms dont have much movement and you'll get a little nervous reaching up past 90degrees that you might soon hear a rip. Also, the shoulders have pads.

Color is beautiful, cut & leg slit are flattering but not too sexy, and length is perfect (I wore 3"" heels and it was just off the floor). My only issue was the chest/arms fit a little weird. I don't have a large chest, but it was definitely tight at the seam between my shoulder and chest. The material is nice and thick but has very little stretch. Arm movement is slightly restricted because of this, but it was still comfortable.","December 9, 2019","Party"

I sized up to the medium based on other reviews and was glad I did as the should area is really tight. The elastic part was uncomfortable to start off with and I almost didn’t wear it but it loosens throughout the day. The sleeves do have volume but are not overwhelming.

I wore a small black band around my waist because I didn't want my skin exposed for my stepdaughter's wedding. I am only 5'4"", so this went to my ankles. It was perfect for her Navy and Sunflower outdoor ceremony and indoor rustic chic reception.

My only complaints with this dress were that it began to wrinkle at the lap area almost immediately upon sitting down, and about an hour into the wedding reception the seam in the back of the dress tore.

Due to the straight cut and material (it has NO stretch) if you are a bit hippy or fuller on the bottom you may get some fabric bunching in the hip/stomach area. The cut outs were fine and forgiving for me. I am not very full in the chest so that was not an issue for me, but I could see how if you were it would be less than flattering. I could not wear a bra and did not require pasties. The straps are adjustable which helps with the placement of the cups and cutouts. My dress appeared in decent condition and wasn’t super wrinkled.

It's actually slightly off-white in color rather than the stark white I was expecting, which was a pleasant surprise. The contrast ruffled details were super cute in person, too! The fit was actually very flattering, even with the oversized silhouette. The skirt is very flowy and was fun to walk around in.

Only ONE negative and that was the kangaroo pocket in the front - it is awkward and adds unnecessary material. I like pockets but this looks silly. Luckily you couldn't really see it depending on how I stood and you could use fashion tape to flatten it out. Other than that so many stares! The color was a bright fuschia and I was almost a little uncomfortable with the attention. The straps which some ladies that reviewed this didn't figure out - they go in the back when you step into it not the front and that is much more doable!! I am a 34B and with a push up strapless bra I felt like I had appropriate cleavage. The material is lined but not heavy and I wore it in 90 degree weather and was warm in the pants but it was worth it. I am 5'4"" and length was perfect hitting right at my ankles. I'm also about 128 pounds 28 inch waist and 36 inch hips. I feel like the 4R was perfect with a fitted waist and only slightly tight getting over my hips but once in it it is very comfortable. I believe I am ""short waisted"" because so many jumpsuits hang way down in the crotch and this one did not - yay! My Husband really thought it was sexy and said ""it was a neck turner"".

The dress is gorgeous, flowy and lightweight. I rented the size 2 at 7.5 months pregnant and it fit great (pre-preg 5'5 120 lbs) but lost out to a dress that was a little fancier for the dinner given I was in the wedding party.

Pre-Pregnancy, I was a steady size 6, and the 8R of this dress worked perfectly for me in the 3rd trimester. I probably could have gotten away with a size 6 up until week 30. It's perfect for spring and definitely multi-functional - I did get a lot of wear out if it. Within my month rental period, I was able to wear it to work a few times, to church, and to a date night out to the theatre: easily dressed up or down with different shoes and cardigans. That said, it does have a few slight flaws: you have to wear a cami. It is SO low and I would have been completely hanging out if it. The the skirt isn't lined and the fabric is a bit thin. Yet, there are so many pleats that it seemed not to be too see-through (so much fabric to hold getting in and out of the car!). I'm not used to wearing longer dresses but I like that this hit me mid calf but didn't seem too frumpy.

I have a wider waist and hips, so the fit was snug but not uncomfortable as long as you like form-fitting dresses. This was actually my back up dress but I'm so glad I chose it - I received an overwhelming amount of compliments both the night-of and from people who had seen the pictures I posted of us at the event! A great red dress for any formal event!","February 16, 2020","True to Size"

Pros - the dress is very comfortable, has a nice thick fabric, and the slit wasn't too high and I didn't have to worry about flashing anyone. Cons - I was hoping to wear flats to this wedding, but the dress was a hair too long for that so I had to wear heels (I'm 5'3""). The only other thing was that since I'm a bit bustier at the moment due to breastfeeding, I had to wear a camisole underneath the dress.

The fabric is light and springy but has a nice weight to it to keep it in place. I really hated having to return this dress. I really liked that the top has a built in slip to help it keep its shape. I am smaller in the bust, only an B cup, but somehow the silhouette didn't make it gap like some dresses do when you can fill it out. However there Is defiantly room for someone with bigger breast. I highly recommend this dress to everyone. I really think the ruffles help hid some my flaws but still showed off all my body. I got tons of complainants all day long. One down side I found with this dress is the length, it runs a bit on the longer side. I am 5'8"" and still had wear 3 inch heels to keep it from dragging the ground.

My only complaint (and it might be because of the bump) is that the built in corset sat at a weird place on my torso causing it to bunch up the zipper at the very bottom. Not a problem at all as there is so much going on with the dress no one noticed. I went with flats but the dress was meant for some fun heels. The sleeves were super comfortable, not cutting into my arms at all. No bra necessary with this one, and I was dancing all night!","April 17, 2019","Wedding"

I will start with the only ""con"" that made me drop it to 4 stars - the back, between the lace and the sheer panels, was itchy and got uncomfortable sometimes. That is my only complaint, but when at a formal event, having an itchy back isn't ideal. That being said, the dress is stunning. It's not too ""risque"" though still very sexy and sleek. I was at a non-profit gala representing my company and felt it was a very appropriate dress while still being a little sexy. I love the two-tone. What you can't see in the picture is that I wore red shoes, which gave it a nice, but subtle pop of color. My shoes were about 4"" high and the dress swept the ground nicely, so this is a good potential dress for shorter women (like myself at only 5'3""). Sometimes RTR dresses are very long and even heels aren't enough, but this is a great length for us short girls.","December 13, 2019","True to Size"

There was enough support. All in all this is a great dress. Would definitely rent it again","September 5, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA72","Chelsea","Unique dress. Was perfect for my PA school formal.","I ordered both the 12R and the 14R, but wore the 14. Both fit, but the 14 was more comfortable and I knew I would be in at for a long time. I really felt the 12 looked better, but went for comfort. I was able to go bra-less even at 36C due to the fitted area under the bust and the padding. The zipper was very difficult--even without a person in it. I ended up adding some graphite to the zipper and that helped some, but it was still pretty difficult.","August 10, 2019","Small"

The lower fabric is thick w some give to it. It just fit me right in all the right places. Contrary to the dress description, you cannot wear a regular bra w this dress. My strapless didn't even work w it. Had to wear it without a bra but it was fine. The back mesh panel dips low so you cannot wear high waisted shapeware w it.","June 2, 2019","Wedding"

Very true to size. The long was also very long. Even with 4-inch heels, it drug on the ground. It is a very high-quality material, fully-lined, well-made dress. I thought it was all black from the photos, but the skirt is actually a deep navy and then black lace on top. I think it would have been prettier either all the same color or with a stronger contrast in colors. Definitely need a special plunge bra for this. This is not a great dress for the less endowed ladies, I felt like I needed more boob to fill it out properly.","April 8, 2019","True to Size"

I needed one piece to use to coordinate the rest of the family's outfits, and this worked perfectly. It was a great, summer pattern that went well with our backgrounds. I ordered a 4 and a 6, and like other reviewers said, the 4 was tight around the rib cage. I wasn't able to get it zipped. The 6 zipped well, but was a little loose around the hips. I ended up pinning the back to try to tighten it up around my hips to be more flattering for the photos. The ruffles around the bottom are very feminine and fun.

The pattern was beautiful, and I got many ""you look like Snow White"" compliments with my dark hair. I wore two different shoes with it - the tan flats as seen in the picture, and coral-colored Mary Jane Pump heels - both went great with the dress! The dress was very comfortable, I wore it to both a lengthy graduation ceremony and graduation reception and I felt great the whole time! I first wore it without a jean jacket for the ceremony and then added it for the reception - it was great both ways (I unfortunately only have pictures with the jean jacket). It is a light fabric, so good for warm weather - but thick enough that you don't need a slip. It ran true to size and the adjustable straps were great for me - plus I liked that they were a bit thicker. Two recommendations: 1. if you have a larger bust size, I would definitely get a strapless bra. 2. The dress has one of those hide-away zippers, you may need a second person to help zip it up because it is a little tricky. Overall great dress!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CST14","RTR Customer","Super flatting and a touch of vintage style","This was my backup dress and based off other reviews I chose a size 6. I normally wear a 4. The shape is flattering and I liked the fully adjustable straps! I typically can’t go without a bra (I'm 32DD) - there was space for one but it wasn’t necessary. If you have a butt it will hug nicely and look good with the flounce hem. I might have been able to fit into the 4, but it would’ve been fitted. I’m 5’0” and this was about mid-shin on me. The zipper was hard to do. The first time I tried it on I needed someone else to do it. After that I was okay by myself with a lot of force. I wore this to brunch the day after a wedding. It was easy to dress down with flats and a colored sweater. The base is cream (not beige or tan like a couple other reviews said). Because it’s cream, I think it could be acceptable to wear to a wedding but personally I don’t think I would. I liked the cute pattern and loved the cut. It was a hint of vintage, not over-the-top-retro. It was easy to move around in and not heavy at all! I even wore it on my flight home and it was really comfortable.","October 29, 2018","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CST14","Monica","Bridal Shower","I rented this dress to wear for a bridal shower that was floral themed. I felt the fit of the dress is a little off, especially for me who has some curve. I ordered a 10 which is what I normally wear and I got the 12 just in case...sometimes I am right in between. I got my dresses and the 10 was so snug, but the 12 was way too big...like falling off me! If they made an 11, it would have been perfect. I am 5'5 and 150lbs with a 36D. I ended up wearing the 10, because at least it wasn't going to fall off, but here were the pros and cons: The idea of the dress is super cute with the little kick ruffle at the bottom, but the waist is cut as a natural waist, which I have to be careful with because of my stomach. The snug fit of the dress made my pooch pop out a little too much for comfort. The boob line under the dress wouldn't ""stay put"", and the straps wouldn't stay up. The whole day, the dress was a bit fussy. All that said, I did get a lot of compliments on it, but I was just not comfortable. For someone shaped like the model, I am sure it would be really cute.

I don't have a very large chest (lol ok I don't have one at all), and sometimes sweetheart necklines like this flatter that, however this dress really made it more noticeable. It also ran a little big and I needed to tighten the straps substantially so they wouldn't slide off my shoulders - although it was super convenient that you COULD adjust them. If I had worn this one, no bra would have been necessary. The tulip/flare of the skirt was VERY flattering, though. Also, the base is more of a cream color than white, so I wouldn't worry about wearing it to a wedding (I had several people express concern about this when I showed them the picture online, but I think it would have been fine).

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ALC77","Janelle","Pretty work dress","This 14 fit like a 12, with the exception that the back was a little loose hanging for me. Everywhere else fit great. I'm 5'8"" and this was short when I sat down. Wore with black tights and booties. Silk fabric felt nice but lining is polyester. Would not purchase this dress for the price knowing it wasn't all silk. Overall happy with wearing it.","April 17, 2019","Work"
