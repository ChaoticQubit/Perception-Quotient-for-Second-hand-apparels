The color is a gorgeous blue, true to the picture. Loved the way it was longer in the back than the front and the V neck isn't so low it reveals any unnecessary cleavage.

This dress has a lot of material and will draw attention. The dress is roomy. There are draw strings at the waist to make a more fitted waist for those with smaller waist.

I actually got a lot of compliments on this one. The overall size is in fact large I'm more of a size 14/16 and I could wear this as a 12 - it is fitted in the bust / waist area which for me is my smallest part. Tons of room in the hips/butt and the arm puffs have stretch as well. The wrinkles came out after I wore it for an hour or two.","August 29, 2019","Everyday"

The sleeves are pretty poofy, it's not exactly figure flattering, and it's a bold color. But I'm glad I did because I got a ton of compliments and felt pretty chic. I also felt like a Westworld extra, but I guess that's kind of chic too. Fit wise it's a little loose and puffy, but you can adjust the waist by tying the side tassel thingies tighter. I was trying to hide my tummy, so it was great for that.","June 18, 2019","Work"

I like the slight collar at the neckline and the crossed material at the bodice. I also appreciated the 3/4 sleeves with a silky contrasting material so the sleeves could be rolled up higher to the elbows.

It was fine for just going to the grocery and such, but I would not recommend this unless you're very thin framed and also the sweater runs very big. It's boxy, thick, and heavy.

That was a nice surprise. The patterns looked so cute together. Unfortunately, the sleeves looked super wrinkled and I couldn't see a way to iron them so they would look like the photos even if I wanted to. Furthermore, I usually wear a 0 or a 2 in blouses and got the 0 thinking it would be a loose fit, which it was at the bottom, but the top part was very tight. I would need to leave the top button open and that's not how I planned to wear it... So I'm returning this unworn.

The outer layer is two pieces of fabric that aren't connected to each other, just slightly overlapping on the sides, so they're essentially like a front cape and a back cape, if that makes any sense.

Once I got it on it hung like I was back to being a skinny teen with nothing up top or bottom. Just not a good look. My sister wanted to wear it too since another review said it was good for breastfeeding, but I think it would have been worse on her.

I'm 5'2 and barefoot as pictured - while long, it's elegant and slimming when paired w an oversized blazer. The armpits are a little big as others mentioned but given the fabric I can't really imagine wearing this except in fall/winter. Would wear to work, too.","October 3, 2019","Date"

I will admit the dress was a touch risky for the workplace due to the wide armholes and slightly high slit in the center, but the length and overall nature of the dress is conservative so I went for it and it paid off (with compliments)! The weight of the knit is very flattering and gives the body a very smooth line. Like others have mentioned, the belt was missing from my dress so pack an extra if you are traveling.","September 25, 2019","Large"

I brought it with me to France and wore it twice, once for daytime once for night, and I think it worked either way. Paired it with a denim jacket and mules for the chillier night. The only negatives, as other reviewers have said, is that the arm holes are very large so wearing a normal bra can be tricky. I also found the length to be just slightly odd, but it didn't bother me too much. I'm shorter (5'3"") so would be more normal on a taller person.","September 18, 2019","True to Size"

Very comfortable as everyday dress in spring time. My challenge was the cut. High waist made me even bigger than I am normally and gave no definition. I looked like I was back in 6 months pregnant. That being said, elastic waist made it very comfortable and probably works great as sophisticated maternity wear. I wore it to work as tunic with leggings as the length was a bit too short as a dress (and even more emphasized the maternity look), and this coming from 5'3.

Long waisted magic!","At 5'10, my rise (the point between my Hooha and my waist is 2 1/2 inches longer than the longest rise anyone sells commercially (12"" for highest rise - I'm 14 1/2). For this reason it's virtually impossible for me to buy pants. I have to have my pants custom made and it's a pain and it's expensive. These fit like a glove. It's true I'm wearing them as clam diggers because there's just no way I could wear them at my waist and have them be long enough. Even though they're supposed to be a little short, they go awkward short if I wear them with leg down. But they are super cute. Comfy. Flattering.

The clasp is not stable AT ALL. If I reached down to do anything, it would come undone and the entire shirt back would open. Not functional unfortunately!","September 30, 2019","Work"

The back is almost completely open though so it would not be appropriate for certain settings. It was a challenge to style -- a tank top or bralette didn't look great from the back so I went sans bra, which may not work for larger chests.

I don't think it was the most flattering on me, I have a ""boy waist"", not a super defined waistline at all.

You don't have to worry about love handles because the cutouts sit higher where the indention in your waist would be and not where love handles sit, but of course, if you have rolls higher up this wouldn't be the right outfit. It looks good with heels or flats, and is a good mix of sexy, stylish, and comfortable all in one. I weigh 140 lbs and am 5'6"".

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAS4","Courtney","Fun and Warm","I love this jacket! The blue and pink are so pretty. It's also surprisingly warm because of the ""fur"" lining. I would say it's comfortable for as low as 40 degree weather. The leather is very soft. The quilting, the zippers, all the details, make it an amazing jacket. I felt like a rockstar! The reason for four instead of five stars is it fit perfectly in the shoulders, arms, and waist. However, it was too tight in the chest if I tried to zip it up. I worry that if I went up to a medium, it would be too bulky and lose. Keeping it unzipped avoided this issue. Next time I try a jacket by this designer, I will try a medium though to see.

I'm typically an 8 in tops/dresses (10 in pants) and I wore a 10 in this top, so I'd say it runs a bit small.","February 4, 2020","Work"

I wish there were belt loops to hold the belt if I didn't want to tie it closed. I had to fold the belt and put it in my purse or the coat pocket if I didn't want to tie it closed.

I had read in other reviews how the belt was missing, and when I received mine, I didn't see a belt either, but that didnt stop me. (The coat is still amazing without it an it does have a top button to keep it kinda together if you want). HOWEVER, when I went to send my clothes back, there in a little black pouch in the mailing bag was the BELT! So if you rent this coat and don't see a belt---CHECK THE SIDE POCKETS!

My biggest complaint is that my bra showed no matter what I did. Mostly on the sides -- this jumpsuit is comply side-less, only the long tie wraps cover the sides and won't stay high enough to cover a normal bra. It's unlined and very thin fabric, so I wasn't comfortable going bra-less either. I wouldn't have minded with family or close friends, but wanted to be more modest for co-workers so I wore a cami under it, which was still cute. I ordered the 2 because my normal 0 was not available, and it was just fine because it wraps/ties around your waist, so if they don't have your size you'd probably fine with either bigger or smaller size.","March 16, 2020","True to Size"

It's the perfect balance of cozy and chic, and the fit is really flattering (as far as sweaters go). It hit right at the top of my hip. Because of the different weaves, one of the arms (the dark brown) fits tighter than the other arm (the camel brown), but it's not very noticeable - and, honestly, it kind of adds to the off-kilter cuteness of the whole sweater.

I only wore once and I’m glad I tried them / might rent again, but the fact is despite being sweatpants they aren’t in the end all that comfortable - the material is tight-knit and somewhat stiff, almost a little scratchy.

I find Trina Turk to run a bit larger than many brands on RTR, but this style ran particularly large for me. The fabric has quite a bit of stretch to it, so you might want to go down one size.

After closer examination, it seems there is no navy in the dress, just black. Oh well. The body was huge. The arms were not that big so I worry that they would be tight if I sized down.

The overall look is conservative but a warning that it can be a bit peek-a-boo with the slits on the sides and also at the front placket, and at the arm holes. Also it's fine with nude undergarments but even light pink (usually close enough to nude on my skin tone) showed through. It's very flattering because you can tie the belt however you want, and the sizing is forgiving because the fit of the garment itself is loose. As others note it runs pretty large so don't be afraid to order down if you are between sizes or even if your true size isn't available. I was ok on the 38 but would go down next time - especially as that might help with how open the arm holes were. But it was perfect for my interview and I will definitely rent it again for work or a summer party.","June 3, 2019","Work"

My only knock on this is that there is no liner, so the inside of the SWEATer is cold when you first put it on; it isn't exactly a sweatshirt, more of a heavier long-sleeved shirt if that makes sense. tl;dr: print to die for, size up, no lining, may rent again but not a top choice","December 25, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS152","Lisa e","Beautiful, retro shirtdress","Definitely 50s style/retro/conservative in styling, but great construction and details, and I loved the colors and print. The fabric is a thick, substantial woven cotton, almost like a light canvas, so it’s stiff and keeps it’s form well. In terms of fit, the waist runs true to size or slightly large but although the fabric has some stretch the waist unfortunately doesn’t stretch because of the way it’s stitched. I also found the waist fits quite high – maybe 2 inches above my natural waist, which made it a bit less flattering on my own body. Otherwise the hip and below is unfitted, and the shoulders/arms were to size, with more space in the bust area. The length is longer but not really tea length, about to the bottom of my knee. The neck is fairly tight if you want to button it all the way up. The print is beautiful, the colors are beautiful, and the pintucks and oversize eyelet trim at the chest are great. Be aware that those eyelets are open and not lined (same trim is also just above the knee), so you will be able to see your skin through it – in case you want this to be a very strictly modest look.","August 18, 2018","Large"

The length was great with heels. My only complaint is that the piece has belt loops, but didn't come with a belt. Apparently this is an issue for RTR as it's not the first piece I've received w the same problem. However, I just wore a blazer so the empty belt loops weren't visible.","December 9, 2019","Work"

It is unlined and the material is soft, but not flexible. The cut is adorable and the drape is great. With all reviews, the same comment re: the big belt loops - needs a belt! I am tall and the jumper was borderline short in the rise, but I ate a long brunch sitting and chatting with no issue.

Super comfortable which I didn't really expect and the pockets were awesome. Only drawback which I did not see in other pictures was it has belt loops but no belt/sash provided. I thought the loops were too large to ignore and not wear a belt with it but I didn't have one to really go with it so I think it could have looked better with the proper belt.","October 16, 2018","Work"

It's super comfortable and I liked that I was able to wear a bra with it. I ordered the 6R as opposed to my typical 2R/4R size and I can't remember why (either based on reviews or they didn't have my size available? Who knows) But, I ended up wearing it and really liking it. It's a slightly odd fit. Probably because the silhouette photo suggests that it's a little more fitted with a flare leg. For me, the waist was roomy, but still slimming. The length was a little too short. I think if I didn't receive this jumpsuit minutes before my event, I might have reconsidered. However, it's a good quality piece and I know that had I gotten my size I would've been really happy. I want to order again in a 4L.","October 9, 2018","Party"

Puffy in a fabulous way, but I did wear it to work on casual Friday which was also my birthday. Then I wore it for my birthday party and AGAIN for an art opening dinner event. Each time with different necklaces that made it more or less formal. I sized down to my top half size which is a full size smaller than my pear shaped bottom half.

I would say that the dress does run a bit big, because I feel like I'm closer to a 4 in size, but the 2 fit perfectly!

It was actually really cute even thought it was way too big. The material is very soft so it wrinkled easily. I would definitely rent this again in a smaller size","June 7, 2019","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PMT6","Anita","Warm enough for the slopes","This arrived after my ski trip, but it would have been a perfect ski slope layer. The sweater is warm wool and snug so there is no extra bulk. I wish it was a tad longer, but that's just my personal preference.","December 26, 2019","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PMT6","Katie","Ski chic","I wore this as both a base layer for skiing and around town. It's a great winter option - especially in a ski town. The wool wasn't itchy at all.","December 23, 2019","Vacation"

Hit me 2 inches above my belly button and was so tight I could barely put my arms down. I even got a medium, and I still think the large would be too small.","March 20, 2020","Vacation"

The side slits mean your side and tummy may be seen (I wore a long tee underneath). This sweater is all about details: the two color sleeves, the drape over tops of hands, the soft turtleneck. I love it (actually checking out purchasing).","November 2, 2019","True to Size"
