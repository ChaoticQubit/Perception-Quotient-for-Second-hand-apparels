Love","Was initially worried about the back being back-less as going bra-less or using a non-traditional bra wasn't an option.

I probably could've sized down to a 6, but I was more comfortable with it not being so fitted. I received a 10L also, and the length was VERY short compared to the 8L.

Comfy and stunning.","I'd recently lost 20 pounds, so wasn't sure of my size. I'm 5'3"" and at that time about 165 and the 12P fit perfectly. If my shoulders weren't so broad and I'd lost a few more pounds in the middle a 10P may have also worked. The dress is stretchy, comfy and very forgiving. It also basically feels like you're wearing a nightgown! BONUS! LOL! The open back is beyond beautiful. By the end of the evening the inside of my arms were a little sore from rubbing against the sequins on the dress...but otherwise I'm a total fan. May very well get this one again in the future!","July 23, 2019","True to Size"

I got a ton of compliments from strangers throughout the evening and I felt sexy and confident, but appropriately conservative for the event. The color is a beautiful blue-grey tone - something a little different than you normally see. The low back is unexpected and fun. I wore a nubra, through you could get away with a regular bra if you pinned it down. Overall a terrific dress!","January 28, 2019","True to Size"

Had to wear a shorter heel to get it looking long enough. Loved the dress and would recommend! Saw 2 other gals at the governor's inauguration Ball with the same dress but in different colors. Wasn't a big deal though! Just shows you how awesome that dress is and it looks good on everyone!","January 21, 2019","Formal Affair"

The 12 fit best and was super comfortable to move/dance in. I wore 3 inch heels and it was the perfect length. Towards the end of the night, my arms were rubbed raw from the sequins but I had expected that (I'm an enthusiastic dancer).","December 16, 2018","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM292","RTR Customer","Amazing Spectacular Dress! So comfortable!","So comfortable. Fit snug around the rib cage. I recommend shapewear for curvy girls. Drape in the back had to be wrapped into my bra to hide the bra and to prevent the dress lining to be exposed. I loved the fit. THIS DRESS IS AMAZING. I would like to thank the RTR Customer service agent Chase for finding this wonderful dress for me. To make a very long stressful story short, the original dress I ordered was an extreme disappointment and Chase spent 45 minutes on the phone with me to resolve the issue. Thank you, Chase for your outstanding customer service! The dress was a hit.","November 8, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM292","Kora","A great choice for fancy dress up event.","I was invited to a black tie wedding where the bride asked for us to wear glittery gowns. This was perfect. It's super comfortable, stretchy, not very heavy, and also warm! It is body hugging, so I'd recommend some shape wear if you want to help streamline your silhouette. The 6L was my backup size, and I could have even worn a 4L in this - not that it runs particularly small, it's just very forgiving.","October 17, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM292","RTR Customer","I love the dress!!","I love the dress arrived one day before of the schedule day. I order size 8L and 6R (6L was not available) the fabric is stretchy and the open back makes the dress a little lose, so size 6 fitted better than 8. But I decide to use 8 because it was longer, 6R was to short for me. Nonetheless, it looked incredible!","September 12, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM292","Erica","Sparkling standout!","Love this dress! The stretchy fabric is very comfortable, and the sequins lay flat so they won't tear up your under arms. Perfect for dancing the night away. The dress fits very true to designer size. You could size down for a more snug fit, but given the nature of the fabric and how it drapes think you could even go up a size and the dress won't look too loose. I'm 5'7'' and with four inch heels the long just brushed the floor. The back is just low enough that you'll need to wear a low backed bra, and if you wear shapeware it would need to hit at the waist (not to the rib cage). I was going to wear control top pantyhose, but opted against it since the top line was visible in this dress, since it has no waist line.","September 3, 2018","Wedding"

The dress was stretchy and the 6 fit well. I wish the long had been available, as I’m 5’7” and had to wear flats with this dress. But I was complimented all night. This dress is easy to dance in and very comfortable. I did wear spanx underneath due to it shows every curve of your stomach, hips, and butt. I wore a stick on bra I got at target.

Only got the one size, the 10L as other reviews recommended to size up, and it fit like a GLOVE. I got so many compliments and ive seriously never felt more confident in a form fitting dress like this before. You will SERIOUSLY have heads turning and all eyes on you!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM292","Amy","Great choice!","Wore this for annual cotillion ball. Comfortable enough to dance in all night because it has a lot of stretch to it. Spanx are a must, but don't think a bra would work with it, although I didn't bother trying. Would love for it to be an extra inch or so in the front (I'm 5'10"") as it didn't quite hit the floor with my 2 1/2"" heels; back was fine as it seems to dip back there. Everyone loved the dress, and I loved the lilac for an early spring ball.","March 7, 2018","True to Size"

I was able to wear it without a bra, which was perfect. The length of the petite was perfect with my height and 4-inch heels. I range between and 2 and 4 depending on the designer and this 4P fit great. I wore it to a military/black tie gala, and it was the perfect dress. I would definitely rent it again.","November 13, 2017","True to Size"

It was beautiful on and I got more compliments than I could imagine. It runs true to size. In my opinion one is unable to wear a bra, but if you are able to wear them the silicone ostrich on bra cups would be helpful. I could not attempt those this evening because it was bitter than hades well into the night and perspiration would have been my downfall as one of the silicone bra cups step out of my dress while walking -lol. Anyhow amazing dress and I would have loved to but it but maybe next time.","August 14, 2017","Formal Affair"

It was really hot outside while taking pictures but this dress kept me pretty cool. I had to wear a sticky bra because the dress is too thin to wear without a bra and the back is very low.

I received notification from RTR more than a week out, which gave me plenty of time to make adjustments. Both sizes fit, but I chose to wear the 10 so that I could wear a bra. While the dress is incredibly comfortable, it does hug every curve, so I wore spanx to hold in my ""mommy"" belly.

I have a smaller top than bottom so wore the 4 instead of the 6 which was far too large on top; you want the cold-shoulder sleeves to hit mid-arm, not close to the elbows which looks too long and floppy.

Fashion tape is a must for this dress especially for smaller chested women. I'm 5'2 with an athletic build and broad shoulders and the 2R fit like a glove. Slightly long, but 4"" heels worked fine since the slit in the front helped to not get tripped up. Had to be careful getting in/out of cabs in order to not rip the slit any further.

I am 34 weeks pregnant with a significant change in my bust size due to that fact - I'm probably a 34-E/F. This dress was perfect. Showed the bump off nicely, while allowing me to feel like a woman and be comfortable. It had just enough stretch. I did have to pin the front.

Slit in the front was sexy. Back was high and simple - which balanced out the front - low cut, slit and bunching.

Because I didn't like the fit of the 12; it was too large in the bodice, and because of this, the side not supported by the strap hung strangely.

Also, I am only 5'1"", consider myself petite, and thought this worked perfectly (I would say it was tea length on me). I wore it with neutral shoes, another rtr piece, (my Veda leather jacket that I am seriously considering buying) and beautiful Turkish earrings that I borrowed from a friend.

It was very tight around my chest, shoulders, and underarms but worked out okay for the evening - not uncomfortable, just very snug. I also wish it was just a tad shorter.

The 6 I could barely zip without a bra. The non-shoulder side came up high enough to cover which is sometimes a problem for my bust, but it was just TIGHT. I'm a 30GG/32G. 28 inch waist and 40 inch hips. The waist was perfect, hips perfect, bust was admittedly way too small. I probably would have worn this if I had ordered an 8 (I'm literally never an 8 in anything).","January 8, 2020","Small"

I'm broad hipped and broad shouldered with a big round butt and 36C bust, I do not have slender arms- this dress complimented me extremely well. The peekaboo opening was in a great area- the dress is form fitting and the length could potentially make it a conservative dress, but the window of flesh and my height with heels made the length very sexy.

Unfortunately I found out just 24 hours before it was going to be sent out that they couldn't provide a back up size that I wanted. So I had to stay with the 4, which proved to be a little too tight and the way it sat, it made a 120 lb girl look a bit pregnant. I would have wore the 6 if it was sent to me.

Lastly, the straps were wide enough that my armpit boobs were not noticeable. My only downside is that I was unable to zip it myself as the zipper didn't want to budge where the fabric orientation changed, I genuinely would not have been able to zip it without help, but once I got help it zipped no problem.","March 20, 2019","Party"

I'm 5'1"" and it hit right above the knee on me. The fabric is beautifully textured and there is silver thread woven in throughout the fabric so it shimmers in the light. Overall it has more of a blue or grey tone than a warmer, ivory so be aware of that if you're planing to wear for wedding related events with ivory shoes or accessories. I would recommend, just giving it 4 instead of 5 for the fit and the skirt seemed to hang a little droopy from wear. Great for brides!","December 12, 2018","Party"

The material is a thicker patterned/textured brocade, but probably could be worn any season. Felt sturdy and well-made. I accessorized with a silver belt to give the waist some definition. I more often wear a size 6 dress (on RTR and in real life too) but the size 8 fit perfectly on this, so I would say if you're between sizes order up, especially if you have a C/D+ chest. I would also use the word ""demure"" to describe this dress...as in, it's not a ""sexy"" dress but very charming for a shower or a wedding breakfast.

I kid you not, I got a couple dozen complements throughout the night including a stranger yell from across the entire large hotel lobby, ""OH MY GOD does that dress have POCKETS?! That is the most amazing dress I've ever seen!!' I was 4 months pregnant at the time and though people knew, I was still in that awkward ""Is she just getting chubby?"" stage so I wanted something to hide my mini bump. This dress was perfect! I could eat all I wanted and get bloated and no one could tell. I found it ran a bit tight. I'm normally a size 4 with a small chest but I barely squeezed in the size 6.

It gave me a really nice shape, who was lightweight, and had a skirt that is perfect for dancing. And then I turned around. It's so short. The dress is not designed for someone who has ample bottoms. I thought about flattening the tulle myself, and realized even if I gently steamed down all the tulle, layer by layer, I still wouldn't be able to fit in more than an inch over my butt. I was so so so so so so sad. But alas, it is what it is. I will say this dress will probably flatter someone who has a bigger chest than I do, there was more than enough room and then neck line wouldn't reveal too much cleavage.","August 26, 2019","Wedding"

I actually must have been able to wear a 0, this had a little room around the waist still, but I have bigger arms so I wouldn’t have had room in the arms to go down a size-no stretch there. The color is gorgeous, pairs well with nude shoes. I actually wore black Spanx underneath and you couldn’t tell, but this was so flattering I really didn’t need them. I wore a normal bra and the straps never showed. It was a tad more low cut than the model makes it look, but still had minimal cleavage. My favorite rental so far!

The fit was a little weird - other reviewers have noted that this dress is best if you have a very small waist and big boobs, which I completely agree with. I'm the opposite (small chest, larger rib cage) but because of the thickness of the fabric, you couldn't really tell I didn't fill out the top. I wore a 2R, which was a size too small for sure, but I got it zipped.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM332","Meagan","Bright white for summer","I really like this dress. The bright white really accentuates a tan, a nice rental for summer. I was just unhappy with the way the top cuts in at the shoulders, so it really puts that armpit/breast area on display. You really can't tell in the model photo but it cuts in toward the chest. I'm self conscious of that little fatty pocket which is the only reason I'm not buying this dress. If it was cut straight back like a tank I would buy this right away. I loved the high neckline and the ruffle details are subtle but pretty and flattering. The length is perfect. Totally work appropriate. I wore to work under a navy blazer and lots of people said I looked great that day. Without a blazer you'd probably need a racerback or strapless bra due to the way the dress cuts in at the shoulders - bra straps will show. It is very comfortable and fits true to size, has a little stretch to it. Needed to wear a nude bra and undies but the dress is not see-through at all. No shapewear needed either, dress is forgiving in the midsection. I would like to rent this again.","May 31, 2019","True to Size"

I will probably rent in an 8 at some point for a more body hugging silhouette. Even though the colors are very reminiscent of fall, the color palette works for me and both times I wore it on a cool spring, and brought along a black blazer as the evening got chillier. I know everyone says this, but the outfit got a bunch of compliments and I was really pleased with my choice.

It's romantic and not at all vulgar which was what I was looking for. My one con is that the torso was slightly off for me- there was some bunching around my waist where I wish it was tighter and more fitted- or maybe it would be better on someone with a longer torso? Not sure, but the proportion wasn't quite perfect. Despite this fit issue, I still wore it and it was incredibly flattering. The bunching was disguised by the print, ruffles, and dark color so I don't think it was noticeable to anyone except me. The best part of this dress is the hem. It flows beautifully when you walk or dance, and it's really easy to move in. I was also happy that the length was good on me. I'm 5'1"" and a lot of dresses hit the floor in me- but not this one.

This is such a regal dress and it’s not my first go to item when browsing, but something stood out to me that made me want to try it; it’s different. The dress runs true to size so I wholeheartedly recommend going a size up as the fabric does not stretch. Works best for A to C cup sizes (fitted at bust) as well as the waist. May be worn with any standard bra, and it’s ideal for any body type to be completely honest. This is a cute dress for a gala, a charity event, or anything super formal. You can add your own dash of sass with this bold printed Amur dress. The slit in the front of the dress has t be my favorite part, it adds so much sass!","August 22, 2017","True to Size"

My strapless showed a bit through the little hole. The A-line is flattering for pear shapes, but it is a bit baggy in that area - the dress has pockets (yay!) but that comes with extra material that can adds a little padding to your hips.

When I went to the bathroom I had to find someone to help me! 2-the chest cut low and kept showing the edge of my bra- I am not very busty so I kept having to adjust the straps that ran down the front, they were also frayed so the inner fabric showed.","February 23, 2020","True to Size"

I would say it's true to size as it was a bit tight in the arms, but fine through the rest of the torso and hips. The dress is unlined from about mid-thigh downward, so the peekaboo factor from the see-through fabric makes this tea length more fun and youthful. I would definitely rent again, and am considering buying. I had tons of complements all day wearing this -- more than most of my other rentals! This worked well on my shape which is pretty straight and narrow. The tailoring provided me with a more shaped waist than I would say that I typically have.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RM112","Courtney","Unfortunate band placement","Technically this dress fit, although it was a bit tight in the chest area. However, I found it really unflattering because of where one of the bands hit. It bunched there because the side zipper didn't lay right against the curve of my hip and caused it to bunch up and look like I have a big belly. This is not a good look. I do have a longer torso than most, so maybe it falls differently on me than most. It did come up shorter ok me than the model and most of the user photos. I tried adjusting the straps, but it didn't help because then too much of the top was showing. The straps were also a really itchy, uncomfortable fabric. I wanted to make it work so badly as the print and ruffles are cute. It just wasn't meant to be though.","July 3, 2019","Everyday"

The length was great and there was flexibility in the sleeves. I loved the wrap dress because I could decide how I wanted the fit to look. I did have to pin the front for cleavage issues.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF115","Danielle","Perfect in every way.","Even though this dress has been in rotation for a few years, both sizes came in beautiful condition. I went with the 6 although the sleeves on the 8 were weirdly tight at the biceps to the point of being uncomfortable so I'd agree with some of the reviews about the sleeves. I think it's just a fluke that some run small. The 6 was perfect and fit like a glove. The lace and shorter length give it some sex appeal but it's still a classy conservative dress. Was perfect for my daughter's Confirmation even though it ran above the knee almost mid thigh. (I'm 5'7) Comfortable and very forgiving. Received a ton of compliments including one from the male owner of the restaurant where we had our celebration party. Told me ""that dress looks GREAT on you"" loud and proud right in front of his wife lol. Someone else shot me a text in the church and told me I looked stunning. I'd say this was a home run. It's one of those rentals you'd love to own.","November 6, 2018","Party"

I'm an 8 pre-pregnancy so rented the 10 and 12. Neither fit in the chest... the 10 wasn't even close. I wore the 12 so it would close a bit more but still had to wear a tank top underneath. Since it's a wrap, I could have worn either size in the waist/hip area since you can tie it however tight you want. The lace is really pretty and I felt comfortable, bump included. It was a little shorter than I'd like, but I'm just shy of 5'10 so this is nothing new and I just wore black tights underneath.

My hips are wider and my bust is smaller, so I did have to safety pin the two straps tighter which was a little inconvenient but afterwards it fit like a glove. I did wear this with a strapless bra and pinned the strap to it to hide, because otherwise the top would have completely fell flat, even with the supportive boning. It has plenty of room in the hips and tummy to not feel uncomfortably tight, and with the tightened top I never was having to constantly pull it up as I do with most other strapless dresses.

I did not size up (whoops) and made it work but it wasn't super comfy that way. The dress is STUNNING though and I would totally wear it again. Literally felt like a rock star when I put it on.","November 1, 2018","Wedding"

I rented it for a premiere party for my job so I wanted to look hot in front of all the actors and cameras but still work appropriate. I think this dress struck the perfect chord. UPS didn't deliver the dress the day before my event as scheduled so I had to go get it the day of the event. Luckily the timing worked out but it made me more nervous that it wouldn't fit. Everything worked out great though. The dress fit perfectly. It was really flattering. I wore a spanx thong and a sticky bra with it and never worried about anything all night. I'm a 34DD but the back straps were still a little loose. It didn't fall though and was comfortable all night. Highly recommend it. The only thing I didn't like was that it came very wrinkled and there were still some visible creases even after ironing.","October 6, 2018","Party"

I was happy the dress looked awesome in photos, I had fun wearing something out of my usual comfort zone, and completely sexy!! I had to be careful and cognizant of my posture, not go heavy at dinner, ect. because...dress felt like it ran SMALL. I enjoyed the event regardless and was being complemented of its beauty left and right. Rent away knowing it's not for the faint of heart, if you want to be laid back and blend in where you wear it.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG57","Emily","Loved it - but needs some repair","Would be five stars, but the boning was coming out of the dress in two places and it was poking me which made it uncomfortable. I don't know what RTR policy is on this type of issue --- but it was a little disappointing. The dress other than that was excellent. I'm a huge fan of this designer and have worn several dresses by Him. The material is soft, silky, and stretchy. I always wear a size smaller than normal in his dresses (I'm usually between 4-6 and wore the 2). I am a smaller 34C and there was room in the bust area but that boning (which hurt me) also helped keep the dress in place. I did not wear a bra and didn't even try a strapless one to see if the back showed it. It was a great length - it was long enough for me at 37 years old, but short enough to still make me feel sexy. It was tight on my thighs, but I could pull it up over my hips to use the bathroom although barely (28 inch waist 38 inch hips) I wore this out in Vegas to dinner and to a lounge after and it was perfect. Honestly I would rent again even if the boning wasn't fixed but I would be more prepared ( I'm on vacation so limited on tools haha) and put some sort of barrier in between that and my skin. I think most women would feel good in this dress. My husband loved it.","August 6, 2018","Date"

This dress looked better than the original I had picked out, it had AMAZING stretch so it looked wonderful on my curves, but didn't bandage me in. Super flattering and unique dress and I got so many compliments on this dress. I'm not always one to feel super confident when dressing up, but while in Nashville, I felt like a superstar in this dress! I didn't want to take this dress off it was that comfortable (it seriously felt like I was wearing leggings the entire night).

It made me feel sophisticated and sexy! The regular length was exactly right with a pair of 3-inch heels and didn't get in the way of walking or dancing throughout the evening. The stretchy material made it super comfortable to move in, although it wasn't the best to hide tummy flaws; if you're self conscious about that area I'd definitely suggest some spanx or something underneath. The upper half and neckline were a little loose on me despite being large-chested, and the back kind of rippled along the zipper, but that's probably just the result of having a shorter torso. This dress needed to be worn with a strapless bra, since the racerback straps showed near the shoulders. This was my first rental with RTR and it could not have turned out better!

This dress was too short to wear spank with in my opinion but I was able to wear a strapless bra. I'm a 38DD so that's a must. Overall this dress was great! At 5'7 with three inch heels this was just long enough. I was skeptical because the lack of reviews and photos but I think it's just because it's new.","February 26, 2017","True to Size"

The top was incredibly low cut and I did not feel comfortable wearing it out of the house without a cami underneath. I did not have the issues other women had with the button coming unsnapped though. The bottoms were also really short. I never felt like I was hanging out, but everything was riding up. Overall, it was really cute when I was standing still, but as soon as I started moving, it was hard to ignore how small the romper was.

It is pretty low cut, so I added a lace bralet to cover up some décolletage. It was snuggest through the waist but oddly, going up a size didn't remedy this much, just made it a bit saggier through the back. Loved the pockets, loved the sleeves and fabric. V flattering through the torso and bust, but not a conservative look. Even on short people, it's going to be short in the leg.","May 2, 2019","True to Size"

I used double-sided tape that's made for fabric to keep it together at the top, though it didn't last the entire night so I just accepted the looseness. I would say the romper overall fits true to size, but I labeled it as ""runs large"" because of the top area. Otherwise, I really loved it and it was so flattering!","August 12, 2018","Large"

The fit was perfect on my frame (6'1"", 180) and was super comfortable. The dolman low back adds some party in the back to the classy front. I was able to wear a low back long-line strapless bra without any problem. The dress was also long enough to wear the mid-thigh spanx. I was very happy with the length of the dress on me, and for those of you who also have broad shoulders, the cap sleeves fit just fine. It was so nice that it fit so well and didn't need to be adjusted throughout the night. After a few hours, the sequins on the edge of the armholes did start to feel rough, but not enough to make it uncomfortable. This would be a great dress for NYE, holiday parties, etc. I might rent it again!","November 9, 2018","True to Size"

The neckline is low, so if you're not comfortable with cleavage it's not for you. This is a slightly more relaxed fit than your average Herve. I could have worn the xs, but decided to go with the small for a slightly more modest fit. This dress also has a long waist, so if you're short waisted or just short, it might not be the fit you want/expect from an Herve.

I've never wore a Herve dress and from the reviews I read, a size small seemed like the right fit. I could have gone with the xs I think because after a while it was a little stretchy (the small did) but overall, It fit AMAZING and I loved it!! I didn't want to send it back. Only ""con"" would be that the chest does fall a little low and it occasionally showed my bra, so I had to keep pulling it up- that could also be because I have a small chest. But I read this on other reviews and it is true- the chest falls down a little bit- nothing that ruins the dress or makes me love it any less, just something to be mindful of.

I emailed back and forth with one of the RTR stylists, Brielle, who helped me pick out this particular dress. I’m about 6mo pregnant and only 5’0” talll without heels so I needed some guidance- she pointed me to this dress because of its stretchy material (for the bump) and because it’s not as long as some other dresses. I’m usually a size 0 and I rented the 0R and 2R, both fit me great but the 2 was a little too long so I stuck with the 0. I wore 3.25” heels and probably could have worn a little higher and been able to stick with the 0. The dress itself is so comfortable and elegant- I received compliments all night.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM318","Kemberly","Comfy fit with lots of Compliments","This dress is awesome. It's a very comfortable fit for a curvy, full busted figure. I wore a 12P, but would have preferred a 12R were it available. The lenght was a little short for my 5'5"" frame and heels. The look is very classy, with the split perfectly designed to show some leg, but also wear shapewear, if desired....which I did. Would definitely order again, but in a 12L. My only complaint is that the dress was received extremely wrinkled and with white marks on the lower body. I was able to remove the marks and knock the wrinkles out with a quick spin (no heat) in the dryer. I would suggest RTR pay more attention to the rental items before shipping them out to the customer.","December 12, 2018","True to Size"

The fit is great. The material, while stretchy, is forgiving and flattering. Felt high quality. Fit my curves really well. The assemytrical top and slit showed enough skin to be sexy, but not over the top. I highly reccommend it!","December 9, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ASR47","RTR Customer","Tinkerbell Costume Party!","This was the CUTEST Tinkerbell dress for my Halloween costume. However, the dress material has ZERO stretch. The photos made me think that the material was slightly stretchy. I read the reviews and selected the small, with the medium as a back up, and BOY am I thankful I did. I have bigger hips, and the medium was extra tight, it even pulled the slit seam out when I tried to sit (only like 2"", and I was still able to wear the dress for the evening, but no sitting for me! Oops!). I have 34AA chest, so I had to wear a push-up bra and do some tinkering (pun intended) to hide the bra through the keyhole in the chest to balance everything out. I had anticipated the material to allow some stretching and accommodate my hips, while still fitting my chest, but unfortunately that didn't happen. While I was really happy with the finished product for a costume party, if you have wider hips and plan to dance for the evening, I would make another selection.","April 10, 2020","Small"

That said, I've previously worn Carven dresses in a size 34 - the only reason I took a 38 this time is because that's what I tried on at the RTR Georgetown location. I assumed it would be too big, but it honestly fit like a glove. If I had ordered my usual size, I doubt I'd be able to zip it in the rip/chest area. That said, I'm excited to wear this again! 10/10 recommend.","May 27, 2018","Small"

The online pictures make the dress appear more pink. In person it's definitely more orange. But a very pretty orange. The bow was SUPER cute. The pockets were convenient.

Very modest. So many compliments on the color, the bow, the pockets. It was a hit for sure. What I really disliked is the way the bodice fit. It was so tight and the seams hit at a weird place on my chest. I tried bra, no bra, it just didn't make a difference. As you can see in my picture, it appears as if I'm ""very cold"" lol.

This dress photographs fantastically and doesn't need to be ironed or steamed before wearing! I traveled from California to England and took the dress out of my suitcase and went. My only caution would be the material around the belly. As you can see in my pic, it creates more of a chubby tummy appearance than I would prefer, but the pros outweigh the cons in this case. If you think you'd be self conscious about the belly area, I'd suggest a different dress.","June 2, 2018","Wedding"

The straps were super long and I felt a little uncomfortable all night as they constantly fell down. Additionally, there was extra fabric in the midsection because of my height (I'm 5'2"").

I think it was a bit longer on me than it's supposed to be, hitting below the knee, but it still looked great. It hugged my curves without being unflatteringly tight, and the lace was pretty forgiving of areas that might be too clingy for comfort. The only problem is that the straps were WAY too long.

I don't have large boobs by any means but they're not small either and I have never put on a dress true to size that was loose in the chest. If I had some sort if backless bra it probably wouldn't have been an issue but going braless caused a more loose fit.

It still looked great though and received a bunch of compliments. It would be difficult to wear a bra with this dress but there is boning built in to help hold you up. I didn't wear a bra and I have a 34DD chest and was comfortable. I would think a small bust would have trouble wearing this dress with out a bra and would be too large.

Favorite feature was the cutout lace detail on the low back. I was torn between the 2 and the 4, as the 2 bunched at the waist creating a gap/wrinkle but the 4 looked overall too big. Was very loose in the top as well and the straps are long. As the night when on the straps cut into my shoulders when I sat. Overall, beautiful dress, glad I rented it but some fit and comfort issues.","July 12, 2016","Wedding"

I feel like it looked even better in person than in photos--I got a ton of compliments throughout the night. It was the perfect blend of conservative and sexy. The back was lower but the front was very conservative--not a lot of cleavage. I did not wear a bra and I am 32DD/typically a size 4 but wore a 6 in this dress and it fit like a glove. Might be an issue for straighter figures with smaller chests. Hourglass figures should size up. Overall I loved this dress and I'm sad to be sending I back.","May 31, 2016","Wedding"

That led to some extra fabric in the stomach/back so it definitely wasn't a super fitted look. But since the top is delicate and it's black it didn't look frumpy or ill-fitting. The back is a little low so I wore a plunge strapless (sort of like a bustier) and that worked with the cut. I liked the asymmetry of the straps, and the leg length cut well to lengthen the legs with stilettos (cropped above the ankle).","December 26, 2018","Party"

A couple of times one of the buttons came open which exposed my bra strap so that was a little annoying. Fits TTS, even a little loose. As you can see it is not very form fitting.

I really enjoyed how light and fun this dress was, fitted in the waist but slightly large on me in the bust. I had to wear a jacket over it to work and have a colleague button up the tiny buttons in the back when I got there. But it's also a dress that I got so many comments and compliments on, including from two women I don't even know but proceeded to have a 5 minute conversation with on the benefits of RTR and how helpful reviews are in figuring out what to wear--hence this very thorough review. TL;DR: have someone help you button the back, it's a little large in the bust but totally fun and worth both those slight inconveniences!","June 5, 2019","Everyday"

Only wear it if you don't mind the back coming completely open all the time. Also it's impossible to put on by yourself - you will have to have someone help you button it up.

Also, there are no pockets, which is kind of a bummer, but then you can just get some fun gloves and accessorize more! One of the things I love about this jacket is that, even with a thick denim button down under it, it still fit nicely. However, if you are really worried about fit, I would size up for your backup.

While the dress is decently flattering, I was not a fan of how hard this dress is to get on and off. It has a side zipper (why??) and zero stretch, and when you try to take it off the sequins catch your hair and you end up ripping out half the hair on your head. The main reason I didn't wear it though is because the asymmetry of the bottom bothered me. The right side is very fitted and the left side is looser. So basically the dress felt like it was cupping me on one side so I constantly felt lopsided. I also don't think it was super flattering to be cut that way, but that's just me.","March 6, 2019","Party"

Photographs beautifully and is a deep, true red, not orangey and not purple-y. Warning for my curvy sisters though - it is very small in the bust! I am a 34B and was a little squished in a size 2. But for those with small busts who want a strapless gown that doesn't feel like it's going to slide down at any moment, this dress is great! It is perfect for photos, hangs great and doesn't flap around or catch light weirdly. I was very happy with it and my owl approves as well!","December 24, 2019","True to Size"

It's definitely small, especially in the busy - I wish I had had a large to compare to, but the medium worked and the boning on the sides wasn't too restrictive. Loved the pockets too, deep enough to fit everything I needed for the evening so I didn't need a purse, plus the weights on the hem meant I could dance with things in them and they stayed in the pocket. Would definitely rent again!","November 22, 2019","Wedding"

I received so many compliments and it felt amazing to wear. The top is snug, so it doesn’t slide down and has grips on it which helps, the length is nice, it didn’t go past my ankles, so it allowed for any type of shoe to be worn.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CMO31","RTR Customer","Loved renting this dress! It was a VERY tight fit for me at first, but ended up being comfortable!","Such a beautiful dress. It was extremely tight for me across the rib cage, which is where it holds up, rather than squeezing under the armpits. (I’m 5’9” 157 lbs, and 36B) I ordered a Large. It was difficult to take deep breaths until the fabric stretched out, but I was glad it didn’t squeeze my armpit/boob/back fat! The waistline hit me just right, and the length was perfect. I felt so pretty all night! Heavy material, but it stayed up well for me. I did use a strapless/backless bra with it bc it offers no bust support and the fabric is thin enough for nipples to show! Pros: gorgeous, rich color; comfortable fabric; pockets; shows off shoes but is still a modest length; squeezed my rib cage to stay up but not my boob fat/back fat/armpit fat! Cons: no bust support; heavy fabric; only up to size Large on RTR;","December 7, 2018","Small"

That being said once I tried it on and put the accessories with it I fell in love. I rented the 4&6 after reading that E&J dresses tend to run small. I never had to try on the 6 because the 4 fit perfectly. I couldn't wear a bra with the dress because you could see the sides from the armholes but I felt secure enough to go bra less. I'm a 34DDD and the material was thick enough and had enough support for all night dancing. The bottom of this dress is a dropped waist so if you stomach is your problem area I wouldn't recommend this dress. It is hard to wear spanks with because of the cutout in the back. The skirt part also reminded me of a cheerleading skirt with the pleats but it didn't come off as too cutesy. I would rent this dress again or any dress from Elizabeth and James as they're perfectly suited for petite women.","March 28, 2017","Wedding"

I wore it for a winter wedding, so I had to wear a jacket over it for part of the night as I was chilly without sleeves. At 5'10"", it was quite short on me, so I had to wear tights, but I could have worn it to a different type of event or in warmer weather without tights. Definitely runs small, so order a size up! I was able to wear a regular bra with this dress.","January 4, 2017","Wedding"

Thick material, but that made the dress super comfortable. Not too short but no longer than mid high length. Only small issue was that it was difficult to zip the top section in the back. I needed assistance and the zipper got stuck on the material. But a little patience fixed it! I got tons of compliments and I'm considering going out and buying this dress for future events.

I don't have much chest so the top part was lose and made me fear of a nip slip. I also have a short torso so I felt it was longer than needed. I got the M cause I'm bigger around my hips and butt, but it was quite short and my cake was probably hanging out a couple of times.

This dress was a beautiful blue that stood out in the crowd. The spit was a little high when sitting down but not too bad. It was comfortable to dance in and the best part was that I didn't have to wear a bra with it and the girls still looked amazing, which at 36DDD it doesn't happen often!

I rented the 18, and it was a little loose in the stomach area, but that was actually perfect to feel comfortable while at dinner.

Since I'm petite, the sleeves were extremely long on me so I had to fold them up. They stayed folded the whole night so it wasn't an issue. The necklace was a little bit low cut for my taste, so I just used a safety pin to fix it. Overall this dress is high quality and very in style with the high slit.","June 23, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/STS29","Scarlett","Sexy but SO scandalous","The slit is incredibly high, I am only 5'5 but I had to bobbypin the slit to make it more appropriate. If you are relatively ""hippy"" you might want to size up since the tighter the hip area, the higher the slit. I also fashion taped the bust as this dress ideally works for people with smaller busts IMO. Because this dress needs a lot of adjusting and pinning and taping, I would not recommend this for an event that has a lot of activity like dancing or walking around.","April 30, 2018","Date"

I have square shoulders, D breasts and small waist with wide hips. I am nothing if not an hourglass. That being said, the dress fit different;y on different parts of my body. Tight on my hips so it did ride up at times; fit good on my waist with no issue; very loose and open at the bust; fitting nice on my arms but a little long on the sleeve. All aside, I did really enjoy it because it showed my assets very well (maybe too well). But I like risqué. I wore no bra; I actually taped my breasts up with duct tape and they looked great. It wasn’t uncomfortable the way I did it; I also used double sided tape to adhere the dress to the duct. And all was well.","February 25, 2018","True to Size"

The dress was tighter on my arms than I'd like but apart from that it fit like a dream. The slit was high but not high enough to show underwear and there was room in the waist and butt/thigh area so I didn't feel restricted in the dress.

Yes, it runs a bit small (a bit tight around the ribs in 1 spot) BUT I still wore my regular size!! Such a flattering fit, too! I tied the sash in a square knot on the side of my hip & it looked very nice. I did NOT wear a bra, just some tape & you couldnt see it :) I got the Regular length since i was wearing flats but would definitely suggest the tall if you wear any type of heel (im 5'8)","July 17, 2019","Small"

I decided to go with a 16 & 18 only because I saw from previous reviews that the rib cage was tight and they weren’t kidding. I thought that I could get away with the 16 but it was really right in the rib cage area. I had to wear the 18 although the bust area was a bit too big.

(I did well with having my phone away, I guess.) I'm SO glad I took the 4 as well as the 2 - the 2 was surprisingly tight, but I do go between a 2 and a 4 about 50/50 when it comes to dresses. I wore pumps with about a 3 inch heel, and with my being juuust under 5'5"", the dress hit just at the right spot, lengthwise. I received so many compliments - it felt elegant but not over the top. Also, it's a super low-maintenance dress in terms of needing to be fussed with during the event. Definitely recommend an updo and some sparkly earrings.

I said that this dress runs true to size, but it *may* be a tad on the small side - but not enough to say that it runs small.

Luckily I had backless & strapless cups that worked perfectly. It was tight enough in the chest for my boobs to be held in place.

I'm glad that I did and was able to wear the size 8 rather than my usual 6. It was tricky zipping up by myself (thank goodness for SO's that can help with zippers), but once the dress was on, I was stunned by how well it fit and how pretty it flowed.

There was no bulging around the cutouts. The hem is interfaced to make it heavier and keep it's flouncy shape. It was a fun touch and this dress twirled like a dream. But the construction of the hem was wonky. It was like the interfacing was too big and bunched up in places so the hem twisted in some places. It was a little offputting but it was the only negative for me. You can wear a regular bra but I needed fashion tape to keep the bra straps from slipping out. The shoulder straps are cut in a little from where a typical bra strap would lay. Totally recommend this dress.","December 17, 2017","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL232","Caitlin","Beautiful dress!","Rented for a formal wedding...color is fantastic! However the fabric is a satin-y so it wrinkles easily and no stretch. Other con is that there is a weird seam right at the natural waist and right below the bust which I found unflattering. I am a typical 4 and had to size up to a 6 here. Length was perfect for me - 5'5"" and could wear 3"" heels and it did not touch the floor. Received lots of compliments on this - great choice for holiday!","October 11, 2018","Wedding"

Running true to size with limited stretch, I recommend wearing going up for your primary size. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works best for cusps A-C sizes. You aren't able to wear a standard bra with this formal look. I recommend wearing a strapless bra. At 5'8, the length hit tea length on me. Pair with a strapped sandal and simple accessory to complete your outfit!","September 27, 2018","True to Size"

I love that this vendor uses heavy quality fabric, but it is still breathable and fluid. This dress was dressy enough, but not too formal. I also loved that it fit me. As a petite woman, it is extremely difficult to find dresses that fit in the torso or across the shoulder area. This dress would look great on a taller woman as well. It was very comfortable and easy to move around. Highly recommend!","December 11, 2018","True to Size"

I recently lost 30 pounds so I was unsure if a size 10 or 12 would fit. Thank goodness they offer a free size. The 12 was snug but it's supposed to. I needed help zipping with even going to the bathroom so it's very form fitting but absolutely beautiful. I am a size 10 in jeans and my bust is a C cup. It does push down on your chest so just wear a padded strapless bra. Many reviews from other customers were size 4 so i was a little nervous. If your between a size 10 and 12, this dress will make you feel incredible!","December 10, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS25","Marissa","Fun & Classy Dress!","The reviews on sizing for this dress are mixed, but for me it ran small. If you have a butt or hips, I would recommend sizing up. I am usually a 4 and wore the 8. Both the 6 and the 8 fit when I tried them on, but the 6 was very restrictive through my butt and hips. The 8 gave me a little more breathing room to walk and dance. Other than sizing, the cut is conservative but the slit and ruffle give it some sexiness. It looks great dressed up with some statement jewelry and shoes!","October 16, 2018","Small"

I was a little worried since some of the reviews said it ran small, but it worked out perfectly for me! I felt it was pretty true to size, but the top has no stretch, so if you have a larger bust, you may have issues. I’m a D cup and while the top was snug, it worked out fine. If you’re larger than that, it may not work for you. I got SO many compliments on this dress! It is incredibly flattering, and the material is thick enough to help hide any imperfections. It’s a beautiful dark navy color. It was perfect for a formal wedding! I’m actually sad to return this one, I wish I could keep it!","October 14, 2018","True to Size"

Though I typically wear a size four, I was glad I ordered up for my back-up size, and ended up going with the size six. Though the six fit perfectly to my body shape, I discovered that the seem was ripped where the dress ruffles at the legs and I had to put my wrap across my thighs whenever I sat. You also cannot wear a regular bra with this dress due to how it cuts inward at the top, but I wore adhesive cups and that worked perfectly. Despite the tear, the dress still fit well and I received many compliments on how it flattered my shape.","October 2, 2018","Small"

I'm fairly busty (I think a 32D but don't quote me on that lol) with some tummy and hips and a 6 fit like a glove. I wore a bra but you may be able to get away without one.

I liked the fit, but it was definitely on the tighter size, so I suggest sizing up if you prefer a looser fit. I got both a 4 and a 6 as my back up size. Went with the 4, but it was nice to compare the two. Will definitely rent again and even have considered buying.","December 18, 2018","Party"

I am only 5'4"" so the dress wasnt wuite as short on me as it is on the model. I worr a strapless bra because of the lacey top, but probably could have gotten away with a regular nude bra. Great dress!","December 8, 2017","Work"

I wore this dress to my work holiday party and it was great. I read the previous reviews and how everyone ended up wearing the next size up and thank god I did. The band where the top meets the bottom was tighter than expected and I went with the next size up. You couldn't even tell, it wasn't baggy anywhere, the only thing was that the shoulders were a little higher but this only happened when sitting down. Dress was so comfy all night and I would absolutely rent again!","December 5, 2017","Party"

I had a hard time choosing a dress to wear, but I'm so glad I picked this one. I ordered the 4 (my regular size) and the 6 because I have gained some weight in my pregnancy so far. I could have worn either one, but the 4 was a little more snug and was a little more flattering. I am larger chested, but I wore the 4 without a bra and I felt really secure because the dress is structured and the lace is thick. Would definitely recommend!","October 22, 2017","True to Size"

It tucks in at the waist and hugs the hips but not too tight. I even was able to wear a regular bra with straps and you couldn't tell (usually an issue with lace top dresses). The color block makes it stand out in a sea of black dresses, but it isn't too showy. I got tons of compliments at my work party and was able to dance the night away without any issues!

I wore a flesh colored bra and it was completely invisible with the sheer lace back of this dress. Got tons of compliments. I'm quite short and the length was perfect even though it wasn't a petite size.","March 10, 2020","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL180","Dana","Black tie opera event","I rented a few dresses through unlimited to choose from for the event but this one really stood out. And it is so comfortable. The dress looks amazing on, but you can see that from the other review pictures. So I decided to do a close up of the fabric, appliqués, and bottom lace. I was very surprised by the quality of the fabric. For some reason I was expecting it all to be lighter and not of this quality. I didn't notice the appliqués until I received the dress but I really like them. The fabric has a sheen and is slightly ribbed. The pattern evokes flowers, but is also kind of abstract. The shape was great to define my waist. I wore a sticky bra but could have gotten away with no bra. This is a dress to wear if you want to be noticed and a no brainer pick.","March 22, 2019","Formal Affair"

I needed a fancy gown for a gala with the dress code of ""fabulous cocktail"" and this dress totally delivered. I typically wear a size 4, occasionally size 2 in dresses, and I ended up going with the 2R, which was perfect. It was tight in the waist (which I wanted) and had a beautiful poofed bottom, which made it feel extra fancy. It was also fitted enough on top (I'm a 34b) that I didn't need a bra or tape (huge bonus). It was also very comfortable and has big pockets that fit my phone and lipstick. I got a ton of compliments, and this was a party where people REALLY dressed to impress. I honestly considered buying the dress because I loved it so much! RTR service was amazing as well.

The fabric is heavier and does not stretch, so I didn't wear a bra. It also does not wrinkle at all. One note: if you have a larger chest (bigger than a B/C cup), the top may be a bit snug as there is no stretch.

It's ideal for a casual or even semi-formal event paired with nice blocked heels or even a point toed pair. I'd recommend a solid colored bag to match!","August 10, 2018","True to Size"

It moved so wonderfully and was fun to dance in. Great fabric, the sides/arm holes were just the right size so as to not show too much side-boob. (Be sure to note that the backside is back-less, so you'll need a sticky bra. That was something I didn't notice in the photos ahead of time.) I would say this dress is true to size, though I am often between sizes and was glad I sized up to a large so that it wasn't too tight in the hips. For someone tall, though, I will say that without heels it is possible to trip as it will drag on the floor a bit. Nothing too dangerous though!","August 15, 2019","True to Size"

I have a small chest and wide hips and it hung perfectly. If someone had a larger chest I could see that the top may have been too tight. I wore a sticky bra for the open back but could have gone braless as the dress isn't sheer. The band under the boobs is a little tight/doesn't give so if you have a wider chest/rib area you may need the next size up.

It was a beautiful dress, but the top was way too big. I am fairly small chested, so if you are bigger on top that may help. I did read other reviews about the open back, and wound up buying a sticky bra to wear with it, which worked well. Whereas the dress is big on top, it is fitted in the mid-section, so I don't think I could have gone down a size. I also think this dress works a lot better if you are on the tall side. I'm only 5' 6"", and without heels, the bottom of this dress brushed the floor. With heels, it was still almost floor length. I would have preferred it the length shown on the model in the picture. It was a fun, different dress, though, and I would rent again if I could figure out how to make the top a little more fitted.","August 27, 2018","Large"

There is zero give at the bust line, however, so if you're like me (36DD) it probably won't work. Maybe a 34DD could have worn it, though. I am normally a size 6 and I could barely get this dress in a 6L to go over my hips, though. My back up size, 8L zipped all the way up but would NOT go over my boobs all the way and I really wasn't going for the busty bar-maid/half hanging out aesthetic. It zips on the side which is normally easier for me to get into with tight dresses. The 8 was already pretty roomy in the torso, so going up to a size 10 would probably have looked ridiculous on me. I really wanted this dress to work, but once again the ""ladies"" betrayed me. Sigh. I'd totally recommend it, just make sure you size up!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM355","RTR Customer","I have never looked so glamorous!","I attached a few photos that demonstrate how NOT purple the dress is. It is a royal blue that appears purpley in some lights. I got it to wear with my mask, which has a large range of purples, but the dress was too blue. Ultimately it didn't matter because I looked incredible. The dress is well-made and glamorous. The exterior material is thick and it has a light liner. I have small boobs but I had no issues keeping the dress up. My alternate size had wires sticking out, so do check for that when you receive the dress; it would have been unwearable due to the constant pricking. The 2R was a little long on me (5'3"") with 3"" heels, but the back was designed to be a little longer. My hips and legs are my largest body parts so I usually put dresses over my head, but the liner wasn't cooperating (kept riding up, folding over) so I was very grateful that the zipper went very low, making it easy to step into it, even with larger hips.","November 4, 2018","True to Size"

The gala was circus themed so I needed color. The color is cute, but the material makes the dress very tight and unforgiving. It runs true to size - that is to say sizing up won't help if it's too tight. I received a lot of compliments throughout the night but felt a little Marilyn Monroe-ish...kind of kitschy. Also, I wore the 6L...I'm 5'3"" and wore heels and ended up being happy with the length. Probably would only rent this dress again or one like it if I had to for a conservative, formal affair.

I usually wear a 6-8, and the 8 fit perfectly. The material has a good bit of give and the quality is great. It hugs the body without showing every bump, and the sleeves stay up with no problem. I would be wary if you do have larger arms, as the sleeves are pretty tight on my average size arms, and there is a good bit of cleavage on display if you have a medium to large chest. I noticed that some reviewers noted that the dress ran small, but as long as you look up the dress and go by the size chart it should be fine.

I wore it for a formal luncheon at a charity event. It was however, very restrictive. I typically wear a 00 or 0 and squeezed myself into the size 2. I'm 5'5"" and 115#. I was still able to fit with a strapless bra. The material is beautiful and heavy, but does not have any stretch!! Getting into a car is difficult, as well as going to the bathroom! It is too tight to pull up to use the restroom and has a hook-eye and zipper up the back. Thankfully, my mom was with me for the event and was my own personal attendant to go to the bathroom. I would not recommend if you do not have someone to help you in and out of it, or if you need to dance at a wedding. That being said, I was at a charity event and it worked perfectly for what I needed. I received so many compliments and it was very flattering. All in all, I would definitely rent it again!","April 2, 2019","Formal Affair"

I'm a pretty true to size 6 and the 8 was even a little snug. A bit hard to walk in especially with heels and honestly bathroom breaks were tough too.

I think I could have fit into the size down but was much more comfortable in the 2. The length was great, although getting in and out of cars was a little difficult, but for everything else it was great. I do kind of wish I could own this dress. I would definitely wear it again!","February 25, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS27","Sam","No such thing as too dressed up","I felt super glamorous in this dress. The cut and color are simple but stunning. It fit like a glove - a very tight glove that was made by vacuum-sealing the material to my hand. I would say this runs on the smaller side, and I'm glad I ordered the size up (a 4) as a backup. PROS: girl you will turn those heads SOME CONSIDERATIONS: 1. I am not a busty person, so I intermittently needed to adjust the top of the dress to keep my strapless bra covered. On the plus side, I finally had the posture my mom always wanted me to have because pushing my shoulders back helped keep the dress up. 2. The dress is tight and restricts your physical movements. Getting into my car was...interesting. I could not move my feet more than a foot apart. Dancing only worked because I love dancing and was committed. 3. I physically could not put on the dress or take it off by myself. I needed someone to come to the bathroom with me to help me undo the clasp in the back. I don't know if this is tmi, but I feel like this could be pertinent information for people who just don't got the time for that.","February 25, 2019","Wedding"

It was a struggle to get in and out of this dress (required the help of my husband) but I loved it. I wish the size 4 would have been available as a backup, but it wasn't available so I sucked it up (or in!) and had to avoid going up/down stairs... but overall a win.

It was the perfect blend of classy and sexy where I wanted to show off a little but be tasteful. Was grateful for the reviews that had me size up - I'm normally a 6 and the 8 fit perfectly - form fitting in the waist but just enough room to move around. I will say since the back slit is pretty low, I had some trouble with leg movement. Had to take steps slow and it was difficult to get into a high car. But the color, fabric, and cut were all lovely. Would definitely recommend and may rent this one again in the future.","January 8, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS27","RTR Customer","Sexy Christmas Party Dress for Hourglass Figures","Due to the fact I have a lot I'd like to say about this dress, I will make some pros and cons for you: Pros: -Rubber/non slip lining around neckline of the dress -Sexy cut for hourglass shapes -Compatible with a long torso -Accurate color depiction -There was room for my legs to move in the bottom of the dress. I didn't feel like I was bound together with fabric. -Looks great with heels (Nude or gold) and gold accessories -Shows of your boobs a bit. Not too much not to little. It was the perfect dress for my office party in downtown DC. Cons: -Not terribly easy to lift your arms -Insanely small (I wear a street size of 8 in dress (WHBM, Ann taylor). Had to wear the 12 in this dress) -Smashed my boobs down even after sizing up (I'm a 36D) -Small in the bust, a little blouse-y in the bottom/butt area -Zipper is a little slippery so it can be difficult to pull up -NO STRETCH TO THE FABRIC Size Reference: I wear a size 8 in pants and 10 in blouses at WHBM and Ann Taylor. My bust is a 36D, Natural Waist is 31. Height 5' 9"" Even with my cons added, these were not deal breakers for me. I came in prepared for all of those issues. Knowing that, I loved the dress. I got so many compliments. We went to a bar afterwards. I got such and ego boost from all the glances headed my way. I was a wonderful evening.

Pictures don't do this color justice. While I felt gorgeous wearing this dress, it was so restrictive in the arms and legs that I had trouble dancing. I joked that it was like wearing a straight jacket all evening. I love to dance at weddings so this was a problem for me! I did not wear a bra, but the dress fit snugly enough that it was OK.

Size 4 fit big, and long, making me look flat. I still wore it and I still felt beautiful but I know if I had worn a size two I would've looked better. The color is amazing! I got soooo many compliments, but it's a very restricting dress, even though it fit me big it was hard to walk in and also had to be very careful of my movements as to not flash anyone lol.","November 19, 2018","Party"

It had some stretch, hugged curves beautifully and kept a nice contoured shape. I have broader shoulders and (I suppose) bigger upper arms because it was very tight, but still wearable. Had to have someone come to the bathroom with me each time to help with the unzip/zipup. I love this dress! Would rent again. Would be interested to see how the size 10 would have fit.

I ended up wearing a 12R - I'm so glad I ordered up because the fabric isn't too forgiving. The dress is very flattering but the bust line is a little lower than I'm comfortable with (also my chest is significantly bigger being pregnant so it is what it is). I think if I had been able to wear the 10R or even an 8R, the neckline would've been fine (also not with an inflated chest).

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW274","RTR Customer","Dress was perfect for elegant awards ceremony that I attended.","I reviewed other's comments and noted it ran small, so I rented a 6R and an 8P as backup. I am generally between a 6 and 8 at stores (depends on the dress). At 5’2, however, dresses are almost always too long and I have to get them hemmed (petite clothes is sometimes too tight or fits awkward, so sizing can get tricky for me) so I was worried about the fit and length. The garment bag with two dresses arrived as scheduled. I was not able to zip up the 6R completely and at it was way too long for me. The 8P fit perfectly both in size and length and I wore it with 2-inch black heels. The dress was very flattering, a very nice thick material and comfortable (form fitting but stretchy enough to give me some room for steak dinner). I do not have an hourglass shape but this dress gave me curves in all the right places so I felt really pretty in it and my husband could not stop raving about how much he loved it and how great I looked in it. I went with a combination of pearls and bling for accessories and a black wrap. Although the dress is blue it is a very, very dark blue and can probably pass for black. I would definitely recommend this dress. This was my first time doing RTR and I'm certain that I will do it again.","January 14, 2019","Small"

Also showed off my bust quite a bit but multiple friends told me it wasn’t too much. (I asked a lot because I felt a little uncomfortable, so might be something to keep in mind if you’re more conservative.). The material was very comfortable.

It is very fitted, and I couldn't wear my spanks because it created a noticeable line where the spanks ended around my belly.

I never would have chosen it from the picture, but I felt classic and elegant in it, it was perfectly appropriate for the event. I thought it was really tight, but it's pretty stretchy, so it was comfortable. I'd say it runs small, but it gave me curves I don't really have!

I ordered 6R and 8R as my back up because it recommended ordering a size up as my back up dress. Wonderful gown, received several complements. I am 5' 5"" and was about 140ish pounds when I wore this gown. I think I wore about 2 and half inch heels with the dress and it fit perfectly. I am large busted, 32DD, so it definitely highlighted my chest but there was no slight so I thought that was ok. Overall, I would definitely rent this again if I had another important formal occasion to go to. The only thing I had an issue with, but I figured it would be an issue when I rented the dress because of the cap sleeves, is that it is hard to lift your arms up all the way due to the sleeves. But if you aren't a huge dancer then the arms thing won't bother you. But when I went to go dance I could raise my arms up all the way.","July 31, 2017","True to Size"

I definitely would have preferred a 10 though. I wore 3 inch heels to add to my 5'3 height and still struggled with a small 1/2 inch of extra material when going up or down stairs. At first I was really nervous because the neckline was more revealing than I anticipated, but, again, I became more comfortable with it throughout the day. I skipped the bra to avoid dealing with the lines and straps that showed. The dress also shows underwear lines so make sure to find a no-show pair! I really appreciated the cap sleeve which forced me to sit up straight!

I have a long torso and am 5'7"" so this was too short in the bodice and ended up flaring out higher than my waist. The 0 fit better but was even shorter in the bodice and length so i went with the 2. Comfortable and pretty easy to wear. Not flattering on me but this would be great to hide a belly or bulges. This is warm so it would make a great cold-weather dress. Got compliments on it but for me, there was no ""wow"" factor. Can wear a regular bra.","March 30, 2019","Wedding"

It was so flattering but also left room for my tummy to grow while eating dinner. :) It was so comfortable - I loved that I didn't need to worry about what kind of bra I was going to wear. I am pear shaped and this is not tight at all around the thighs, so it was super easy for me to wear. The only restriction I experienced was not being able to lift my arms up very high.

I ordered an 8 and a 10 which I considered standard sizing for me but the 10 was all that fit and really not without a deep breath to get it zipped. I went with no bra because it wasn't necessary, plus I didn't have the room. I'm 5'7 (just about), 150 lbs, and double D cup. I should have read the reviews better in deciding which size is best for me. I read a lot that said the arms were constricting but I didn't have any troubles. I chose this color based on the wedding colors (navy, gold and burgundy). I loved the dress so much. I received a lot of compliments on it throughout the night. If I had it to do over I would most definitely pick it again.","February 20, 2019","Small"

I originally ordered a size 0 and ended up wearing a size 2 just to have a little more space in my arms. Both fit very well and did exactly what I wanted for my figure. The fabric is a little ""thicker"" therefor allowing for any imperfections to be hidden by the beauty of the dress. The wedding I attended was at a ranch, outside in the humidity and this allowed me to breathe and yet be comfortable in the temperature changes. It was the best I have felt in a dress in a long time! Needless to say, LOTS of compliments!","February 3, 2019","Wedding"

I wore this to a wedding that was on the higher end of fancy that had a mixture of attires and felt great in it (and was told I looked great by lots of folks ;) ). I feel like this dress is one of those magical ones that at any event you wouldn't feel too dressed down or up. The shape was very flattering and most importantly, I could dance. Now to my bust warning- it's tight. I wear mostly size 6/medium dresses, but depending on the brand wear 8 sometimes and rarely ever a large (looking at you, Asian brands), and am an optimistic B cup. The 6 was a bust at the bust and I forwent a bra in the 8 to get a slight bit more room to breathe. It wasn't *un*comfortable, but I wanted to a least give a warning of consideration with those with larger chests.","December 12, 2018","Small"

The back kept bunching weird on the bottom but I had to wear it as the other dress was too worn. Otherwise great dress and if the bottom had been normal I would rent again.

It was a safe dress, but the neckline is definitely unique and it was overall very flattering. I got a few compliments on it. I usually wear a size 0. The smallest this dress comes in is a 2. It was very big for a 2- both in the bust and waist. I had to wear a super padded bra plus gel boobs. Ultimately my boobs were a C-D cup (I'm actually a 32A-B) just to fill the dress and make it fit right. The waist was a little loose too so I added a black belt on the day of the event which helped add more shape. It would have been ok without it, but I like to have dresses tight on my waist. The length was good and the slit in front was cute. I danced all night without it ever being uncomfortable.","April 5, 2017","Large"

The length was perfect for a short girl like me! I loved this dress, but it did seem like it had been worn quite a few times before me. the blue detailing is thread embroidery, and a piece or two was not fully tacked on.

I was kind of nervous about the slits on the side but they were the perfect size and not too revealing. The dress is super comfortable and flattering. Was also nervous about the size as I wear anything from an 8 to a 12 depending on the dress. I am big chested (34DDD), have a very short torso and am curvy but the 8 fit perfectly. With being only 5' 3"" the dress was a bit long but with heels with was fine and I only wore about 2-3 in heels. Would definitely recommend this dress!","May 16, 2017","Wedding"

I am 5'3""/145 lbs/34B+ with a small waist(not all the statistical info on the reviews I have read are honest) When I removed the dress from the package it was disappointing as it was more drab grey in daylight but in evening light it was LIQUID SILVER!!! The tailored flounces camouflaged my 67 year old tummy. The length of the asymetrical hem was a designer bonus.

Once I tried it on, I got over that quickly. It hangs beautifully and looked fabulous. I was mildly overdressed for my department's residency graduation, which I anticipated beforehand, but the dress was tasteful and didn't feel out of place. NOTE: I wore a 4 and ordered my backup size in a 6 as some reviews suggested. The 4 was so much too large that I almost didn't wear it, but I didn't have anything else to wear, so I wore a thick adhesive bra AND supplemented further to keep it from falling down.

This dress was my first choice, but outside my price range, so I picked a different dress. The dress I ordered came back damaged from the previous renter so RTR contacted me and offered me another dress up to double the price that they would overnight to me.

With some stretch in the fabric and a fitted bust, this dress is would work best with smaller cup sizes. This dress is fitted at the waist, but not in the hip area, so it allows for comfortable movement. One thing that I love about this dress is the metallic color and the asymmetrical hem. At 36” from shoulder to hem, this dress is perfect to wear for any formal event, like a wedding or gala. Pair it with silver or gold jewelry and heels to make for a stunning look.","November 4, 2016","True to Size"

It was the most unique dress at the event. The dress is more of a warm silver so black accessories looked best. I wore the suggested ""rustic evening earrings"" and they looked fabulous with the dress. The pattern on the fabric is more pronounced than it looks in the photo on the model.

I feel like I didn't have to add any accessories besides earrings because the dress looked formal and elegant itself. The fabric had a very slinky/clingy feel to it especially around the midsection, so spanx will be your best friend.","January 25, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMU63","Courtney","Really beautiful dress","Rented this for a friend's wedding. I'm 5'6 and 130 lbs and I wore the medium - I almost could have worn the small but would have been uncomfortable after dinner since there's basically no stretch. The fabric/flow/movement of this dress is beautiful - made the length tasteful and not frumpy. The cut was definitely low but for me that balanced out the length. I did get a spot of hairspray on the front as I was getting ready and that stuck around all night looking like a waterspot so this material doesn't really hide spots well. Everything else was great though, would recommend!","January 8, 2019","Wedding"

If youre smaller in bust like me, sticky bra helped immensely as there is no support/padding built in. The material was thinner than I anticipated (lined, but very thin), but made it very comfortable. Paired with strappy nude heels and dangle earrings - worked out great!","October 2, 2018","Wedding"

It's very comfortable, super flattering and classy. I did think it ran slightly big – I'm 27 weeks pregnant, 5'8"" and 160 lbs pre-pregnancy (probably gained about 15 pounds by this point) but I have a smaller bust (36B) and felt the Large was too big on top. I usually size up for my hips/thighs/booties, so maybe a Medium wouldn't have worked anyway, but it was stretchy. I agree with other reviewers that the arm holes/sleeves are too big, but it did lay flat nicely for photos and was fine throughout the night aside from dancing. :) Rent it, you won't regret it!","January 2, 2020","Large"

It really is quite pretty on and is very light weight and perfect for hot weather. I normally wear a 2/xs. This dress fit great with one caveat. I felt like the straps were too short for my chest. They are adjustable but were difficult to manipulate and I was afraid I might break them. You don't necessarily need a bra with this style but I felt more comfortable in one because the chest area was so much higher than mine. I felt like the chest was more appropriate for a shorter girl.

I knew the dress would be too long for me (and with 3 inch heels, it dragged the floor by 2 inches). While snug in the hips- the top felt loose and gaping. I was wearing a strapless bra in the photo- but the top still felt really loose.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR10","Tyler","Beautiful pink color and details","Pros and cons: Tight around the rib cage. I'm a 36DD and barely fit in the 10. I am typically an 8. I ordered an 8 and 10. Should have ordered up with the 12. But no bra was needed because it was so tight. Great color and it looked great with a Hollywood glam look added with red lipstick. The details on the shoulders were pretty but most of the large sequins were missing. You couldn't tell much because they are a pewter color and blended with the other sequins. I did notice that one dress had a small slit in the back while the other had a long one, most likely someone ripped it previously. My undies would have surely shown if I bent over. Luckily I was headed to a work holiday party where I'd be standing or sitting in a chair most of the night. Also there was a hole in the side of the waist, nothing a safety pin couldn't fix temporarily. Be aware there is a reason why some of these dresses are discounted so much. Wouldn't rent again but I did get a lot of compliments. And for the price it was a nice dress.","December 24, 2017","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR10","Chris","I FELT LIKE A BALLERINA","This dress was actually my 'backup' style for a wedding! I ordered a size 2 last minute, though I normally wear a 0. Most other renters reported that the dress was too small, so I went a size up. While it was definitely formal for the occasion with some bagginess in the torso/chest area, I would have preferred a closer (and more flattering) fit and would definitely rent the 0 next time. The clasp at the top of the back zipper was warped, but this had no effect on closure. Skirt pleats were gorg, and the skirt itself hit just above the knee (again, perfect for the formal nature of the wedding). The dress is a gorgeous ballet slipper pink, and I managed to match a pair of pink kitten heels with it, now that millenial pink is all the rage.","November 13, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR10","Taryn","Pretty in Pink","This dress was beautiful and elegant. The dress was just a bit challenging to get on if you are curvy due to a petite waistline. I usually wear a size 2. I ended up wearing the 4 instead of the 2 for comfort when sitting. It fit well and the shoulders gave it the glam factor. Overall, I received many compliments and I had a great time in this dress!","September 30, 2017","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR10","Sydney","I received compliments all night long for this dress! It's a perfect mix of a classy and sparkle","I really love this dress but wish I had requested another size up. I'm currently between a 6-8 and the 10 fit but was tight on my waist the entire evening. I also read about issues with the bottom being tight, but the dress I wore had a hemmed slit part way up the back of the dress while my backup size didn't, so I'm not sure if someone else had previously ripped it. This dress really is a beautiful shimmery pink and the shoulder bead detail is the perfect amount of sparkly without being gaudy. I would totally recommend it, just be sure to order a few sizes up for a backup size!","September 4, 2017","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR10","Morgan","A gorgeous dress - but runs super small!","This dress is stunning in person. The fabric, the seaming, the details are all really beautiful and very well made, but the other reviewers are right - this dress runs small! I got it to wear to a black tie wedding and the style ended up being perfect, but both sizes had issues. I ordered a 4 and a 6, expecting to wear the larger size, however, the dress appeared to have been repaired and was sewed together slightly above where the zipper ended, making it nearly impossible to get over my hips. The 4 was slightly tighter through the ribcage, but fit better around the shoulders and was much less of a struggle to pull up over my hips. While the images of the dress show it as super mini, it fits much longer on a petite build. I'm barely 5 feet tall and the dress hit my knees. The dress is also tight around the legs, so use caution when sitting and dancing. I would definitely rent it again and even consider purchasing it so I could alter it to fit perfectly. The only reason I gave it four stars was due to fit.","August 29, 2017","Small"

I didn't like a previous dress I ordered, so RTR sent me this dress in two sizes overnight for an additional $25. Great deal! Got many compliments on the dress. It runs a bit small, especially in the ribcage, so size up 1 to 2 sizes to be safe.","August 17, 2017","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR10","Kelly","Tight fit but got lots of compliments and matched the other bridesmaids dresses.","This is a beautiful dress but the fit was really tight on me. I usually wear a 6 and barely got into the 8! Once it was on it was very flattering and I liked the hourglass shape it gave me. The cap sleeves are gorgeous but a little restrictive on moving your arms above your head. And the bubble skirt also looks great but does come in a little tight around the thighs. Makes it difficult to bend down and pick something up or dance a lot. I ended up changing into a more comfortable dress for the end of the night dancing, but I'm really glad I had this dress for the ceremony and photos. It was a huge hit and I felt beautiful in it. And it would be perfect for a non-dancing event.","July 5, 2017","Small"

The fit is good but it is tighter in the waist. I actually wore my backup size which was the size 4. It was difficult to get on but once it was on it fit really well. The size 2 was too small! The 4 fit great. It does ride up a bit when you sit down but if you are careful it isn't a problem. I wore it to an evening wedding and was able to dance in it.

I loved the quality of the material and the beautiful petal pink color, and the beading on the shoulders was the perfect tough of edge. The only downside was that the waist of this dress is VERY small. I usually wear a size 12 but got a 14 as well because I read that this was the case, but I would have liked to have a 16 if that was possible, it was so tight! Beautiful dress, just make sure to size up!","March 26, 2017","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR10","RTR Customer","Snug in certain places","All the reviews are pretty accurate this dress definitely runs small specifically in the waist and legs but has more room in the chest and hip area (once you get the smaller parts over your hips). I opted for the 6 because the 4 was too uncomfortable in the waist and hard to sit in. It's very understated but pretty. Would definitely recommend! Just make sure you get a size up for your backup size or maybe even two depending on your body type.","March 3, 2017","Wedding"

Fit was great, except for I realized when I was wearing it that it was a little less than ideal for three reasons 1) I have bigger boobs and so used sticky pads, and the dress didn't offer much support so I felt like I had to keep adjusting to keep my boobs lifted and away from the cut out on the chest 2) the off the shoulder style did make it a little uncomfortable to dance in, 3) the fabric on the slit had a weird bend from previous wearers (I couldn't manage to iron it away), so it didn't lie flat but instead was weirdly sitting. Despite these things, the dress looked fantastic on, was a really flattering and perfect color for fall, and I have no regrets with my choice.","June 26, 2019","Wedding"

While the black slip hugged my body well (a good balance between loose & tight), the dress itself was a little loose BUT in a good way! I think it would look odd if it was more form fitting. I can definitely see this paired with a belt but I think a cropped or fitted jacket over it works well too which is how I styled it. With my petite size, it fell slightly above my ankles. I styled these with ankle booties.","January 4, 2019","Everyday"

I planned to order the medium and large (backup size) but by the time I placed my order the large wasn't available. Because I had read so many reviews, I felt OK just going with the medium. Because the zipper is on the side, I struggled to get the few inches beside my bust zipped myself (had to have the hubs help with that). Once it was on and zipped, it looked fantastic, no one would have said it was too tight and it felt grippy in a good way, like it was helping me stand taller. The reason I loved this dress and would recommend is because it is the kind of dress that makes a statement without standing out. You look amazing but people still see you. I was officiating a wedding, so while I wanted to look and feel good, I didn't want to draw too much attention to myself (and away from the bride) with prints or colors but I also didn't want to feel frumpy or dreary.

It was perfect for all the running around I had to do; I was able to wear a regular bra and felt comfortable the whole night. The only thing that bothered me was that the zipper was on the side of the dress, rather than the back, so the inevitable buckling that happens along the zipper line disrupted the smooth line of the waist- I'm sure it's something only I noticed but I felt the need to double check that the dress was pulled down snug on that side before any pictures.","November 16, 2017","Formal Affair"

It's very body hugging, but the fabric kind of acts like Spanx, sucking you in! The flared bottom is a nice little twist on a simple long black dress.","September 2, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/OC54","Amanda","Great for a black tie wedding","Tight dress but pretty forgiving and incredibly comfortable. I'm tall so the length was great with heels. Easy to move in and always a plus being able to wear a normal bra. The texture adds a unique touch to an otherwise very classic black dress. Dress came in great condition so no cons with my experience.","July 6, 2017","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/OC54","Laurie","Compliments Galore!!","The dress is stretchy and very form fitting, so comfortable to move and sit in and very easy to wear. You can use a regular bra but you might want to opt for shape wear because the dress shows every bump and curve unless you are really thin. The one design flaw with this dress is that the zipper is located on the side of the dress. Since the fabric is very stretchy and soft and the zipper is stiff and inflexible, the zipper buckled along the side of the dress when I moved instead of lying smoothly along the side of the body. I used a wide belt which hid this noticeable fit issue. I gave the rating 4 stars because of zipper issue. I would otherwise highly recommend the dress because it is very sexy,so flattering and extremely comfortable. I received compliment all day about a gorgeous dress!!! Someone told me I should buy it!!","June 26, 2017","True to Size"

I was nervous because it was a big night and I was unsure of how it would fit. I was so happy when I put the first dress on! It fit like it was made for me. This is probably my absolute most favorite dress I have ever worn! The texture and the sheen of the dress made it look so sexy, but also very classy. It had a little bit of stretch so it hugged in all the right places, but the material was thick enough that you can wear a regular bra and panties and not worry about panty lines showing. Really, I could not be happier with this experience!","May 25, 2017","Formal Affair"

I called into the RTR customer service line and was met with a very nice young man that went through the filters of available dresses in my sizes that could be overnighted to me, he added them as ""favorites"" to my account so I could easily see them in the RTR app, and stayed on the phone with me until I chose one. He was very patient, truly concerned and extremely helpful. I received this dresses the next day and I think this style was even better than the original I ordered.

The material is thicker than I thought it would be, which actually made it perfect for an outdoor wedding in October.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW650","Wendy","Cute and comfortable!","I really loved this dress and would consider buying it. It was less formal in person than in the pictures as the fabric was a soft cotton. I wore it to work with a jean jacket, which may have been a little casual for being a middle-aged woman but I got a bunch of compliments. The elastic ruching around the waist was really comfortable. Only issue for me was the lining of the dress is a couple inches shorter than the outside fabric so dress felt a little short on me simply because I knew you could see the difference between the layers. Overall, great dress!","June 5, 2019","True to Size"

I was worried about the slits on the side causing back fat but the material was stretchy enough that it wasn't an issue. The slit in the back helps with movement for dancing as well. I am 5'10 and the 6L was perfect with heels. I'm a 36C bust and was able to wear a bra that stayed hidden. Bra is probably not necessary but I wanted to fill out the top nicely.

The length was ok, but would've been better had I gone with the long option, I'm 5'7"" with a short torso/long legs and was originally planning on wearing a shorter heel but changed my mind at the last minute to a 3.5"" inch black, block heel. Tons of compliments, especially from my date - nobody ever picks this gem of a color (it really is like a jewel royal purple color!) - looked amazing in pictures and in person among a sea of black/navy dresses at the formal wedding I attended.

I was able to wear a regular bra so there was no hassle of a strapless or sticky bra. The color would be pretty on any skin tone. It was incredibly comfortable. I could dance in it easily. Cons: Even with the 6L, the dress didnt touch the floor. I am 5'8"" and wore 1 1\2 inch heels. If you're tall and want something that hits the floor, this may not be your first pick. It runs small. Normally I wear a 4 (was too tight). The 6 was even a bit snug. I probably should have ordered a 6 & an 8 as my backup size. Overall I would recommend this dress to anyone!

I recommend trying not to wear any shapewear or undergarments because there could be lines. I did wear a sticky bra which was helpful. Only complaint was the lining flipping up on the neckline part that goes toward your armpit (opposite the strap on the shoulder) since it is not fully lined which totally may have been fixed with dress tape.

What i didn't like: it runs small, i wore the larger of the two sizes and still felt stuffed in it a little. The cut of the top is slightly weird, I'm also very busty (also nursing so this fluctuates during the day) and while I didn't fear reveal, i felt it could have come higher under my armpit.

The fabric is very lightweight and the bright colors bring out the dress! The dress is loose and roomy all around and the high neckline is not uncomfortable. I would advise to wear either a strapless bra or nubra due to the halter neck. At 5'6 and a half, the dress comes right to my calf. Overall, the dress is a perfect summer style and can be worn on any occasion.","May 30, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TT239","Andrea","Beautiful colors, perfect for spring!","I am either a medium or large in most dresses and wore the medium in this one. The tie in the large seemed twisted, making it fit a little tighter in the top. The medium fit perfectly. I wore a belt to accentuate my waist, but I could have gone without and been just fine. A strapless bra worked perfectly with this dress. The dress is light and super comfortable. The colors are bright and fun and perfect for spring! I wore the dress to a Derby Day party.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/STS62","Amy","Compliments all night long","I rented this dress for a wedding in Texas. For sizing, I ordered a small with a medium as backup. I'm in between a small and medium in most clothes, but the small was pretty roomy on me, so I went with that size for the event. I didn't even try on the medium. In regards to the dress itself, it was a little closer to bubblegum pink than the online picture (see my photo for a more accurate take), which was fine for me but could be a problem for those wanting the blush color. I also think this dress's lace overlay is a little more fun than regular lace - almost like a crochet effect. It also feels like crochet and is thicker but doesn't restrict movement. I wore a normal bra/underwear, but I realized part way through the night that you could see my straps through the lace on the shoulder. Oh well! Overall, I got lots of compliments on this dress (my family now just asks ""Rent the Runway again?"" and I say ""yep!""). I would highly recommend it.","October 28, 2018","Large"

The only downside was that the area around the middle was tighter than the other material & it kind of made it look like it was cutting me off and showing fat above & below, but it was just material bunching up above & below.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend ordering your regular size for your primary size. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. Curvier women may consider sizing up for full hips. It works for all cup sizes but you should wear a strapless bra because of the sheer lace detail at the top. At 5'3 the length hit knee length on me. I adore how girly and feminine this style is. Pair it with a cute little clutch and heels and you are ready for date night!","June 2, 2018","True to Size"

Perhaps I should have ordered a small rather than xs. Nice length for me at 5'2 (appropriate for work) and I can see this working well for a day time event as well (bridal showers etc). Lastly, I only gave this dress 4 stars because of the color. It's not a subtle blush color like the picture but more of a girly pink color, which to me took away some of the elegance. Nevertheless it's a beautiful dress and I would recommend renting once.","May 16, 2018","Work"

I liked the heaviness of the fabric for that purpose, but would not recommend for a hot summer day. The low v is sexy yet comfortable and no need to wear a bra. No undergarments show through. However I did find the color to be a rather ugly grey-ish white, whether from too many washings or if that's how it's supposed to be, it was a little dingy and made it seem old/used. Fits true to size, like every RTR piece the zipper is hard to use and gets stuck.","February 6, 2020","Party"

I had a baby a few months ago so I wasn't sure what size I was or if this was designer or commercial sizing. After talking to a stylist, I chose this because it was commercial sizing. I chose the 6 because I wanted to be safe - well it was amazing. The fabric is thick and forgiving. I could've worn a 4 and been very comfy but the 6 was just fine. The deep V didn't allow for a bra and that was okay - I felt confident and covered. Regular undies can be worn without concern. The length was great just above my knee. Love the industrial zipper and high back. The cap sleeves are current but classic and a great alternative to sleeveless.

However, it's extremely difficult to button. The buttons lay against your skin, on your waist, so it's really hard to reach underneath the dress to pull the buttons through. They're also kind of small and very flat and slippery. So they're even more difficult to grasp. The third time I wore it I had false nails put on, nothing very long, but even the additional bulk of the nails made me give up on trying to button the dress. I just tied it tightly and hoped for the best.","May 9, 2018","Everyday"

I have a larger (38DD) bust/chest though. A smaller cup size may not require. Also, went up to a 14R because of my chest but if it were about a 1/4 inch smaller or opted for no bra I could have worn my regular size 12R.

I would be raving about this dress and how flattering it was (gave me something close to an hourglass shape which is a miracle) EXCEPT for two big flaws: it's really low cut, and I didn't realize until too late that my bra was showing all night. I think the only way around this is those stick-on bras that don't meet in the middle. Also, my dress had a clump of fabric at the base of the zipper that I could not smooth down. Maybe it was just the particular ress I had, or maybe I just couldn't figure out how to smooth the frabric, but anyway I attached a picture you can kind of see the clump of fabric.

However, I wish I had sized down as I found the dress a little large, but still wearable, in my normal size 4 (5'8"" and 130 lbs). I would like to have been able to try on the smaller size. The yellow was a great color, perfect for a summer late afternoon wedding. Tips: I wore a normal bra and used tape to pull the straps in the front closer together so they did not show (the armholes are cut wide on the front of the dress). The bra straps did not show in the back at all without any extra work. I also had to fish through my shapewear to find spanx that did not have a seam up the front, because anything with a front seam showed through. I wore it with a sparkly statement necklace and nude heeled sandals.","May 30, 2018","Large"

Beyond that I found the neckline to be a bit choking and that was uncomfortable. Ultimately I knew attempting to wear this would be a nightmare for me in reality.

I'd say if you are a true petite 0 or 00 this might not be the dress for you as it fit me well and it might be a little too roomy for many ladies I know who are smaller than I. I was also worried about the back gapping but it actually laid quite nicely throughout the evening without using any sticky tape. The material is thick so the right person might be able to get away without a bra. My nipples always shine through so I opted for a sticky bra which did just the trick. The back really is the perfect surprise element on this otherwise-conservative silhouette. Received so many compliments! Also, I am mid-30's and trending away from the super short mini-dresses so this style hitting a few inches above the knee was just perfect for me!","December 18, 2018","Party"

The dress is a beautiful color and the material is structured and high quality. From the front it looked amazing on me. But the dress is totally backless and it would not allow me to wear a bra. I'm a 36DD so I can't go braves and the idea of contorting myself into some low back crisscross bra did not seem comfortable. I tried to wear a body suit under it but that did not work either. The only other thing is that while the zipper was a bit hard to get up the open area gaped and was too large on me. I suspect it's because I'm petite and have no shoulders.","September 9, 2019","Party"

The only reason I give it a 4/5 is because it was a bit big up top for me.

It seemed to be stuck at the middle. I think the size would have been good once it was zipped but the zipper just wasn't working. Was thinking about trying a size up, but they didn't have it available. I also think the size up would have looked too big overall.","October 11, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RZ65","Mo","Pretty with a tough zipper","I enjoyed wearing the top. I think it was flattering. Though if you are larger than a D cup, the fit might be a problem for you. The layering tank did not have adjustable straps so I had to stabilize the tank after I zipped so the ain't band would hold it up high enough. The zipper was tough and I could not do it alone. I wore this went to see my bestie so she could zip me in and out of it so you might want to have an extra hand around for the zipper. The top did have bra strap holders. I didn't use them because one was missing when I received the top (would not have helped with the strap anyway). Overall, I did enjoy the top.","October 10, 2018","Other"

With that being said, I'm 5 months pregnant and have a much larger bust (36DDD) than normal(34D). Plenty of double sided tape used! The previous renter did not return in the second size option I ordered and I wore my regular size while 5 months pregnant. There was enough stretch to the dress to accommodate the bigger belly and the fabric is of great thick quality to keep things smooth. Overall, a great dress!","March 20, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA258","Kylie","Great dress for formal event!","This dress is amazing but not for the faint of heart. The front slit came to about mid thigh for me and I'm 5'9, so definitely recommend having a pashmina for covering up when seated. I went based on other reviews and sized up. I'm typically a 4 or 6, depending on the brand, but got the 8 in this dress and was very happy. Tall ladies - the 8L was long everywhere, not just the hem in my experience. I felt the top was baggy and ultimately went with the 8R even though it was short with heels. I tried fashion tape and wanted the 8L to work but didn't want to risk it! I found this dress was compatible with a ""sticky bra"" with no issues. Received tons of compliments and felt great in it all night!","March 3, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA258","Kimber","Bump friendly! I'm 32 weeks pregnant and this dress was still glamorous!","Pregnant ladies, this is your dress! A size up wasn't an option so I rented my normal size 2. I'm on the short side at 5'2"" and typically not curvy. Right now, I'm 32 weeks pregnant and have pretty much only gained a bump so I was able to squeeze into it. I wish I had one size bigger to accommodate the eating I wanted to do, but the dress was beautiful and made me feel like I wasn't a dumpy pregnant lady at a black tie wedding. The slit in front is high. The cape covers most of your bootie so I didn't even worry about shape wear.","February 25, 2019","Wedding"

The fit was exactly true to size. I am 6'1' and the long wasn't as long as I hoped but really, nothing is. The length came to a good spot so it wasn't an issue. The cape sleeves are a unique feature and help create drama but still let you be covered up a bit. The neckline is really flattering and allows for some fun cleavage to be accentuated.","January 2, 2019","True to Size"

It was very comfortable, the color is gorgeous and it's different enough to make a statement without being over the top. I didn't need to wear a bra with it but did use some fashion tape just to make sure there were no incidents. Also the slit in the front does cause you to show a lot of leg if sitting cross legged, but I didn't find it to be a problem. I got compliments all night long!","November 21, 2018","True to Size"

The color was really pretty for my Spring event and would look good in the Fall as well since it is a deep red and is made with a little thicker fabric.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HA258","Melanie","Perfect Red Dress for an Evening Wedding","This dress was a hit! I got so many compliments on the color and the style. The deep neckline was sexy, but elegant, and the cape was very flattering. I did wear a body-shaping slip underneath since I am newly postpartum and have a soft mommy-tummy, but I felt confident and comfortable in the dress all night long. I chose not to wear any type of bra or pastey on the girls, and the dress stayed put, even through dancing. I am 5'6"" and wore 2-inch heels and the dress hit just above the ground. I feel like this is a sisterhood of the traveling pants type of dress - it looks good on every body shape! The only downside I can drum up is that the slit is a little higher than I would prefer. That being said, I would wear this dress again and recommend it for anyone who needs a classy dress with a little bit of flair.","April 4, 2018","True to Size"

I hoped to order a size up, but since it was not available I went with the 4L. I typically wear a dress size 4 so I was pretty nervous about the fit. I was pleasantly surprised when I could actually zip this dress up! Not only was it flattering to my belly, the color and cut is simply perfection. I received compliments all night long and felt absolutely beautiful wearing this stunner. It is sleek, modern, chic and somehow timeless all in one. Pregnant mamas - this is the evening dress for you! I may have been slightly more comfortable in a size up; however, the Long length helped keep the front slip from riding too high up (as other pregnant reviewers mentioned).

Subtlety hid my arms without actually having sleeves, and showed just enough leg without making me feel self conscious. Not gonna lie though, the slit is HIGH when you sit down so definitely keep that in mind. I also probably would've been more comfortable in the 16 as the 14 was pretty tight in the hips/tummy.

Running true to size with some stretch in the midsection, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going a size up for your back-up. This style is comfortable throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works best for A - C cups sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this romper so you should wear a strapless bra due to the spaghetti straps. At 5'5, the length hit mid-thigh on me. This rippling ruffle adds to the summertime appeal of this ready-for-anything romper. I would recommend pairing this with large earrings to accent the ruffles.","June 8, 2018","True to Size"

I'm usually between sizes so I wasn't super Shocked when the 8 was tight on the hips and fit my bust perfectly. The 10 was just fine though and didn't show too much boob (until I wanted it too). The petite length was perfect for my 5'4"" self in 2/3"" heels. If you're taller or planning on wearing higher heels definitely get the regular. It would've been fine for me in my usual choice of heels, but it was safe as formal was on a boat and I definitely would've tripped if the gown was longer. Overall this dress was AMAZING for a chilly boat prom. The fabric was thick enough to keep me warm from wind and also looked gorgeous in the breeze. My boyfriend couldn't keep his hands off me. 11/10 would rent again.","April 20, 2018",""

My measurements are 33-26-35, and the 0 fit very well. I had some extra room, but it didn't look too big. It's a shift dress, not a pencil dress, there's no stretch and no slit, so if it were tighter it wouldn't have been comfortable. I had no trouble walking in it, but I had to pull it up a little to go up or down stairs. There are extra layers of fabric in the bust so I went without a bra easily. I could have worn a padded strapless bra to fill it out a little more and give it a little shape. The body of the dress is a little sheer, but was fine with nude no-show underwear.

It does have pockets, but they are very shallow and I wouldn't rely too much on them.

But it did stay put and worked well. Pre pregnancy, I wear small/ size 4. I am 35 weeks pregnant and the small fit me perfectly, so it may seem that it runs a little larger. Word of caution to short ladies. This dress is LONG. It worked well for the shoot as I didnt want to wear heels and it covered my feet with a trail of dress. But for the party, it was a bit of a pain as I didnt wear shoes inside the house. I ended up rubber banding/bustling it at one point just so I could walk.

I usually wear a 0 and that's what I'm wearing in the photo. Waist was snug but not too tight, and even then I'm only 5'0"" no hemming tape needed because I could wear it as a full length dress. Loved its uniqueness. Biggest issue was how they cut the cleavage. Because it's cut more like a U instead of a V it gapes out to the sides terribly. Fashion tape would couldnt hold it. Maybe a size 2 would have given me extra room in the chest but the cut would have still been super wide. I have a 32-D chest. If it had not been affiliated with work I may have still worn it but for this I was afraid I'd flash a nipple on the dance floor.","January 12, 2019","Formal Affair"

The fit was true to size and I loved the length of the skirt and where it fell on my long-legged 5'9"" frame. Only 'meh' feeling about the dress was that it was a bit 'hippy'. Not peace and love hippie. But rather, too much pleated material on the skirt, causing my hips to look much wider than actuality. Now that said, pretty sure no one was looking at my hips!! (LOL!!)

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NLS76","Margo","Fabulous Dress!","I rented this dress for a 6p Saturday wedding that was ""cocktail"" attire at a Castle. I got it as a back up dress for another event in May so I knew what to expect going in. I typically wear a 10R. Because of the cut of this dress (the plunge neckline) I opted for the 8R. I am bigger at the hips/thighs so it was a little snug there, but the top held in tight and comfortable. With the lace overlay, the snugness of the underneath lining didn't really matter. I did tape the girls down mostly to try and keep them a little lifted. I wore it with a light/copper/beaded heel, longer dangly earrings and no necklace. I think too much around the neck takes away from the deep neckline. Also - not sure what they've done - but the zipper was a non-issue! And when I tried it back in May, it was! I had my 22 y.o. daughter on hand to zip me, but my husband got it right up - no problem. I am very likely to rent this again - it's a great dress. I received a ton of compliments.","August 19, 2018","Wedding"

It's a bit edgy/different than my usual wedding guest style so not sure I would've rented it under a different circumstance but ended up loving it!! I got SO many compliments before and after the wedding. However, ** if you are small chested this dress will be huge on top**. I'm a 34B and had to tape down the front of the dress & pin up the top fabric to make it fit my chest. I'm usually a 4/6 so this sizing was correct, just not up top. If you're willing to adjust it at bit, worth it, but keep that in mind when renting.","August 8, 2018","Wedding"

I usually wear a 12 in dresses, but the tighter fit of the 10 helped keep the girls up without a bra (though I did use a LOT of Hollywood tape). I don't usually show much in the way of cleavage, but this dress allowed for a little sass without ever feeling exposed. I'm hippier, so the smaller size was a little tighter in that area, but I was able to sit and dance fine, which is why I said it runs a little large. I love the midi overlay - so flattering. It's hard to tell, but this dress does have a slight peplum in the overlay, which I didn't love, but overall didn't make a huge difference.","April 6, 2018","Large"

The size 8 was super tight at the ribs and blouse-y with the deep plunge so that I would have needed to pin or tape the top down. The L was super long compared to other L dresses I've ordered from here so you'll need platform or Higher heels if your 5'9"" or under.

It can be worn with a standard bra, which is a plus! If you have a smaller bust, fashion tape would be a good idea to keep the top down. Especially with the plunging neckline! The rectangular piece right below the bust is thicker, and didn't lay flat - but going down a size will fix that. Perfect for a Fall or Winter wedding! Gold jewelry will accent the green as well!","September 22, 2016","Large"

I'm usually a perfect American size 4, so I was surprised that this dress did not fit. The bodice was too tight, and the zipper wouldn't zip up all the way. I have an athletic frame, with relatively wide shoulders and ribcage for my 34A chest. The dress was beautifully made and the fabric was gorgeous . . . very lux, despite the absence of ornament. The sculptural details at the shoulders and waist were lovely, and I think this gown would be a great option for those with slightly narrower shoulders or torsos! Happily, I ordered another style as a back-up, and that size 2 fit perfectly. So, if in doubt, be sure to order a backup size or style.","October 19, 2019","Small"

Danced & looked great for hours!","July 9, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CVN25","RTR Customer","Didn't end up wearing - too tight & too deep","The color is gorgeous but the dress itself is hard to get on (side zipper) so if you're planning to wear this, do your makeup AFTER you get into this dress. The chest portion is low, and I was expecting this, but I wasn't expecting the dress cut in the front to be close to the bottom of my sternum! The length was great for a petite girl but I ended up not wearing this dress because it wasn't super comfortable and the front slit didn't suit me.","April 25, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CVN25","RTR Customer","Beautiful dress, best for longer torsos.","I rented this for an outdoor wedding that I was in. The dress was beautiful, and I really liked the dark green color. The neckline is quite low, so I ended up using double-sided tape to make sure I didn't accidentally flash someone. This dress would probably work better on someone who is taller and who has a longer torso, as it wouldn't quite lay flat on me and give me good coverage at the same time. I wore 3"" wedges, but still had to lift the dress whenever I walked. Would rent again in a jam, but wish there was a petite version.","March 17, 2019","True to Size"

I wore this for a black tie gala that I was attending with colleagues and industry people. Sometimes I feel like it's hard to find a dress that feels glamorous but still conservative/appropriate enough for a professional work setting. This dress hit the mark. Perfect neckline, beautiful color and fit, and very comfortable (with pockets!) I would definitely recommend and wear it again myself.","January 14, 2019","True to Size"

The pockets were a plus! I'm tall (5'10"") and appreciated the longer size available - it wasn't too long and gave me the much needed couple of inches to wear heels. The cut also gave me a nice waistline. I'm flat chested and had some trouble with the bust, but a little double sided tape did the trick. The neckline doesn't accommodate a bra, so be prepared to go without. Beautiful dress.","November 26, 2018","True to Size"

The bell sleeves and the drama of the lace and the fun full skirt made it a perfect pick for the night. I had to wear the 10 because the 8 wouldn't come close to zipping due to my chest area.

I really liked the lace detail and bell sleeves. The weight is a tad heavy, but it didn't bother me much other than making me feel hot for parts of the evening. My only complaint (and it's minor) is that I wish the gold lining underneath looked more gold. Most people thought it was white lining and I wanted it to really pop as black and gold. Overall, I was very pleased with the dress and received many compliments. I definitely recommend it!","September 28, 2017","True to Size"

The slip underneath was a champagne color and the lace was a heavy lace, but still breathable. The ONLY thing that was really irritating about this dress was that the dress rubbed the base of my neck really bad. But I came up with a solution before I had to wear it & ended up putting a band aid right where the dress hit my neck & you couldn't even tell. Also, I do have a small chest & I felt the 2 was rather tight for having such a small chest. The dress does not stretch at all, so I couldn't really lift my arms up too high either.","October 22, 2016","Wedding"

I wore Spanx underneath to smooth as much as possible and I didn't need to bra which was a HUGE plus. I've gained some weight the past few months but I felt like this dress was made for curvy girls! The color is more beautiful in person and the length was perfect with heels. I wasn't wearing them in this picture so it gave it a bit of a train, I'm 5'3. Although, the stitching on the one strap was coming out and the side boning kept poking me I recommend this dress! I can't wait for my next big event. Get the dress!

I was worried about how that would look since I'm almost 5""3. The heels that I wore with it were about 3.5 inches. The only con was that it was a teeeny tiny bit snug around the stomach but if you wear shape wear, you'll be fine. Overall, I was extremely happy with this dress and Rent the Runway.

It's absolutely gorgeous, the slit (not seen here) is perfect, the one shoulder strap detail gives it a real wow factor. People could not stop complimenting the cut and the color. I normally wouldn't pick something so form fitting because I can be a bit curvier in the hip area, and it ran true to size and the material has some give. In fact, that's about the only thing that deterred me from wearing the size 12 I ordered, just so I wouldn't be too self conscious all night.

I used hem tape to shorten it for the night because I need to wear a shorter heel (no more than 2"") when I perform. Bottom line, if you are on the petite side and need to wear shorter heels, then use some hem tape! So easy!

But once it was zipped (needed some help) it was perfect. Felt custom made. The fabric has just the right amount of give. I was completely comfortable all night....danced for hours. No tugging and adjusting. The length was just right with 4 inch heels. I'm about 5'7"" and if I wore anything less than 4 in heels it would have been too long.

I'm 5'6"", 140 lbs, 34B, with an athletic build-- broad shoulders and a wide ribcage. I ordered a 6R and 8R as the 4 wasn't available. I probably needed the size 4... the bust area was a bit loose, making the dress droop slightly up top and feel a bit heavy, but it was still fine to wear. I probably could have put on a strapless bra if I was really looking to solve the drooping problem. I wore ~4 inch heels for the night which made the hem hit perfectly.

It was a tad longer than expected -- Im 5'8"" and wore 4"" heels and the 2L was still sweeping the ground. I also stepped on the hem a few times. I kind of liked that, though.

It runs true to size, but we recommend sizing up for backup if you're curvier, and sizing down if you are smaller framed. This one-shoulder dress is extremely comfortable. I didn't even have to wear a bra because the material is thick and stretchy, so a bra is not necessary. I wore short nude heels, which is why the dress looks a little long, but it wasn't a problem at all. It has a knee-high slit in the front, so you can show off your shoes as well! This dress is perfect for a gala or black tie wedding. You can accessorize it with any king of jewelry, but I would recommend colorful earrings to dress it up and make it more fun! With this dress, the options are unlimited!","April 11, 2017","True to Size"

When I went to order this dress as my back up to another, they only had it left in the size I ordered so I didn't have high hopes. Well I was wrong! I think one size down would have fit better in the top, however this one was hugging my curves while still allowing some room in the stomach and bottom which allowed for eating and dancing. It's a heavy material which made it feel nicer and kept me warm in January. I ordered the long which was perfect for my 5'7"" and 3-4"" heels. I received a lot of compliments on this dress!

I give it 4* overall though because it wasn't as comfy as it could have been. The fabric doesn't have any stretch so it can get a bit uncomfortable in weird positions. Also, sleeves don't really fold well into a cardigan so, when I got cold, I just ended up with very frumpy/bulky arms.

I wore it with opaque tights for dinner and drinks -- dancing would have been a problem. What I LOVED was the quality of the fabric (seemed like 100% silk, didn't see the supposed polyester lining) and the details in the cut. There is a slightly wing-like layer on the sleeves, and the opening for the shoulders is pretty generous, and these features together made it surprisigly elegant in a very non-stuffy way. Re: sizing -- I would have sized up to S for length, but the style got a lot more voluminous without the skirt length improving much, so I went with the XS for the better overall fit.","February 11, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA27","Beth","Beautiful Gown. Great Fit","I wasn't as excited about this dress as I wanted to be at the beginning of the night, but it grew on me as the hours went by. Built in bra has clasps in the back, which I didn't understand from other reviews. It was a bit hard to hook, but I've had experience getting a wetsuit on, so I employed similar tactics and got it done. The bra was a little uncomfortable, at first, but became more comfortable as the night went on. I am very small chested and added some ""cutlets"" to fill things out. Unfortunately, I didn't secure them with fashion tape and they migrated to the center several times. I'm sure no-one else noticed them through the lace of the bodice, but I did. Had to go to the ladies room and readjust several times. Not the fault of the dress, though. I am just under 5'7"" and ended up wearing the 0L with 3"" heels and the length was great. I loved the train. The dress was perfect for a formal military function and I got plenty of compliments. I would definitely rent this dress again.","January 11, 2020","True to Size"

This dress garnered tons of compliments all night long and is both unique and elegant. My favorite part was the slight mermaid silhouette and the plunging back. Added bonus was that I didn't need a bra with the awesome built in bustier! An excellent option for a black-tie event. You won't regret it!","May 7, 2019","Formal Affair"

I'm 5'6 and had to wear kitten heels with size 2R, and the dress was just the right length. If you're above 5'5 and want to wear taller heels definitely go with a long. 2L wasn't available on my dates, but 2R worked out. I'm usually a size 2, occasionally 0, but definitely not in this dress! 2 fit like a glove with no additional breathing room, and the 4 would have probably been great.

I typically wear a size 10, sometimes a 12 if a dress was too tight in the bust. The 12 in this dress was SO tight in the cap sleeve (which also weirdly cut in too far at the armpit). RTR was out of a 14 so they sent me a 16 to try. It worked, but was baggy in the front and STILL the sleeve cut in too far. It was also close to being too short (I'm 5'7"" and wore 2.5 inch heels).

Both this dress and my backup were great and the hardest part of this whole process was choosing between two wonderful options. I ended up choosing this gown because it has a built in corset-like support so no special bra or shape wear was required. The dress was comfortable and easy to move in but still felt sophisticated and special. At 5'3"" wearing 3 1/4"" heels the hem brushed the floor but didn't trip me. A very small train behind got stepped on a few times but otherwise was no issue. I wore the size 2 at 117lbs, which was snug and form-fitting but comfortable. I received many compliments and even struck up a conversation with another lady at the event that was also very pleased with her rent the runway dress and also looked amazing!

It made me look like I hadn't popped out 3 kids in the past 4 years, and like I still have my act together (good one dress, we fooled them all!). All that said, I definitely had to be sausaged into it and I couldn't move at all whole I was wearing it. Opted to change into a different dresses for the reception. T-Rex arms and an inability to open my legs more than 1 foot in any direction were the biggest challenges. So you have to decide if it's worth it for you.","May 30, 2019","Small"

I went on the cinq à sept website to see the size chart and measured as a 4, I ordered a 6 based on people's comments about it being too small and I really needed an 8. I've never been more uncomfortable in a dress, I couldn't move and had to be zipped in and out of it as the arms are restrictive. If you are pear or hourglass shaped I would recommend ordering 1 size up from the size chart and order 2 sizes up as a back up. On the plus side the fabric does have some stretch, so I was still able to wear the 6 without ripping it, just wasn't able to move easily.","May 6, 2019","Wedding"

Cons: I would not recommend this dress for a wedding or an event that may include dancing because the dress is very restrictive in movement.

I used fashion tape to hem the dress about 6 inches. The material is thick so you feel secure in it but runs the risk of making you looked squished inside. I'm a 32D, without a bra, my boobs were squished flat and up to my chin, with a bra the dress felt even tighter. I chose to wear the bra since long flat boob was not my favorite look. The sleeves were very tight. All the comments about not being able to use your arms, SO TRUE. My fiance called me T-Rex all night. It was conservative and sexy. The top was tight and the lower section was very loose so not ideal. However, it was last minute and I couldn't be happier with the choice.

This dress had great potential but you need to size up 1-2 sizes and if you've got a large bum, definitely 2 sizes up! The sleeves are tight so if you like to dance at a wedding this is NOT the dress for you. I felt extremely sexy but I was so uncomfortable that I changed before the reception. Why? Cause I couldn't lift the dress up to go the bathroom, the dress was cutting off circulation to my arms, and I was constantly adjusting the top where the non slip grips were on the dress. I'm sure if you sizes right it could be great but don't plan on lifting your arms up without needing to readjust everything.","October 1, 2018","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS65","Jyoti","Sexy dress but good luck moving your arms around","I rented this dress to wear to an evening wedding that was cocktail attire. I got two sizes - a 0 and 2. I'm normally a 0 but this 0 was SO TIGHT. Definitely order a size up. Even the 2 felt a bit snug. Pros: very sexy and body hugging. I got tons of compliments all night Cons: I could not get this dress on by myself. Thank god my sister was there to help me! I could not move my arms to dance at the reception so I was somewhat robot like. Going to the bathroom was also a challenge, it was hard to lift up and pull back down. Tough call on whether I'd rent this again - it was a lot of ""maintenance"" to wear.","June 7, 2018","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS65","Shawna","Sophisticated and sexy","I fell in love with this dress because it was sexy without screaming for attention. It is a very classy dress. I read every review before I made my purchase....it does run small! I typically am a size 0 (5'5"" - 114 lbs). Most RTR size 0 dresses are loose on me so I ordered the 0 and the 2. I wore the 2 but the 4 would have been better. This dress is super tight. Every time I dropped something my husband had to grab it for me. I had difficulty trying to grab my phone off of the table while standing! Arms are restricted and boobs will be squished and I barely have any. I recommend sizing up and then getting your back up two sizes bigger just in case. (Ie: if you're a 6, order an 8 AND 10) especially if you have wide hips or a larger backside. Gorgeous dress. You can't go wrong. The navy does feel nearly black if your skin is on the browner side. Great thing: the dress comes in teal too!","June 5, 2018","Wedding"

I wasn't even going to try it on at first because it wasn't one of the dresses I had chosen but I thought why not and I immediately fell in love. It is amazing! The fabric is unique, has great stretch, I was able to wear the small and still had plenty of room when I'm usually a M/L. The colors are vibrant and the ruffle sleeves are romantic and fun. If you are an hourglass shape like me it definitely shows off the curves in the best way possible. I can't believe I got this dress completely by accident and it ended up stealing the show. Probably ranks up here as one of my favorite dresses of all time!","July 15, 2019","Formal Affair"

I got a lot of compliments about this dress, it was a hit at my cousin's wedding. I was not expecting the scuba material, but I liked that it was a bit stretchy and form-fitting without being inappropriate for a family event. There was a bit of pilling on the dress, and the material that goes from the front and makes the sleeves was not hemmed so there was some slight fraying along the bottom edge. This was not super noticeable unless looked at very up close. The sleeves were a bit looser and longer than I was anticipating, but they still looked cute and were not restrictive to my movements at all. I was able to dance and have a good time no problem all night. Overall I liked this dress and how it fit, but I wouldn't purchase it at the full retail price.","December 10, 2018","Large"

The dress is absolutely gorgeous and extremely comfortable. I rented the medium with a backup large based on other reviews that the dress runs large. I wore the medium. I'm not large chested and the top of the dress was definitely large on me, though with the ruffles and pattern it doesn't appear that way. The bottom half of the dress is very form fitting but the pattern is very forgiving and I felt totally comfortable (though I had on the spanx to help). One thing, I did feel like I was shimmying the dress down all day...perhaps it's the snug fit on the lower half of the dress? It was a small inconvenience though because I truly just loved this dress! Also, if you're going to be outside for long periods of time on a hot day and if you're like me who absolutely MELTS in humidity, I wouldn't recommend this dress because the scuba fabric and length traps that heat!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RZ22","Corinn","Loved This Dress!","I would absolutely recommend this dress! I wore it to a November wedding in NOLA. The dress was extremely comfortable and easy to wear. I wore the 4 (5'3"", 128lbs, 34D) and possibly could have worn the 2 (so I would say it runs true to size to a little bit big). When the dress arrived the lace at the neck and shoulders wasn't standing up as I had hoped, but nothing a little bit of ironing couldn't fix! The color was great, the lace detail is ideal for hiding a less than flat tummy, I received many compliments and felt great all evening!","December 19, 2018","True to Size"

The fit was just what I expected, the only warning I might offer is that the shoulder straps are wide set so if you have narrow shoulders they might slip down a lot. The halter tie does its job keeping the top up though so it isn't too big of a problem. I paired this with the Piamita black ruffle piping pant as suggested by a RTR stylist and the two pieces really made each other Pop! Lots of compliments all around!","May 10, 2017","Everyday"

It is a billowing top, which does not flatter all body types, but there's not too much material that it can be tucked into a high waisted skirt or pants to accentuate the waistline if one is needed (like I need). The only issue with the top is the straps. I am 5'9 and have broad shoulders, and they fell down over and over, with very little prompting. For this reason I have to reduce the stars, and let smaller ladies know what they are in for if they rent this piece. I got to the point of pulling them off to the side and wearing it as if the straps were meant to be across my arms for the rest of the day.","July 22, 2018","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH208","RTR Customer","Great dress!","This was my first RTR order and I haven't worn a formal dress in over a year so I was really nervous about sizing. I ordered the 8R and 6R and both fit but I ended up going with the 6R as it was shorter and fit more snug. Overall, it was a comfortable dress! I wished I could adjust the straps on the slip on the inside as they were too long and I would've felt more secure if they could have been higher. The cap sleeves do emphasize your upper arm area, which can be unflattering, and it does still show a stomach pooch even with Spanx on. I wore sticky boobs as to not show the straps or the side of the bra. My heels were about 2-3 inches.","November 26, 2018","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH208","RTR Customer","It was a great dress - comfortable, feminine and red.","I wore this dress for a formal affair of 200 people and it met all my requirements. I wanted a red dress, it had to be comfortable with somewhat of a flowing skirt that allowed for a lot of dancing, and I liked that the lace went to the shoulders with a small cap sleeve. I'm somewhat modest and didn't want to worry about anything 'falling out' if I bent over, or too skin tight given I was the guest of honor at an awards ceremony. It fit loose enough to be very comfortable. One caveat - the dress is surprisingly plain in person. A large bling necklace was perfect. Also, it is tailored for a far larger bust line than I have. I am a modest B cup, and I didn't even realize until I saw the pictures that it folded in rather than fit tight across the bust, even with a strapless pushup bra. Overall it was very comfortable, I felt confident in it, it fit great, and was elegant but not over the top. I wore the 10L. I am 5'8"" so needed 3"" heels.","October 30, 2018","Large"

The leg slit was so high it was not appropriate for a family gathering that I had intended it for. It was a little low in my chest so you could see my bra at times.

I kept hearing how the ribcage was small in it so I got a medium ad a large just in case. My ribcage is larger being an opera singer, but the medium for me fit just wonderfully. *I would say it’s definitely an evening dress.

It was beautiful!! The color is perfect & the sleeves & calf-length definitely made it a great dress for the occasion. Most reviews say to size up because the middle is tight. I agree - I usually order a 4 & 6 or S & M, but the S wasn't available so I got a M & XS. I wore the M, definitely couldn't have fit in the XS, but I think a S would've been better. It's pretty revealing - I didn't have a sticky bra & a regular bra would've shown too much, so I used tape to hold everything down. Loved this dress, but it was one of the trickier & less comfortable dresses I've rented.","June 12, 2019","Wedding"

The slit in the skirt adds one extra dimension of sexiness. The long sleeves were, frankly, a welcome bit of coverage. Overall- the zipper was a challenge, but only at the seams.

The waist section was very small so if I did anything other than stand I wasn't comfortable. I couldn't imagine sitting for hours and eating comfortably. The length, on the other hand, was too long for my height. Between the length and the a-line cut, the whole dress look awkward and overwhelming.

Great for winter nights - it was cold otherwise would have skipped tights. Cons - no pockets (automatic 4 stars), exceptionally tight waist with no give. I just don't understand why designers don't build in a bit more elastic at the waist. Our body shape standing is not the same as sitting. I thought about going up a size but he rest of the dress fit great. This photo definitely doesn't do it justice. Notes: you can go braless, but be prepared to bring some fashion tape. It zips up the side, which you can hide if you'd like to unzip while you eat. Highly recommend if you have a tiny waist","December 16, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/YK77","Jasmine","Lovely dress for a holiday party!","I wore this dress to my fiancé's company Christmas party in Savannah. I knew I wanted something that fit the vintage vibe of the city as well as the vibe of the historic venue/restaurant we were in. This absolutely fit the bill. I felt beautiful in this dress and received a ton of compliments. Since this is the first review of this dress I'm sharing extra details of the fit and structure for anyone who may be on the fence about renting this little number. For reference, I am 5'7, 145lbs, 30D bra size, and generally a size 4-6 in dresses. I ordered an XS and S, and ended up wearing the S. -The slit comes up WAY higher than I expected--almost to the base of my hip! This might be fine for other events like a wedding, but for a work function I knew I needed to either pin the slit a few inches or wear tights. I chose the tights. -The neckline is definitely a plunging neckline so a plunging bra is almost a necessity. You could probably wear it braless, but I wasn't quite comfortable with that since I was attending a company party. I actually safety-pinned the bottom of the neckline to the base of my most ""plunging"" bra and that worked okay, but I had to be very strategic about the way I pinned it so you couldn't see my bra. -There is no stretch to this dress, which made it a little tough to put on/take off. The side zipper was pretty low-quality too for an otherwise high-quality dress. I was nervous it would get stuck or break off every time I zipped up the dress. It ended up being fine, but something to keep in mind. -I thought this dress was very flattering for my pear-shaped figure, but I will note that it was pretty snug around my ribcage. If your bra band size is larger than a 30 or 32 and you're considering getting a small, get the medium. Overall, I was happy that I chose this dress and thought it was worth wearing despite the small complications with the tights/bra I listed above.","December 9, 2018","Party"

As expected, the small fit perfectly, however, another renter must have tried to hem it themselves at home which screwed up the whole look of the leg!!! I noticed that it looked weird on the hanger immediately which made me wonder why RTR doesn't pay attention to these obvious details as well. They don't check and then rent it out for $$$. Which in my opinion is very disappointing. It is a gorgeous jumpsuit. I was able to fit into the XS as well however, the zipper was broken and impossible to get it up and then down again.

Loved this outfit and will absolutely rent again.","January 12, 2017","Small"

I had to size up to the medium, but it was boxy and my shape was completely lost. The Capri length and wide leg pant are mostly to blame, but it made me look bigger than I am. Might look nice on someone with more of an hourglass shape, but I can't imagine this is a flattering fit for anyone bigger than a 2.","December 23, 2016","Party"

Perfect for anyone under 5'6"" and pear shaped. Cons: Way too small for tall girls. I'm 5'9"" and this rode up my rear end and was so uncomfortable I took it off immediately. I have a 34ddd bust and would never have zipped up this suit. My stats: 5'9"", 165lbs, (38-31-39) ,size 10, 34ddd","December 23, 2016","Party"

The fabric is very sturdy, to the point where I didn't need to wear any kind of bra or support with it. The fabric is also very wrinkle-resistant. I wore the dress for a work event, and it was a bit too low-cut, so I used removable fashion tape to attach a small piece of black fabric under the mesh to provide a bit more coverage. I am 5'2"" and wore 4"" heels and the regular was about 3.5"" too long (had to use more fashion tape to do a temporary hem). Oh, and IT HAS POCKETS that were big enough to fit my phone.","December 19, 2019","True to Size"

The fabric is really rich, beautiful, and detailed, but the dress still flows very well, is comfortable, and it isn't too heavy. In terms of sizing, I'm normally a solid 4, but the 2 fit very well and felt slimming. Even though the bust is low cut, the fabric across the bust makes the dress appropriate for a wedding or more formal event. The fabric across the bust was just dark/dense enough that it provided some coverage, but still allowed me to feel as though I was showing the right amount of cleavage. No bra was needed as the dress provides a great amount of coverage. Can't say enough good things about the dress - it was perfect for my event and a great dress overall!

It was comfortable and has pockets, which is always a plus. It is long, so I pretty much had to wear heels, I'm 5'5"", and the mesh neckline does come up to the top of your collar bone. I loved the texture of the dress, the picture shows the pattern so you can kind of see how it feels. If you are thinking about this dress, be sure you are comfortable with a lit of boobsge at your event. I did use some fashion tape just to be sure there were no slips, but the top was pretty tight so I want all that worried. Definitely an amazing dress.","December 6, 2018","True to Size"

I also suggest getting the Long if you are 5'7 or taller. I'm so glad I got the Long and it was the perfect length with a heel. The top is gorgeous but may be a bit tricky if you have a large chest. I'm small chested and wore sticky bra and some tape but I could have done nothing and it would have fit fine!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA128","Janielle","Class + Sass","I'm 5'5 165 and 36C. I'm usually somewhere between an 8 and 10. This dress fit me perfectly in the bust and waist. I wore a 8R and it was tight enough that I didn't have to wear a bra and worry about them ""dislodging"". I wore a plunge bra anyways and it was really more of a pain than anything. The fabric is so thick that I didn't have to worry about getting too cold..... for various reasons. Length was almost too short. I wore 3"" heels and it was perfect. Any taller and this would have been a no go. Pro: fitted in waist and bust, thick fabric, meshing is so classy. Con: the liner was ripped at the bottom. (I'm sure it's something they will fix) If you are too busty this dress may reveal more cleavage than your comfortable with, length was barely there with 3"" heels. Regardless, I wore this dress to a gala and then out dancing. I had enough room that I felt like I could easily dance and not worry about ripping.","November 13, 2018","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA128","RTR Customer","Loved this dress","I'm usually a 2 in dresses, but designer dresses tend to run smaller than department store dresses, so I chose a 4R as my main size and 2R as backup. I ended up wearing the 2R. The 4R was way too big in the chest/mesh area and gaped badly. I'm only 5'3, but I did not need to add hem tape with 3 inch heels. Several people complimented my dress, it was very comfortable, and has pockets! It was a very beautiful dress. To avoid a wardrobe malfunction in the mesh area, I ordered and wore a backless, strapless U plunge bra from amazon, and it worked perfectly with this dress. I thought I'd be the only one in this color at a fall black tie event--turns out there were almost as many women in burgundy dresses as black. It's a popular color.","November 7, 2018","True to Size"

After some crafty approaches, I was able to wear the dress with no bra and I felt very comfortable all night. Overall fit is true to size, with the extra length I was able to wear heels. The top is tight (I'm a 36F) which helps to keep everything in place. Fabric is thick so it's perfect for a fall/winter event, although it got a little bit after some crazy dancing.

I was worried that the fabric would be thick and look cheap (since it's polyester) but it was thin and looked very elegant and moved easily.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LMC15","Sunny","Dinner Gala","This was my backup dress option (there was a coupon to get one for free), so I only had the one size to try. Based on the main dresses that I thought I would end up wearing, both a size 0 and 2 probably would have worked. I had the size 2 and it fit great. There wasn’t too much extra room in the bust, a problem I usually have. Great length, though if you’re short like me (5’2”) be prepared to wear at least 3” heels. I switched to flats when we went out after our event and stepped on the hem unless I held the dress up while walking. Gorgeous fabric, very comfortable. The downside (like, did a man design this dress??) is that the dress hanging straps are attached to a spot that makes it really difficult to tuck them in and away. If this were my own dress I’d have cut them off. Instead I used some hemming tape to tape them to the inside of the dress, but as I moved around throughout the evening, my husband had to keep tucking them back in. Might be a dealbreaker for you depending on the event, so I wanted to make sure you knew!","January 28, 2019","True to Size"

Got compliments for my dress from other guests :) I don't look like i have a huge belly from this dress. haha! It looks like a plain dress but the detail at the bottom makes it interesting. It's lined but the material is not thick - it's perfect for California summer days! The only complain I have is the string/thread that connects the two layers at the bottom - somehow results in a weird outline/flow-y shape (somehow doesn't flow with the rest of the bottom of the dress). but if you take pictures from certain angle, u can hide it.. and it's not noticeable to others as long as u walk confidently :) I will rent this dress or other similar design from this designer again in the future!","July 19, 2018","Wedding"

I'm usually a size 6 in dresses, but the top is snug so I wore the size 8 the night of event. Pockets are another plus of this dress. My only complaint is the dress had clearly been worn several times before it made its way to me - the ribs of the corset poked out of the top.

I did not need to wear a bra because the top is very supportive.

I went with the 8R and a 10R as a backup, and it fit true to size except maybe slightly big for me in the bust area (and I'm pretty large chested) but the length and fit was otherwise perfect. It looks white online but is definitely silver, so I paired it with silver strappy sandals, silver jewelry, and a silver clutch. The fabric seemed prone to wrinkles so you might need to press, otherwise a great choice that works well for all seasons.","July 3, 2018","True to Size"

Zipper was a bit tricky, just the nature of a worn dress and not so great zippers. The fit was super flowy past the chest, so not necessarily the most flattering dress possible but I liked the fit and got tons of compliments. The flowiness was lots of fun for dancing, and I loved the pockets. Pretty comfortable and easy to wear all night. The length was perfect for me at 5'3"", with back being just above floor length bare foot. It might've looked a bit more dramatic if I was taller, but I liked it the way it was.

The chest also has zero stretch and I would say really only comfortably fits up to a C cup. The con to this dress though is the stomach area--it make me look like I was pregnant, even when I stood up straight with perfect posture.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH165","Diana","Perfect PostPartum Dress","Hi I was 2 months post baby and wore this to an outdoors wedding last week of September in NY. I am 5'1 and wore it with a 2 inch heel and it fit fine. The bottom back of dress gently grazed the floor. I got many compliments all night I about how amazing I looked and how you couldn't tell I just had a baby. The picture included here is not from the event but from trying it on at home days prior. Day of event I wore it with a white fascinator, white strappy heels, and a ""fur"" cover. Please note the bands on the top are silver and blue not white and blue. As I wore white gold jewelry and the white shoes and white fascinator my entire outfit flowed; however, silver shoes would be most appropriate. I highly recommend for post partum mommas! I did not wear bra but still could wear nursing pads. I did not even really need to wear spanx since dress was not tight in tummy. Bodice is fitted and then skirt portion balloons out a bit which is very flattering. The only thing is by end of the night I noticed that I felt one of the wires from the bodice poking me in the belly. Fortunately, was not low on abdomen. In any case, when I sat up straight it did not poke me nor was it painful, just something I noticed. (Usually I would have been dancing, but sat most of the night this particular evening). Before baby I would have worn 6. Now I ordered 8-10 and wore the 8.","October 2, 2017","Wedding"

I am 5'4"" and I often worry about dresses being too long, but the back just skimmed the floor with 2-inch heels, and since the front is shorter it was perfect. The color is beautiful in person, and the flow ruffle nature of the skirt makes it really fun to dance in! However, I will say, if you have a very modest wedding it may be a bit too much-- as some other reviews say, since it is a wrap dress the front of the skirt tends to totally fall open when you sit down and you have to be careful of that or just prepare to wear some bicycle shorts under your dress! The front bust also felt slightly big, even with the adjustable straps, so I ended up pinning it. But I was very happy and got lots of compliments!","September 9, 2019","True to Size"

The wrap was adjustable and didn't feel awkward around my belly at all. The dress was super comfortable and flattering. However, it is very low cut, so I used a safety pin to pin the top together, but that was a personal choice.

The material is nice, the color is great, and the style is gorgeous. It looks in the photo like it's shorter in the front, but it's not - I think it's just how the model is standing. I'm usually around a size 6, and the small wouldn't even zip up. I tried the medium and it BARELY zipped, but the bust was HUGE. It was really poufy and not flattering. I returned it immediately for a credit because I had to get something else to wear to the fundraiser I needed it for. I'm not sure who would look good in this (maybe someone busty with a very tiny waist?), but it really is a pretty dress.","May 22, 2018","Small"

It is fitted at the hips so I would likely size up the next size for backup so that I can have some room to tuck in a blouse!

I'm typically a 2/4, so I sized up to the 4 (36) after reading up on Carven and other reviews. I couldn't even zip it, and it was way too snug around my bubble butt. So disappointing, because it's a really cute skirt and I'd planned on wearing it to a party with tall black boots. My measurements are 34-26-38, and I'm 5'9. I guess keep this in mind for your reference when choosing a size! I think I would've needed the 6 or maybe even 8 in this.","December 12, 2018","Party"

Pre-pregnancy I was a 32DDD. I have no idea what I am now, but larger than that. I'm usually a size 4, and ordered this dress when I was much smaller in a 4 and a 6.

I'm glad I did. The bodice keeps things contained and the shoulder material does not fall or ride up. It is a well made dress.

This paired with a fun necklace (also from RTR) was the perfect solution. I was very pleased with the fit, I usually wear an 8 and I wore the corresponding size 44 and I don't think I would have wanted it go bigger. I would have probably felt more comfortable with some Spanx but I didn't have any at the time.","December 15, 2015","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP5","Jennifer","Fabulous, flattering, floaty & fitted","Simply beautiful dress - the top is a beautiful portrait cut that you can wear on or off shoulders. If you have great shoulders & back, flaunt them in this beauty with joy. The top is super-fitted and the skirt is cut & architecturally constructed to flair out in sections. It's so simple yet has such an interesting shape that you're sure to draw attention in this elegant black (or is it a blue-black?) dress. The material is thick-ish, somewhat stretchy and will squeeze in your middle sans Spanks(c)! Definitely STEP into it - limited stretch but it's the only way you'll get into it. I usually wear XS or 0 and this 38 (translates to a 2) is very fitted - if I gained 2 #, I couldn't wear it comfortably! The arms holes are a tiny bit more snug than I'd like so I'd say size up if in doubt BUT you definitely want the fit & flare to do its magic. If you want to go for simple with couture impact - go with this gorgeous dress!","May 5, 2015","Small"

It's super stretchy and definitely runs a bit smaller in the bust/arm area, so size up for your backup size. I love the material and the ability to just slip it on (there are no zippers). It's also thick enough to wear without a bra, but has enough coverage that any standard bra hides under it. I'd recommend this for a more conservative event.

Fit perfectly, though I didn't like the way my arms looked in the photos. But that's my problem, not the dress. The material is heavy. Great dress, I'd rent again if the need for a LBD arises again.

The nude lining was slightly longer on the back than the overlay but good tape held it in place. The zipper is near impossible to zip past the ribbon. My husband said it was the toughest one he's zipped for me to date. I received several compliments all evening.

I loved the look and quality of the dress. The only negative was that the lace seemed to have shrunk up slightly above the lining, which I assume happened from prior dry cleanings, so I had to tug at the lace when I stood up to pull it down and into shape.

The 18L fit like a glove and I fell beyond beautiful at the ball. I received lots of compliments on the gown and I added a sparkly belt to make it really stand out. Pros: I'm 5'9 so the length just brushed the floor barefoot. Perfect fit. Stunning color. Comfortable all night long. Cons: the dress came with a dark red stain on the left side of the gown, right at him level. The zipper was insanely hard to get up at a spot around the bust due to the fabric in the back of the gown. Once you got past that spot it was smooth sailing. The top of the dress pull down due to the weight of the gown and so the heart shaped bust rolled, revealing the inside stitching of the gown. I was constantly fixing it. Overall: I would still rent this gown despite the cons. I felt beautiful and that's something a mother of two doesn't often say.","November 9, 2018","Formal Affair"

I also wasn't finding much else that I liked for this event. It is a beautiful flowy dress and I received many compliments. I wore a sweater to cover the fact that I couldn't make any of my bras work with the halter style and to cover up my psoriasis issues on my elbows.

It was lightweight which was perfect since I wore it to my sister's graduation and I had to sit outside in the heat for a few hours. It was a bit tight in the neck area for me though. It is also very shapeless, even with the provided belt. I wore an 8 (normally wear a 10) and I think a 6 would have fit me better since the 8 made me look kind of big. Overall I would have liked the dress better if it were a few inches shorter so it wouldn't look as bulky. Regardless, it is a good dress if you have a big chest like me, or if you're pregnant.","July 16, 2018","Large"

I'm 5'6"", a B cup, and normally wear a size 4 so I ordered a Small and the Medium as my back up. I tried the small on first and it was tight but not suffocating so I tried the medium and it looked like a potato sack; I wore the small and was comfortable all night. The back of the dress is very open so I opted out of wearing a bra; no one could tell the difference. If you're a size C cup or larger, keep in mind that a larger size may be more comfortable; my chest was pretty squished.","June 20, 2017","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK66","Alanna","Future Forecast: One of my favorite rentals","I was going to a concert and wanted to just look super chic with a little edge and this dress fit that to a T. I wore the large because the medium was a little too short for my 5'9 frame but the large fit perfectly. It's runs a little small length wise but just size up and there won't be a huge difference of fit on your waist, chest or hips. I wore spank because I wanted to keep it tight but you really don't have too in this dress. I received a lot of compliments on the dress and am going to be really sad when I give it back but it just enhanced a really fun evening. Great rental, would recommend checking it out!","June 11, 2017","Other"

I am 5'1""/115 lbs and the small was perfect, the length hit me about mid-thigh. The open back means going braless but the lining was soft and comfortable.

The design is beautiful and the hint of shimmer in the black makes it really pop. While most were wearing plain black, the blue in the dress really gives it that color to make it all the more attractive. The open back is a great touch and really flattering. The dress is tight, but in all the right ways to make it sexy, I wasn't uncomfortable once all night. The length hit me at about mid thigh so I didn't find it to be too short.

The neckline and back combination makes it more interesting than your typical party dress. It's got enough subtle sparkle to catch people's eyes from across the room. The only issues I had were: the hem kept riding up and the mid-back clasp dug into my skin. But these were minor compared to how great the rest of it was. I rented this with another dress for my birthday weekend and there was a problem with my discount code- it wouldn't go through on the app. I wasn't thrilled with the customer service (they told me what I already knew and didn't address the error message I was getting, despite me attaching three screenshots of the combined information). Eventually I figured it out myself by putting the code in on the computer (it wouldn't work on the app or on mobile), but too much time had gone by to get what I wanted in time and I ended up paying more than what I saved with the discount in shipping. They said I should have called.","October 7, 2016","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR19","Caitlin","I feel pretty, and comfortable, and I have pockets!","I rented a 10 (and an 8 as a totally unrealistic backup) because there was no 12 available. I wasn't optimistic because my wide shoulders, healthy guns and generous back yard don't add up to a size 10. This dress didn't care about my shoulders, biceps, hips or thighs - just rib cage and bust. I'm 33"" around the bra-band region and the size 10 fit well. The size 8 fit and zipped also, but smashed my boobs a bit. I bought and wore a torturous sticky bra thing because on me anyway, a regular bra would have shown in both the front and the back. Even though the fabric was thick enough that none of my bits would show through, I'm over 50, and a little lift and shape was in order. I went to a fancy gala with my sophisticated sister. I'm not at all comfortable with ""fancy"" or ""gala"" and just the idea of celebrities, wealthy and powerful people, and the outrageously good-looking made me feel like I was going to vomit. This lovely dress made me fit in just fine, and I was comfortable enough to talk to some very smart, interesting (and yes, outrageously good-looking) people. And pockets! In one pocket: my own cell phone, lip balm, hotel key, pair of socks, cash, credit card and charging cable. In the other: my sister's cell phone, lip gloss, and a pair of courtside tickets to a Warriors game won in the charity auction. Apparently, you can't actually fit anything in a Judith Lieber clutch, even if you could remember where you put it.","November 23, 2018","Party"

This dress is a show stopper - women of ALL ages were telling me how much they loved my dress. It is very comfortable and fun to dance in and the POCKETS are amazing! I thought it was a great length, I am 5'2'' and wore this with 4 inch heels. Runs true to size, I opted for the size 0.","March 27, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ111","Delaney","Gorgeous and eye-catching dress, but definitely size up","This was a replacement when my first two sizes in another dress didn't fit, but I'm so glad I got this one! I'm a comfortable 8 that leans towards a 6, but I'm glad I got this in a 10! I was able to zip it myself, but it was pretty tight, but it was a sexy tight (no weird bulging/bunching). The R length was perfect with 2.5 in heels (I'm 5'4""). The halter/backless look is really lovely and the mermaid look is really sexy, and I didn't have much trouble walking around, though I was attending a gala and didn't have to move around too much. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for something attention-grabbing and form-fitting, but definitely make sure to size up.","March 9, 2020","Small"

I typically wear a size 6 in Elizabeth and James, but I followed the advice of other reviews and sized up to an 8L. I wore flats, but could have worn a small heel and it would have still been long enough. The material is thick and forms to the body so I went bra-less and still felt supported.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ111","Iris","Incredibly supportive, glamorous, and elegant dress.","This is without a doubt my favorite rental from RTR. I’m usually a size 0 or 2, but I got a 2R and 4R for the event. This dress was dangerously tight, which I love. Because it is a thicker material, it didn’t feel as if it would rip when I squeezed myself into it with the help of my fiancé. I feel like a 4R is the equivalent of somewhere between a 0 and 2, and it would have fit more smoothly had I not wanted a sleeker feel. This is one of the few dresses that can deliver that without awkward bulges in certain places. I’m 5’6, and I wore the 2R with 2.5 inch heels. I didn’t want to wear higher heels, so I didn’t want to risk getting an L, but with a total height of around 5’8, the 2R was an inch ish too short. It still was, by far, one of my favorite dresses of all time. I was being complimented left and right, and the event photographer followed me for what seemed like half the night at a black tie event full of well dressed guests. Rent this dress. You won’t regret it, and you’ll look and feel like a queen.","September 10, 2019","Small"

The 8L fit perfect (5ft7 and wore 2 in heels). I tried on the 8R and it was too short to even wear with sandals. So comfortable and did not require a bra as it was very fitted. Highly recommend!","August 19, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ111","Emily","Very Classy!","I loved this dress for being so flattering and classy, but still sexy. It definitely ran small - I could have worn my normal size, but I wouldn’t have been able to go to the bathroom very easily (it was wayyy too tight across my thighs to pull it up to use the bathroom). I’m 5’2 and the normal length wasn’t bad with 4 inch heels. The material was SUPER thick, which is normally appreciated, however on a 100 degree day, it was really hot! My only other complaint - my friend was on the “back” duty all evening. When I sat down, the back slid down a little, it was like pulling up a strapless top. However, I also loved that I could wear a bra with this style.","July 23, 2019","Small"

I received so many compliments on it and was extremely happy. Only suggestion- I am 5’7 and ordered the long size according to the size chart. I think I would have liked the dress even more if I had ordered the normal length because it was a little long on me, even with heels. Other than that.. I LOVED it!!","June 15, 2019","True to Size"

I usually am a size 6 and there was no way I could get it zipped so I wore my backup size 8R. I did not need a bra, it is a form fitting dress and it was amazingly comfortable. Since the wedding was in grass, I wore flat sandals and the 8R was perfect, had I worn my typical fav 3 or 4 in heel, I would have preferred the 8L. I am 5'6"" and 135lbs. It was sexy and sophisticated and perfect for the occasion. I danced in it all night and it was comfortable, the fabric gives and there was no need to make adjustments on it at all. It is difficult navigating the steps because it is tight around the knees but just hike it up. Very flattering, got tons of compliments, just size up!","June 10, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ111","Christina","Too short and too small","I am always a 0R or 2R in women’s eveningwear, especially because most designers lean on the bigger and longer side (recognizing that many women get alterations and wear heels- but I digress) and here I would have been happy and comfortable with a 6L. Elizabeth & James is designed by Mary Kate and Ashley- so think of their body type when ordering. The dress in a size 4 was so tight I could not even wear shapewear, and was the perfect length to wear flats. I wore a small heel which lifted the gown from the floor, because this simply wasn’t an occasion I could wear flats to, so there wasn’t much I could do. I am disappointed that this dress was not the fit I wanted, but I did get many compliments about how classy and elegant the dress was.","February 6, 2019","Small"

I noticed a big difference in the two sizes (you can see from the pictures). The 2 was a little tight, but the length was perfect (I wore 4.5-inch heels)! The 4 was a little more comfortable, but it dragged and I was nervous I would trip. I ended up wearing the 2 and was very happy with it.

It's the kind of dress that really hugs your body, which I was a little worried about, but the fabric is thick enough so you don't see any bumps. I bought spanx to wear underneath anyway, but you don't need to. Although the regular length didn't hit the floor, I think if I ordered a different length it would've been too long.

I don't think the lace holds up well to all of the wears. Besides the snags, mine was loose in the back on one side. It was easily fixed with double sided tape, but a minor inconvenience.

Just a really pretty dress. Great for when you need to dress a tad conservatively, yet still want to stand out.","November 22, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL181","Adriane","I got a lot of compliments on this dress! It was an elegant and sexy choice.","The sleeves were a bit tight when I first put the dress on, but they did seem to loosen up as the night went on. Also, it's a good dress to wear in colder weather because it was very warm. I was worried about the neck being too tight, but it did not bother me at all. I feel that it was true to size, but I'd probably get one up as the extra size since the sleeves can run a bit small. It's a great dress for weddings or holiday parties. I definitely recommend this!","July 18, 2017","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL181","Kimberly","This was a show-stopper.

I was a bit disappointed that the lace had been torn at the forearm a bit but the ""show must go on"" and if anyone noticed, no one said anything. I got several compliments and the cut out on the back of this dress is eye-popping. Overall, loved how I felt and looked in this dress!","March 27, 2017","Small"

I normally wear a 2 or a 0 in mall brands so I ordered a 2 and a 0 here. I probably should have gone with a 2 and a 4. The 2 was a little tight but it fit perfectly with spanx. It was very comfortable and I could wear a regular bra. There were a few little stray threads and snags that needed to be trimmed prior to wearing but otherwise it was in great condition.

I don't know if I will get the dress again seeing that my boobs were the main focus of the night... But it was a fun dress to wear! (I'm a 34G - I hope that helps!)","December 19, 2014","Party"

My girlfriends loved it, but my husband thought it looked like a funeral dress so I didn't wear it. The material was thick and warm, and the dress was comfortable. The other reviewers are correct though- unless your a yoga pro, you will need someone to help you zip up the top part. The zipper on the bottom part of the dress I got wouldn't go all the way down, but I was able to get it on over my head.

(Plus- open back, but no special bra needed!)","This dress was great for a black tie winter wedding. I wanted to look sophisticated- most long sleeves are borderline matronly, Not this dress! It is form fitted, but comfy. The cut outs on the sides are small enough that you don't have to be rail thin to wear, but big enough so the dress feels sexy. Same for the open back (which is amazing because you can still wear a regular supportive bra!) plus, the laser cut lace allowed for a fun floral vs the traditional lace. I typically do not wear a dress this fitted, but I might be a convert after this. (I'm not a thin girl, don't let the picks fool you- the dress and 4 inch heals made me look like I dropped 10lbs) Received so many compliments all night long : ) Specs- sleeves were perfect length, also not too skinny Size was true- maybe a teeny big, dress is stretchy Length was great for 5'3 and 4 inch heals (dress showed just enough of my shoe and I wasn't tripping on the dress)","January 22, 2017","Wedding"

VERY happy with my choice! I'm also glad that I went up a size, as the fabric is sturdy - not restrictive, but very well made, so not a lot of stretch. Because the top and bottom are attached tightly with the cutouts, I needed the extra ""length"" in the torso from the 8 to be able to move my shoulders comfortably. Also, because I went up a size, that made the sleeves a little more loose. I kind of liked that look. A little nod to the 80's. The cutout in the back was delicious, yet conservative. The slight mermaid at the bottom was very classy, and definitely formalized the dress a little more. Length was perfect, and RTR consultants had been recommending that I go with L sizes in other gowns (my heels were just 2 1/2 inches). If I could wear this gown every day, I'd actually consider it!","December 24, 2016","True to Size"

Had to tuck up the sleeves since they were too long but that was easy enough to do! Don't think I could have danced fully in this and just didn't seem flattering on me so I went with my backup instead (otherwise I would have worn the 4R).

Not sure if the sleeves are shorter or my arms are long for it, but the sleeves were more like 3/4 length, which was actually perfect to have a bracelet on that shows. The biggest cons of this dress are the top zipper. It's an awkward zipper that you have to almost go in on an angle to get it to zipper. I couldn't do it once it was on, so I had to start the zipper and then put it over my head, which was a bit of a challenge but doable. Other reviews mentioned that you could wear a regular bra with this, so I did that. Then once I had it on, it showed a bit at the bottom. I didn't want to deal with the zipper again, so I left it and sort of pulled the back of my bra up. Really I could have gone braless because the material is thick. I really liked this dress and would rent again.","December 19, 2019","True to Size"

What you don't see on the website is that detail of the fabric which is beautiful. However, I had to safety pin the neck closed because there was nothing for the clasps to hook into. Even at 5' 10"" tall with wedges I was still stepping on it a little so keep that in mind when you order the length.","July 22, 2018","True to Size"

The shoulder straps for hanging also weren't on the size 12, but I was ok with it as I think they can get in the way anyway. The dress is tight on a curvy gal but also pretty flattering. I rented fushia earrings as well and it was a great color pop. Those colors together are beautiful! The material is thick but not too thick for beach wedding and it does hide lumps and dimples.

This is not a dress I would have normally picked out, but a stylist sent this my way and I gave it a shot. Looking at the pictures, I felt like I would look chunky in it, but nope! This dress is shaped beautifully. The fabric has just enough stretch to be comfortable, but is thick enough to conceal all of the things that make me feel uncomfortable. I've had two children so my stomach isn't in the best shape - I'm very self-conscious of that area, and the dress smoothed it out well enough. However, I'm pretty flat-chested at a 34C. This dress would look much nicer on someone with a fuller bust as the shoulder was ever-so-slightly too loose on me. I ended up wearing my first choice dress, but would be happy to wear this one out.

I rented it with my Unlimited subscription in a size 4 and while I liked it a lot, it kept popping open in the chest and showing my bra. It was also a bit looser in the waist than I would have liked. I exchanged the 4 for the size 2 instead and OH MY GOD I am now totally obsessed. It doesn't pop open in the front anymore and it really accentuates my waist. It's a wrap dress so you can adjust the waist a bit with the tie straps and there are also 2 small buttons on the inside that allow you to loosen/tighten it. The 2 is a little shorter than the 4 but still the perfect mid-thigh length without being inappropriate (and I am 5'11 so I have issues with things being too short) It is really well made and perfect for warm weather. I am really debating buying this dress. Can't wait to wear it again!","October 6, 2017","Everyday"

A few caveats: the skirt flutters easily in the breeze, so you may need to hold it down when walking outside. It does cling to your legs, so a slip is a good idea. Finally, as others have pointed out, a cami of some kind is essential as the neckline falls quite low. The print is lovely and looks better in person than online, IMO.","July 5, 2017","Work"

Fit details: I'm 5'3"", 117, average/petite build. Normally 34B, slightly larger at the moment due to nursing. I've got two small children, and I no longer have a flat stomach, so I always look for a dress that is forgiving in the midsection. This dress managed to be flattering by having a substantial weight to the material, and a nice cut. Shows off the areas I'm more confident in (back and shoulders). It's definitely a little bigger in the busy area; I am pretty small-chested and the dress would have fit more securely if I was better endowed! But it worked. Has some support in the chest area (if you're big enough), so no bra is needed. Felt appropriate for a charity gala, but still a tad sexy! Just a tiny bit long with 3"" heels. This probably wouldn't work for a very tall person.","February 2, 2019","Formal Affair"

The fabric has zero give, and the zipper gets stuck at the waist seams, so even with room to spare it did take some help getting into it. I wore a strapless bra for my comfort, but probably didn't need to. I am broader through the ribcage, so my back-up size (one size up) was the one I went with. As a shorter woman, the side piece fell lower than I had thought, so I did wear some crazy high heels.

My normal size wouldn't zip past my rib cage. Its definitely short, but I got used to the draft after awhile and thought it elongated my legs nicely. The only negative is that the top was a little big and the pleats didn't lay right at times. I wore a strapless bra to fill it out a little better, but bustier ladies could totally go without a bra.

I wore it to church but caution- it is short in the back if you have a bigger bottom, as it will pull the dress up. The 44 fit just right around my rib cage and back (I typically upsize because as a weightlifter, my back is broad) but was a little big around my breasts. Since it was a one-shoulder dress, this wasn't an issue. The material is excellent and I used the asymmetrical piece almost like a blanket when I was sitting in the church to cover my legs. If you don't mind being conscientious about the back and pulling it down when necessary, it's a great, fun, and unique rental with vibrant colors, textures, and patterns.","May 29, 2018","True to Size"

I ended up still wearing the 8, but had to wear spanx underneath (I didn't before, but have gained some weight). The 6 was OK, but too tight for my stomach area (but did fit better for my boobs).

I usually ordered a size 0 or 2 in dresses. This dress I could have worn in a 6. The 2 was super tight around the waist, and the 4 was only a little bit looser, which made me think I could have gone up higher. I did not wear a bra with the dress, which was fine. The dress is gorgeous, I felt so confident in it all night, nice material, wore it to a summer wedding in a heat wave and was fine walking outside, it's breathable, but I could see this being a great winter dress, too. Unless you have the tiniest waist and never have to worry about fitting in the belly, my advice is order a size up as your small size, and then go one size even higher as the back up.","July 27, 2019","Small"

Although the size 2 fit perfectly, I ended up going with another dress as this one wasn't dressy enough for my event. I enjoyed the fact the fact that the hi-low style fit my short stature perfectly and can we talk about the pockets??? GENIUS! I loved that aspect of the dress! I felt that it made my hips look a little bigger than I would've liked but everyone who saw me try it on said it looked great and I was comfortable in it and that's what mattered.

Otherwise it's a great dress! Loved the purple color. You can easily wear a strapless bra. Be careful wearing bracelets with this dress - mine got caught a couple times on the lace.

Dress is good for many age groups and if you are in decent shape a senior can wear it without looking like she is trying to dress too young. I am 5'2"" and 112 pounds and felt I was a little curvy in waist and hips for the dress. Dress is appropriate for girls in their 20's if they do not want to wear something too revealing. The size 4 was more comfortable, however since I am petite (5'2"") it was too long in the torso causing the back zipper to buckle - I was able to pull the dress up by the shoulders about 1 inch. The size 2 fit fine in torso but was tight but wearable. Since I could not wear the size 4 and another dress I rented was way too small (they did not have my usual size 4), I had no other options except to wear the size 2 purple dress.","April 9, 2019","True to Size"

Right combo of professional, classy, haute couture, sexy","I am about 32"" at the bust and 39"" at the waist, so I often find something that fits up top and is just way too tight across the hips. This was absolutely perfect - I didn't even take the backup size 4 out - it might have worked but I felt great in the 6. The length is great, too, right around the knees. When I attend work events I prefer that it's not too short, especially where I'll be sitting at a dinner for a large portion of the night. Now, when you sit, the buttons on the side slit will separate and your skin will show. And when you're sitting, that's like up over where your underwear is. I think it's discrete enough that the man next to me didn't notice...and frankly I wasn't too worried about it. But just know that happens.

It's noticeable when you walk, because the dress has ruffles with contrasting stitching at the bottom. It's not a deal-breaker, but something to be aware of.","August 10, 2019","Vacation"

The slip that comes with this dress is a non-stretch silk material. I'm a 4 or 6 depending on the cut and this was a hard 6.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ML175","Haley","I wore this dress for work. It was super comfortable and very pretty!","I really enjoyed wearing this dress. Typically, you find a dress is either comfortable to wear or really beautiful. This dress was both. I love how stretchy and thick the material is...makes it very very forgiving. Stretchy materials are often thin which means every flaw is visible. Not so with this dress! I liked the little peak-a-boo of blue in the underside as well. This dress could easily be dressed up for an event or occasion. I did have some trouble with the way the dress flared and had to steam it in a certain way to get it to fall right, even then I still had to adjust it throughout the day or it stuck out way too far on the sides and looked almost like I was wearing a tutu underneath. It also creases easily and the lines stay visible even after you've tried to flatten them out. However, the dress is black so this is a minor problem in my opinion. Overall, I think this was a really good rental.","October 30, 2017","True to Size"

Sorry for the terrible photo, but I had no one to help me take the pic. As other reviews have said the fabric is heavy. However, it is still a single woven layer of fabric, so it's not forgiving either. It's fairly tight in the midsection and goes out right at my hips which I didn't like. The arm holes were also quite large on both the M and L and the pit fat wasn't flattering. I haven't worn a high/low before and really wanted to. However at this length, it felt like I had a cape on. Wasn't a fan. If I were to wear it I'd wear the L mostly to be a little less tight in the midsection.","September 12, 2017","Small"

Also wore with Spanx - necessary even at the larger size to have that smoothed profile! But I got SO many compliments and the sleeves made the feel covered even given the off shoulder neck line. It fell about 3""-4"" below my knees, but kinda gave off the midi-trend look, so I liked it. Would have given 5 stars except the dress was slightly flawed on the right sleeve as a prior user did not use the straps but the clips to hang which left a mark in the fabric.","September 18, 2018","True to Size"
