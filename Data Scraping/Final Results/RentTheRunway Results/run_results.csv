I did not get the belt, but I don't think it needed it. Very light material, but thick enough to be flattering. Pairs great with white pants!","April 24, 2020","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NNAT5","Nicoletta","Beautiful and Comfortable!!","This top is amazing!! I rented this to go to a Saturday afternoon ballet in FL. I normally wear a small or medium in tops. I got both small and medium in this top and the small fit amazing! I saw some reviews that complained about the top being too big and or not having a belt. I suggest sizing down since I tried the small on and it fit perfect. It was a little bit fitted while the sleeve was still billowing and beautiful. The material is lightweight and the color is striking.","February 18, 2020","Other"

Would have worn it more if I had more places to go. I have wide hips and a post baby bump that isn't going anywhere. It flows really nicely, hiding the areas I'm not as fond of, while flattering my best qualities. It's more of a royal blue and it worked with black pants. I liked it most with 3/4 length pants.","October 3, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NNAT5","Nikki","No belt, no problem","The top arrived without the belt, which seems to be a trend from the comments. No time to get a new one with it, so made it work. It looked cute loose also, though not super figure flattering that way. I tried white leggings, but the high side was too high up on my thigh to feel comfortable showing that much white legging leg (I'm tall), so paired with dark blue skinny jeans and flats for the theater. It's unique and eye catching and I felt cute wearing it ... though one arm was cold! ;) Rated a 3 vs 4 because of the belt thing.","June 28, 2019","Vacation"

I called RTR and they sent another shirt out, but it was also missing the belt. I still wore it and it was quite pretty. It does run large, so I suggest getting one size smaller than you think you need.","September 5, 2019","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NNAT5","RTR Customer","Such a pretty top","This is such a pretty top! Like other reviewers, mine came without the belt - but that can be remedied with a ribbon or worn without. Hollywood fashion tape helps it stay in place with such a big neckline. Love this top!

The first time, I sent it back, but dreamed of it, so I rented again. It came without the sash again. So without the sash, it can't be worn as shown in the picture.

I ended up wearing it on the side. I ordered a size too big so it slid a little on the sleeveless side. But color and shape were perfect.

As such, many garments are hit or miss for me with more tending to be misses. That said, this one is SO flattering and fun. I feel so good in it that I ended up purchasing it. At my height and a 1x the shirt fits me more like a sundress which is absolutely perfect. If I put a heel on, and a pant it would work, too, but I prefer it as a dress. : )","May 26, 2019","Large"

I am 38 weeks and about 142lbs. The dress worked well for the event and was easy to dress up. The side with the slit is a little odd since the rouched seam sits on the side of your belly. This almost makes it look like maybe the dress doesn't fit. Overall not a bad maternity dress comfortable with some simple features to make it more dressy.","April 30, 2019","Wedding"

I'm almost 18 weeks and don't really have a bump yet, but this accentuated the teeny tiny bump that I do have, which is nice! I didn't wear a bra because the dress was pretty tight and supportive on its own.

It is more of a casual style and material, so it can be dressed down easily for a day of low-key fun but you still feel the urge to dress up. Longer than I usually go, and my usual size actually felt a bit loose, but I didn't have a second size to compare it against, so I am rating it as ""true to size.""","November 9, 2018","True to Size"

I needed help from my husband with zipping up the dress, since the zipper was getting stuck in the waist area. I liked the ropey part the you can untie and adjust. The full skirt was fun! However, the dress has some extra fabric in the tummy area and I almost looked pregnant (which I was not). I ended up wearing this dress twice.","September 22, 2018","True to Size"

The ties are made of a hard, gauzy like material but can look nice with help from a friend. Because I'm so broad, I'm usually a 6 and sometimes even an 8 in dresses that zip all the way up the back. Because this dress had adjustable shoulders and a V-back, I ordered a 6 and a backup size 4. I wore the 4 and still had room to move. Size down for your back up FOR SURE! It was a float dress that was easy to move, sit, and help in. Highly recommend for a day time event!","August 26, 2018","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HTC38","Brittany","Cute spring/summer dress","I'm usually between a size 2 and 4 and wore the 2. It fit perfectly. Because of the cut, it's roomy in the stomach and is great at hiding that area. It also has adjustable ties at the shoulders so also makes it easy to adjust for a larger or smaller bust. Not too low for the chest. Super cute and conservative enough for work. My boyfriend loved it and I got a bunch of compliments from women. The print is seersucker. The shoulder ties were a little difficult to tie and make look nice. This is great for a more casual event. I ordered it for my friend's summertime wedding rehearsal dinner and it's definitely too casual for that event. I would probably rent this again.","June 27, 2018","Work"

I'm usually a 6 or 8 in dresses and I wore a 6 to my event but the bodice was a bit loose. There's a lot of fabric in the skirt (it's a full circle skirt with a layer underneath) which made it a bit heavy but the fabric was breathable. Dress was a bit loose for a size 6 on me so I would suggest sizing down if you're usually between two sizes.","June 20, 2018","Large"

I wore it for a brunch and loved it. I liked that it wasn't skin tight so it didn't stick to my skin even though it was really hot. The zipper is not great. It required 4 hands and got stuck in the middle. I liked that the bows are adjustable so that I could lower the dress and customize the fit around my ribcage. The length was great since it didn't require me to be cautious of any activity-riding bikes, bending over, sitting on a high stool. I received many compliments and would gladly rent again. Since I'm petite I usually veer toward shorter hemlines but this one is so fun. It has a bounce like Baby's dress at the end of Dirty Dancing!","June 28, 2018","Party"

My favorite thing was how it felt very flowy around my legs as I walked, and the sear-sucker fabric is so light the skirt lifts out as you walk downstairs. Fit note - It runs just a tiny bit large. I generally wear either a 2 or a 4 so I would have expected the 2 to fit snugly around the waist, but it was pleasantly unrestrictive. It looked nipped in at the waist and I thing that is the intended fit. I would not size down. I have a long torso and the ties at the shoulders allow you to adjust the length just a bit so it his right at my natural waist.","June 27, 2018","Large"

The material is thick, so it felt great in that regard. The lace is gorgeous too. Many of the reviews said to size up, so I ordered a 6 & an 8 (I usually am a 4 or 6). I found the 6 to even be a little baggy. It wasn't horrible, so I still wore it, but I wish it was a bit tighter. Because of this paired with the length & long sleeves, it felt a little 'funeral' and not very wedding to me. I wore it any way and still got a ton of compliments.

I'm not usually a fan of fitted dresses but the lace detail alone is worth it. Don't be afraid of the sleeves being too tight, as there was a comfortable amount of room on top. However, curvier women should consider sizing up as it was very fitted in the hips and midsection, with no stretch in the fabric. You'll also want to take into consideration that this dress requires a strapless bra since the lace is sheer. Overall, it's the perfect way to make a statement while still staying fairly conservative.","August 3, 2017","Small"

I was comfortable all night and had ease of movement on the dance floor. This was my first rental with RTR and I can't wait for another occasion to rent again. Thanks so much for this service! The only con was that when I tried on the dress when I received it, it took my husband and daughter to help zip it up once it got to a certain point of the dress. For a $500 the zipper should zip with ease. THANKFULLY the day of the wedding the zipper went up just fine! Still 2 thumbs up for this dress.","January 16, 2017","Wedding"

The 14 was a little big, and I probably could've worn the 12, but I was getting ready by myself and couldn't get the 12 zipped up over the seam. It would've zipped, but I couldn't do it by myself.

The fabric is thick and hides all the lumps and bumps that another, thinner fabric may not. The fit was tight, but not uncomfortable and I felt ""held in"" all night. I did wear Spanx and an adhesive strapless bra underneath, which both worked perfect with this dress. I felt sexy, classy, and perfectly dressed for a nighttime wedding at a modern restaurant in the city. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because, like other reviewers have mentioned, that straps on the dress are a little long. I didn't feel I was ever coming out of the dress, but I did have to tug it up periodically throughout the night. This could probably be easily fixed with a few pins in the back, but I didn't want to fuss with anything else. Overall, was very happy with this backup dress.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW279","RTR Customer","Many compliments","Nice fit! Looks very classy on. Fully lined from the beginning of the breast piece down, so not too sexy or formal events. I'm very pale, and while I could tell the nude was much darker than my skin, most didn't think so. However, the waist was a little low for my natural waist, which made the dress ride up and fold. Because of the nude lining, it made it look like my gut stuck out over the dress in some photos. Breast panel was a bit short or my breasts, too, so if you wear a DDD or larger, beware that it might look like you have underboob (again, fully lined so it's not a real problem, but depends on where you're wearing the dress!).","January 5, 2019","True to Size"

However, I loved the look of the dress online so decided to take a chance... I was not disappointed. The dress fitted absolutely perfectly - bust, waist, hips, length, everything! It was a decent length and I felt quite conservative and certainly not like I had my ‘bits’ on display!! It is well made, substantial in the feel of the material and is clearly a better quality dress than your usual high street wedding fashions. It was so pretty from both the front and back views, and I had so many kind compliments on how it looked. The only issue I had was getting myself zipped up (impossible to do by oneself!).

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KP84","Jennifer","Received so many compliments on how beautiful and festive this dress was!","I normally fit into size Small dresses, but in this case I fit perfectly into the Medium size. This was such a lovely, elegant dress, and really flattering. I didn't have to wear any shapewear as the skirt is in layers, and the asymmetry was a nice touch. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Sturdy lace, and a completely separate shift underneath the lace layers. Definitely recommend! My only negatives - the gold ball beads are a nice detail and way to punch up the look of the dress, but they are sometimes a bit uncomfortable when sitting down... Also, as a heads up - I do not recommend wearing any bracelets with tines/etc. on them, as I rented one along with this dress and it frequently would get caught in the lace. Overall though, a wonderful, beautiful dress that I would gladly wear again!","December 17, 2018","Small"

I rented it for a Christmas Party at work and I soon as I took my coat off I received the first compliment. After this, the compliments were endless, even from people I did not know. After reading reviews I decided to rent the M and Large and I am glad I did. I am usually between S and M on dresses depending on the style (I have a really curvy shape) The M was a little long and lose around the armpits, but the slip underneath runs really small!!! Thank God I had the large to swap the slip from this size because otherwise, I would be showing my goodies!! I also wore black spanxs to feel more comfortable as I knew there was going to be a lot of dancing. I gave this dress 4 stars because the slip kept sliding up and my spanxs were showing (not noticeable due to the lace on the dress) but made me a little uncomfortable. If you are looking for a dress that stands out on its own, this is definitely the right option for you.

The dress fit very well. There is some stretch to the material. I am very short at just 5 ft but since it's cut to be a mini I didn't have to worry about the length. I do wear a 32 D bra so if you are short and small chested there's probably too much material on top to fit comfortably but for me personally it fit my chest perfectly and I didn't have to worry about any unwanted flashing even while dancing the night away. Only downside is by the end of the night the sequins do start to rub your skin raw around the edge of the chest/arm pit area.

The polka dot pattern was fun and different and a little bit stand-outish without making you feel like an outrageous attention whore. Pairs well with nude shoes and navy earrings. Highly recommended for wedding guests who love debating politics at the table, crashing other people's photo booth pics and trying every beer on the menu.

As you can see from the photo of it on the model, the waist is cut quite high. This means the part that fans out right under the waist sat pretty high on me and it just looked like I had a belly (which I don't have). I think this dress would be good if you have a naturally high waist.","January 21, 2018","True to Size"

It's probably one of my favorite RTR dresses of all time. The material is thicker, so perfect for winter and the neckline is flattering but not super low so perfect for a work function.

I received a lot of compliments in it, but it showed every line from my undergarments. The dress is tight, although very easy to move in, so I wore spanx and control top stockings, but you could definitely tell I was wearing them which was not ideal. Also, the material bunched up every time I sat down so I had to adjust the dress whenever I stood up. Overall, I wouldn't rent it again unless I tone up my whole body.","March 4, 2019","True to Size"

I loved the length, and the scoop back even works with a standard bra. The fabric wasnt itchy at all, which can sometimes be a concern with dresses that have some sparkle to them. The fabric definitely has a lot of stretch, but for me it wasn't too much to become unflattering. It was just incredibly comfortable.

Length was just above my knees (5'9) and would rise higher at times. It's flattering on curves but you may want spanx for your tummy if it will bother you to see it. I went with a strapless bra but you could probably wear a normal one. I just didn't want to risk straps showing. Fabric is Stretchy and not too itchy.

Cut really narrow in ribs just below the girls but above the waist... couldn’t zip last 2 inches of the Small.

This dress was the perfect color for a holiday party - the dark green on top of black was sultry and sexy while staying super classy. The fit was perfect, the deep v was complimented by the thicker straps. The skirt flared out and looked great when twirling on the dance floor. I'm really tall (5'11"") and the length was great, especially for my work holiday party. The back of the dress is a little longer than the front. The only thing I had to do that was kind of inconvenient was needing to tape the front of the v-neck down. Since I have smaller boobs (32C), I didn't fully fill out the front so I imagine someone with bigger boobs would fill it out better, but having the fashion tape was perfect and made me feel much more secure.

Not only was it super plunging, but the straps were very loose, so it would have been a wardrobe malfunction waiting to happen. Luckily I ordered a black lace bandeau from Amazon ($12!) added a safety pin and I was good to go. The dress definitely doesn't have a lot of give, so I had to size up to the M.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PPC16","Lo","Eye catching dress even distracted people from my fracture book!","This dress is incredible! It's #glamorous but also #comfy. I'd been put in a fracture boot a bit before the wedding and people were so obsessed with the color, fabric, and cut of the dress that they almost didn't know the fracture boot below. I have a narrow frame and a small chest and found the cut to be no issue at all- even when dancing. I also loved that it was loose enough in the waist that I could enjoy all the wedding food without worrying about whether or not that would impact the look. I paired with bold earrings and a cocktail ring which I would recommend. If you're between two sizes, I'd recommend going for the smaller. I'm between a 0 and a 2 and the xs fit true to size. Overall, I would absolutely recommend renting this dress!","October 17, 2018","Wedding"

It does run a bit big, I'm normally a Small, sometimes medium due to height, but I wore an XS. I was able to wear it without a bra, always a plus, and it stayed put very well.

I am a 32C and thank god for Victoria Secret low cut body suit and lots of tape! Otherwise you would be popping out! Not sure how a bigger or smaller bust would fit honestly, but once in it, it looked fantastic and the fabric was high quality.

The fit is a little weird, I have a large bust and the straps felt big. Not sure if the intent is for the dress to be super plunging neckline? I pinned the straps back to help support the girls and wore a little bralette, just in case. I could have gone without pinning the dress, but everything felt a little more secure when I did. Definitely a cleavagey dress, but ain't nothing wrong with that. Overall, cute dress LOVED the color, while the fit wasn't perfect it's definitely workable.","August 29, 2018","True to Size"

The dress was absolutely perfect! I normally wear a 2-4 and had to go for the extra small to get my bust feeling secure. I was a little nervous at first-felt a little exposed with all that cleavage. But it honestly felt super comfortable once I relaxed a bit. It was a bit tight around my ribcage, but in a way that made me feel tucked and secure. Used two pieces of tape to keep everything in place and hit the dance floor. I would order it again!","August 27, 2018","Large"

The small fit my waist perfectly and the length was great. The only issue I had was how long the torso/straps were. I had to pin them up almost 2 inches to get the top of the dress to fit. Double-sided tape is definitely your friend with this dress! I used a bit of tape at my shoulders after pinning to keep everything PG. It's a great dress, but unless you're at least 5'6""/have a much larger chest be prepared to temporarily pin the straps.","June 10, 2018","Wedding"

I am between a size 2 & a 4, but I tried the 2P because that was available. The fit was perfect, and I think the 4 would have been too large for my smaller bust. Overall I didn't love it simply because it did not feel like ""me."" You can tell in my body language in the photo that I'm not comfortable in it.

It was perfect for the formal event we attended and I received so many compliments. Good quality, has rouching in the middle to create a very flattering look. I was a little nervous about renting because I’m 4’11”, so length is always a concern. This was my backup, and so glad I picked it. My first choice was too long. This one seemed to run a little small. But, with the help of a corset and my hubby, we got it zipped. The dress brushed the floor, even with 5” heels, so I had pick it up to walk comfortably. It also has a small train which added to the gorgeous look, but I had to remember to pick it up to dance. The dress is on the heavy side, because of the sequins, so I found myself pulling it up now and again, and the sequins got a little scratchy under the arm by the end of the night. Great experience and will rent in the future.","February 25, 2019","Formal Affair"

Good thing I did! I tried on the 6 and it was very tight. I could've squeezed into it but knowing I would be uncomfortable and had a second size available I decided to wear the 8. It was much more comfortable however still form fitting. I was wearing tights underneath because it was very cold out and I kept feeling like you could see where the tights held snug around my waist. If it was warmer I definitely would have gone without them. I liked how the back had a v shape since the front comes up high like a boat neck.

This dress had the right amount of stretch and was very comfortable and did not require a nonstandard bra. I did wear spanx but didn't really need to- I could have worn the 12 but the 14 was only a tiny bit bigger and was more comfortable.

The dress has double zippers. I was worried if it would unzip from the bottom while walking or sitting and it didn't. It was like it only had one zip. It does become short (like any other dress) when you sit but it depends on what your comfortable with. I received plenty of compliments throughout the night.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF49","Christina","Classy, elegant, yet fun and sexy","This dress has some elastic give, which was exactly why I got it over a few other very pretty lace options I looked at. I wanted to be able to dance and not be uncomfortable knowing I was going to wear it from 1 pm- 11 pm, eating and dancing. Pros: elastic give; straight cut that was flattering; beautiful lace detail across the neckline, sleeve and bottom edge, with solid, lacy body; V-detail in the back; can wear regular bra (yay!!); good length. Any shorter would be an issue. Cons: Ran small in my book. I am consistently a size 0 in RTR (and have even worn a 0P) and other brands; I wear a size 25 jeans typically and am 107 lbs. So I ordered a 0 and 2 for the back up. The 0 was laughably tight. The 2 was a skin tight option and a hair short--perfect if it was a bachelorette party or if I was in Vegas. I called RTR and they sent the size 4 complimentary plus shipping to my hotel I was at, and it was PERFECT. Fit like a dream and was there when I arrived, having flown across the country.

They allowed me to pick a second back-up last minute. The original dress I wanted wasn't available, and at the time I didn't put too much thought into the back-up I first picked, thinking I wouldn't need it (whoops!). The original back-up dress was much too formal for a country-style wedding. So I did some quick browsing, and found this gem! I was a little self-conscious at first, as it isn't very forgiving in the tummy area. I did wear spanx in the beginning, but those did not last long, haha, I felt way too restricted. The dress is just so beautiful that you quickly learn to let go of the itty bitty flaws of yo-self, because you'll feel like a queen in this dress. I received many compliments. Being so short (5' 0""), it was really nice to have a dress that was actually kinda short on me (for once in my life). Not like ""I'm goin' clubbin'"" short, but just short enough to be sexy, hitting about mid-thigh. The lace detailing is beautiful. But I do agree with most of the other ladies on here... size up. I'm usually a size 4, but I went with a 6, and it seriously fit like a glove. The sleeves weren't too tight, and it zipped right up effortlessly. However, had I gone with a 4, it probably would have been a struggle to get in it, or I would have been uncomfortable all night. Again, this dress was wonderful, so far my favorite one from RTR, it was hard to give her back. You won't be disappointed in this one.","October 24, 2017","Small"

It does run short, I'm 5'5"" and wore flats since I was running around on my feet for 16 hours (prego probs) so the length worked for my needs but heels of any height would have made it too short - get the Long if you are wearing heels.

I received an email that my dress would be one day late. I called to ask about it and they told me that my dress was out of stock. I was so upset. They sent me another dress which I wasn't too happy with because I was a bridesmaid! I finally got a ""shipped"" email and apparently the girl on the phone was an idiot because my original order still shipped. My dress came and I ordered a 6 R and an 8R. They honestly both fit the same, but the 8 R was a little longer. I chose to wear the 6R. I received so many compliments, it was crazy! Everyone loved the dress. It was beautiful and very true to the champagne (light gold) color. My only complaint or con is that on one side of the dress, where the zipper is, the sequins let rubbing against my arm, so all night I kept messing with it, the next day I had a red spot on my arm and it looked like minor scratches due to the rubbing of the sequins against my arm. Other than that, the dress was gorgeous! I would get a good backless bra, my bra was just hose silicone pads that you stick on, not the best choice","October 3, 2016","Wedding"

My breast's are au natural so normally I need tape in dresses like this to pull them up and keep them in place but this dress I didn't need any support. I would go a size down not a size up when ordering. Maybe dresses are bigger because they are rentals and worn more because normally a 6 would be snug on my breast area!

There was a little extra room for me in the waist and hips, which was nice for dancing and indulging in wedding food, although I realize this may not be true for everyone.

I sized up from normal; the 6 technically fit but was tighter than I like, especially around the chest. The 8 felt appropriate but still fitted and flattering. The arm holes were a tad low so I used some tape to make sure my bra didn't show. Wore strapless bra. I think it's best accessorized with nice earrings as the ruffle doesn't need a necklace. Great length too (I'm 5'2""). Definitely recommend!","August 15, 2019","Wedding"

The 6 bust and hips were both a little tight and the material around the hips rode up a bit. Still, overall it was a nice date night dress, with more give than I expected after a big dinner.

Also, there are underwires that run up and down the entire length of the bodice in the front and the back.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM446","Kimberlee","Exquisite","Without the reviews, I wouldn't have taken a chance on this dress. Thank you, ladies. A less expensive dress of this style would most likely be loose fitting and fraught with under garment challenges. Also too, I am short and so I wasn't sure about the length. However, the outward illusion of elegant wisp is held together by a no nonsense infrastructure. The sleeves stay put, a bra is unnecessary, and a simple spanx or in my case nude, toeless control top (invisible) leg wear worked perfectly. The shorter length in the front gave the illusion of height and the regular 4 did not drag too much with my heels. The bold color drew attention and many compliments from strangers. The only issue was a pesky underwire that dug into my ribs. I probably could have avoided this had I given it attention while dressing. I could imagine pairing this with purple or yellow shoes, but I chose black. I wore this dress to the opera and it did not disappoint. Beautiful!","August 25, 2018","Formal Affair"

I have small boobs and a big butt/thighs so I wasn't sure if this was going to be too tight around the waist but it's made of stretchy fabric that complimented my curves perfectly. The ruffles also hid my belly well which made me extra confident. I was worried the off the shoulder would make it hard to dance but the straps on the arms are stretchy and very easy to move around in. There's a built in bra but I still wore a strapless underneath it just for extra support. With 3.5"" heels the dress just touched the floor so I had to pick it up once in awhile as I walked but otherwise the length wasn't a problem.

I never once felt like I was going to trip over the dress. My only suggestion for this dress would be to wear a regular nude/sheer bra. I bought a sticky bra thinking that I would need that for the back of the dress, when a regular bra would have made me look better. There is a somewhat built in bra, but I would only recommend that for a small bust size. With a full B or higher cup size, try the dress with a regular bra.","August 15, 2018","True to Size"

The second was blue hi/lo, both in 10 R. I had read all the reviews because of my size, shape. The zippers were hard and they stuck (which was stated numerous times) but I didn't remember reading they were snug through the middle. They were and the blue was a heavy gown ( I think I remember reading that, also). I called customer service on Friday at 1p, the day before my event. They didn't have the gold in the next size, so she sent me two sizes in another of my favorites that arrived the day of my event at 1030am! So impressed with customer service. Those were just too much sequins for me. I went with the very first and just wore a lot of Spanx. Also, there were at least 3 other of the same sequined dress at the event. Maybe, there could be a way to ask what event the renter is attending so there won't be the duplication. Overall, as a first timer this was a great experience.","March 25, 2018",""

I rented this for my friends evening October wedding in Ohio. Both the 6 & 8 fit; had I been willing to wear shapewear all night I would've worn the 6... but it was BBQ wedding food so I opted to wear the 8 & not worry about it. As other reviews stated, the lining was longer than the overlay, but I figured some double sided tape would fix that easily. When I tried it on with heels, I realized it was definitely not long enough for the look I was going for so I ended up wearing flat sandals instead and it worked out great. I got tons of compliments on the dress, and was very comfortable all night. I would say that if you have broad shoulders or very muscular biceps, this might be a little tight. My movement was slightly limited but it wasn't bad at all and I barely noticed as the night went on. I would absolutely recommend this dress & might rent again!","October 22, 2017","Wedding"

The dress fit perfectly and all of the bridesmaids loved the dress. It looked beautiful in pictures and I got so many compliments! A few things though: another bridesmaid ordered the same dress in a different size and the inner lining was longer than the outside fabric. (Not with my dress -- it was a good length! But just wanted to share and give a heads up) And since it is very fitting, the zipper is a bit hard to zip and sometimes it felt like it was going to break.

Other reviewers had also mentioned this. Also the underslip had significant staining all over it which translated to a few dark shadowed areas on the dress which were barely noticeable. I reported this to RTR customer service and they were very understanding about it! Overall, I felt great in this dress! It was super comfortable and hugged my curves in all the right places. Will definitely RTR again!","November 14, 2016","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DM37","Jordan","Pretty details. Great length for petites.","Luckily a 4R was available, the fit was perfect. I wore comfortable 2.5 inch heels and had my sister pin the dress up a tiny bit and it worked out great. The details feel subtle but definitely impressionable. A modest but sexy fit. Felt glamorous and pretty as a bridesmaid.","November 6, 2016","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DM37","Cassie","Sparkling Bridesmaid","One of my best friends got married recently and asked that all of her bridesmaids wear long, gold RTR gowns. Unfortunately, even though I rented a 4R, this dress was a little tight (but doable) but way too short. I'm only 5'4"" had to wear my shortest heels, and the dress was still awkwardly short. You can't tell from this photo, but you could see my entire shoe below the dress. I'm not sure if someone hemmed this dress or if I was just accidentally sent a 4P? Maybe rent an L just in case. Other than that, the whole RTR experience was a great one for all of the bridesmaids and I will definitely rent again.","November 6, 2016","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DM37","RTR Customer","Classic and Comfortable","Fit very well. 4L was form fitting but a bit short with 3 1/2"" heels. 6L still fit beautifully and was long enough. It did have more shine than expected, which was welcome! Built in bra cups, so no bra was needed. Lining does hang lower than the lace but it didn't bother me. Classically simple yet elegant dress for bridesmaids. I am also 4 months pregnant when I wore this and there was plenty of room for my mini bump. Highly recommend!","September 4, 2016","Wedding"

This was exactly that. Not only did it look incredible on every body type, but it photographed so well. They just shimmered and there were so many compliments on them. The girls did say that they ran a little bit small in the chest area (so if you have a larger chest, maybe order a size up as your second size) and the hemline of the dresses on some were a little bit worn. Otherwise, everything was absolutely perfect!","April 29, 2016","Small"

The 8R wasn't gonna work even if it fit because the inner length of the dress was longer than the actual lace of the dress.

Such a fun wear. Million compliments! Light and flowy, great material, doesn't feel cheap. I have thicker thighs and some booty, and consider myself a pear, so it was a little tight on bottom half, (which ended up being flattering still showing off curves) but the midsection was a little baggy and fit nicely around breasts. I'm 34C. I used the straps but didn't need them. It hit above ankle and flowed very well when moving. I had so much fun going for cocktails, and walking Fremont Street. People literally stopped me to say the loved it! I'll rent again and again! P.S. Ladies be sure to check the pocket inside the bag for the belt. I've seen some people say it wasn't included with shipping, but I've found most ties, belts etc. are always in there. Just a helpful hint in the future ladies.","September 20, 2018","True to Size"

The overall fit was kind of large...I felt like the sleeve straps were too big and I couldn't adjust them so I just tucked them in so I didn't have to mess with them all night.

I found it a tad bit short-waisted, but I also have a long torso. It didn't come with the belt, so I'm thankful I had a skinny red belt I could add to the outfit.

I ordered a small and a medium as my back up, and ended up wearing the medium (I couldn't even zip up the small). I tucked in the spaghetti straps and just wore it off the shoulders (more trendy that way). The only problem with the dress is that there is no stretch, so it was hard to bend over. It would ride up a bit at points but nothing too bad. Also you have to bring a friend to the bathroom with you. But I still loved it, and if it had a little bit of stretch to it I would totally buy it! Also a bonus that RTR shipped it 3 days early.

This piece felt like a little bit of a risk for me- It seemed too bold for my usual taste, but as always when I wear RTR, I got tons of compliments, and I felt confident in it. Other reviews said the fabric felt lightweight and good for a hot summer day, but in an un-air-conditioned restaurant in the middle of a hazy, smoky heat wave (90 degrees in Seattle), I still felt like I was melting (although it was OK outside). Overall, it was perfect for the event, and I while I don't have any need to own it or wear it again, I am so glad I got the chance to wear it once!","August 10, 2017","True to Size"

The zipper was awful and I had to have my friends take me to the bathroom during a party where we were drinking. Sooo getting stuck in this romper was less than ideal. The fabric was very stiff with no give. I would say it's a standing outfit to look pretty. Not a sitting do anything outfit.","August 8, 2017","Party"

It worked for both a day at the office and a rooftop engagement party - and the compliments were pouring in! The fabric feels like a lightweight linen and is loose enough that it's cool and comfortable for a summer party. The waist was fitted, but not too tight. The pants and sleeves both had a pretty loose fit without being baggy, and the off the shoulder style wasn't at all restricting on my arms like it can be on other pieces. The color and print on this jumpsuit are unbeatable if you're looking for something fun. The only issue I had was getting it on and off - I needed to ask for help before using the restroom! This is a piece that would work for all sorts of summer events.","July 11, 2017","Party"

I was afraid it was going to look weird since I have a shorter frame but it's one of those outfits that looks good at any height. I received and XS and a S and the small didn't have the belt (someone either lost it or forgot to return it) and I could see how that could happen. NOTE: it took me about 5 minutes to unzip the outfit while using the restroom, then take the belt off. And then I had to do that all over again If you're going to be using the bathroom a lot, you may want to ditch the belt so you don't lose it.

I loved the open back, no bra needed as the fabric is sturdy. Only flaw (other than length!) was that my torso was just a little too short... when I stood up straight, it looked great, but if I stood like I normally do, the fabric bunched a little on the side.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK148","Rachel","Elegant","Felt like a million bucks! I would recommend wearing a size or two large in this dress for two reasons. 1. The fit is snug and choosing a size that is more loose still gives the desired silhouette without sacrificing comfort. 2. The truth is that the dress is slightly used and the if it is to tight it could damage the zipper.","November 26, 2017","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK148","Lauren","Simple, elegant, conservative","So... my boss and I rented the same dress. Crisis averted because she wore her back up style, buuuuut I think there should be a way to see if anyone else in the area rented the same dress during the same time frame. That aside, RTR is amazing and so easy! My favorite part about RTR is being able to see what the dress looks like on REAL people. I rented this dress (and another) for a work charity gala. This was my back up dress and I didn't wear it to the gala, but I wanted to review it anyway because it is a beautiful gown. This is a good choice for heavy chested gals who want to be a little more conservative, especially for a work function. I like the cap sleeves because I'm a little self conscious about my arms. The dress is light weight, but the fabric is thick enough to smooth/hide little imperfections. I always wear shape-wear under dresses like this to make sure everything stays put. I'm 5'6.5"" and after reading other reviews I decided to order the long. If you're in between reg/long like me just remember, you can always wear higher heels! I had on 5 inch heels and the length was perfect. Personally, I would've worn a statement necklace with this dress since the top half is a little plain. The dress doesn't have any stretch to it, so I would get one size up if you have a larger chest. I'm 36DD and I know I should have. This dress would be perfect for a holiday party and I would consider renting it again... but only if I lost a couple lbs so that I could breathe comfortably. :-)","September 22, 2017","Formal Affair"

A few thoughts: material of dress is super thick and well made, it's a bit more forgiving to imperfections. The zipper is pretty tricky and I have a shorter waist so it was pretty tight in the middle for me. If I had more time, I would have tried an 8 to see if it was a better fit.

I was initially worried that it wasn't formal enough for the gala I was attending, but the detailing on the sleeves and the subtle, metallic sheen on the red/flower portions on the skirt really dress it up (especially with the right statement necklace/accessories!). Definitely glad that I was sent the 12L, which turned out to be the perfect length (5'7"", plus 3"" heels).

Very comfortable and not just ""another black dress"" at the gala! I fit both the 2 and the 4. Wore the 4 because it gave me a little extra room at the shoulders.

I wore 4 inch heels and I hemmed it 2 inches and it was floor length. It looks quite plain on the website but I added the Marchesa eternal garden necklace which just completed the dress so well and turned it into an awesome piece.

The 6R fit perfectly; it was not too snug around my waist or chest (always a concern), and the skirt hung nicely off of my frame. The recommended size chart said that I should order the Long due to my height, but I only wore 2"" heels, and the Regular nearly skimmed the floor.

I could easily sit down and walk in this dress. I'm 5'4"" with 4 inch heels and it was still a bit long. The cap sleeves did not alter arm movement as sometimes they can.

The belt loops were missing so I had to pin the belt, otherwise it would have flapped open. Also be careful if you're large-chested; I'm a 36D and it was very tight across my chest, creating a weird pressed look from the side.

I initially ordered the 4L and 6L and had them shipped directly to my hotel. The 6L fit great, but was too long for me. Even with almost 4"" heels, it was dragging the floor. I was afraid of stepping on the dress all night, so I called RTR to see if they had a 6R available, and they did! They overnighted the new dress and it arrived the day of my event. Based on my height and heels, I believe the 6R length was perfect. As others have stated, the fabric is thick enough so I did not need a bra (score!). The fabric does not really have much give, so I did find bending over to pick something up had to be done gently. Also, the belt was just shy of reaching the side loop to tuck the extra, so a piece of double-sided tape or a safety pin may be necessary. Overall, I loved this dress!","September 16, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS18","Lisa","Black tie optional","Felt very (almost too) sexy in this sleek black dress! I'm usually a size 4 and the 6 fit snug, similar to other dresses by this brand. I am 5-5"" and wore 3"" heels and the regular length worked well, although may have been a touch too long. The thigh slit does come up pretty high when seated. I'm probably a little too busty (34DD) to have been wearing such a large v-neck split. I was able to wear an unlined bralette with a halter neckline underneath for support but beware - outside of miraculously having this bralette you will not be able to wear a strapless bra or bustier with this dress. Even the nubra cups I bought originally were visible through the slit. The belt did loosen on me throughout the night with movement, and the excess material won't lay flat so it was visible from the side in pictures, though that didn't bother me. If you're going for sexy and formal without being too fancy (read: black tie optional) this is a great choice!","August 28, 2017","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS18","RTR Customer","Showstopper at high school reunion - compliments all night!","My original reserved dress for this event was another Cinq a Sept but a few weeks before, RTR sent me an email saying that they could not send it, so I chose this dress as my replacement. It worked out wonderfully! The fit was true to size and I wore it without a bra (I'm not sure that it would have zipped up all the way if I had worn a bra, but keep in mind that while I am not busty, I have a broad chest and shoulders. A gal with a more average or petite frame probably wouldn't have any issues with wearing a bra). I am average height and got the Regular instead of the Long and I thought that it worked out fine with my shorter heels (maybe like 2 inches). Wrinkles came out very easily with my steamer. My only complaint is in regards to the belt that comes with the dress, which is the reason that this gets 4 stars instead of 5. The dress has one attached belt loop to keep the belt secure, but it does not hold the belt's excess fabric in place so I kept having to adjust it all night. I should have utilized a safety pin on the belt. Other than that, this dress is amazing and all of my old friends said that I looked fantastic. Would highly recommend this dress if you are looking to stand out and impress a crowd.","July 10, 2017","True to Size"

Even that just barley zipped comfortably, but the husband said it still looked good (of course he did). The dress is a lovely cut, made with a nice fabric that offers stretch. It could be dressed up for a very formal event, or be equally appropriate for a more low-key affair. You can't wear anything under this without it showing. I wore a strapless body suit to keep everything underneath in place. I even added a backless/strapless bra for extra lift, because the chest area is on full display. This would be ideal for a woman with a smaller chest. The only annoyance was that the shoulders kept wanting to slide down all night.","September 17, 2018","Formal Affair"

I ended up going with my backup size of a 6, and the fit was similar, and I felt more comfortable to move all night. It's a heavy fabric, but a fun pattern that looks more colorful in different lighting. I wore high heels, and since it is shorter in the front than the back, didn't trip much.

A little longer than on the the model because I am only 5 foot 4 inches and curvy so the larger size caused the dress to be longer. I would recommend the 14P but the 14R was the only one available.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL14","Mary cathryn","So elegant with an edgy vibe!","I really liked my rental of this dress. I was 14 weeks pregnant and had no problems with my little bump fitting in the dress. I would not recommend this for larger chested girls though. I'm well endowed to begin with (36D), but with the swelling due to pregnancy, the dress was almost too tight up top. I didn't clasp the inside corset because it would've been uncomfortable. If I were to rent it again I would go one more size up (I wore the 10). The dress never fell down though (ha)!! The pockets were great for storing my phone, lipstick, a room key, and some cash! I also loved that the bottom front was short and showcased my shoes. Perfect for shoe lovers!! The material is thick but not too hot (I wore this in September) and it felt very expensive. I eventually changed into flats and the dress did drag the floor in the back just a little (I'm 5'7). I would recommend renting this dress. It's beautiful and fun!","September 12, 2016","Formal Affair"

But more bad ass.","In dresses I can vary from a size 2 to 6 depending on the cut, style, fit, etc., and in this dress I was a 2. The fabric is on the heavier side, so I sized down, which helped me feel more comfortable that the dress would stay up. The dress has great boning, and essentially an inner corset. I was able to dance all night without worry. This dress is a slight high-low cut, which I didn't notice before. I loved it, great for showing off shoes.","September 5, 2016","Large"

I'm on the taller side and with heels it was just at the floor might be a tiny bit long if you don't wear heels.","July 15, 2016","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL14","Michelle","The dress fit perfectly especially for a shorter person!","The dress fit well and I felt beautiful in it. Being 5'1"" I often struggle finding a dress that doesn't need shortening. Although this dress is midi length on taller women this dress was perfect floor length on me! The front hit right at my ankles showing off my shoes and left a small train behind me. The dress also had pockets which is always a win in formalwear. The only negative I can say is the boning was in both the front and back and the back boning dug into me a little bit. The zipper was also a bit difficult where the upper and lower sections of the dress came together. I would definitely recommend the dress especially if you are short and looking for a formal gown!","June 19, 2016","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CED61","RTR Customer","So odd it feels very edgy and fashionable","At first, the dress feels a little strange - weighed down in unexpected places - but this passes quickly and it was actually very comfortable. I chose it as an emergency backup option when an item was unavailable, and while it wasn't appropriate for the evening event I was RTRing for, it turned out to be perfect for a daytime dressy work event where I didn't want to emphasize any curves--and believe me, it won't. You won't want this for a hot date, but it is interesting to the point of being so unusual it looks very fashionable, edgy, and avant garde. Remember that scene in the Little Mermaid when Ariel washes ashore, newly with human legs, and realizes she's naked? Flounder and Scuttle quickly fashion her a dress of discarded sailcloth and rope? THIS IS THAT DRESS. I enjoyed wearing it once. It was really different from other dresses...but I have no qualms about sending it back for the next person to try.","March 3, 2020","True to Size"

It's definitely a look that will stand out and draws attention. I wore this to a spring day time party where most women were in floral a-line dresses. This got tons of compliments from other women and I loved it. I also wore it layered with a blazer to work. Another thing i loved is that, unlike a lot of more unusual cut clothing, this dress actually worked on me as a petite/smaller framed person. At 5'3, it's more ankle length than midi but I wasn't swallowed by too much fabric. It's also a comfortable, breathable fabric that works in both sunny outdoors and air conditioned office. Only negative is it wrinkles when sitting. Would buy if it was less $$","April 22, 2019","Party"

To be fair, it may have looked better if I got one size down, but then I feel like the black band across the chest would have bit slightly too constricting. The material felt like a parachute or something. The swing of the dress was nice, but even the colors just looked so... off.

A huge pro is that you can wear a regular bra underneath it! It was a little bit short for me at 6'1"" and my feet were poking out at the bottom with flats on.

With no stretch in the fabric and a tighter fit in the bust, this dress is better for smaller cup sizes. This gown is fitted at the waist and hip area, so if you’re curvier, you may want to consider sizing up. One thing that I love about this dress is the lace detailing at the neckline; however you would have to wear a NuBra or no bra for this look. At 58” from shoulder to hem, this gown is perfect to wear with heels for a gala or black tie wedding. Pair it with silver jewelry and any color heels.","November 4, 2016","True to Size"

I wish I would have sized up for my back up dress solely because of the belt. By the end of the night it was very restrictive. I received a lot of compliments on the dress and would rent again if it wasn't for the belt! Also the skirt has no stretch its fairly tight but I didn't find it to be a problem.

That said, the back is slightly low, so I decided to use a low-back Spanx for cup support instead of a strapless bra. The Spanx fabric kept getting stuck to the interior of the dress, and the entire dress would shift and twist so the zipper and slit was off-center. I ended up dumping the Spanx about ten minutes into the reception (used a regular bra with stuffed-in back instead), and was better off for it. My mistake for waiting until the last minute to try the dress on with my chosen undergarments, but figured it's worth a warning for other renters.","December 28, 2018","True to Size"

It showed my ""baby bump"" and despite the Spanx, I still felt like I looked unattractive. The color is more muted than I hoped - more of a blue red than an orange red. It was tough to find a bra for this dress because of the cut out in the back so I ended up going bra-less.

Also, I would suggest Spanx (I'm so glad I wore them!). My favorite detail is the open back! I was initially concerned about the slit in the back, but it was modest (at least for my height). Keep in mind that since this is a rental, it is possible that the top of the dress may be stretched out from previous wearers (the issue I had with the dress), so it would have been impossible for me to wear a necklace with this.

I prefer my clothes to fit a little loose over being a little snug, so I wore the 8 when I typically wear a size 6. I love the color, the lace, and the length of this dress.

My husband's brother was getting married, so it was important not to show off too much skin in front of my in laws at the rehearsal dinner. The dress hit me right above the knee. I love how it was modest, not showing any cleavage, but with a sexy back cut out. This dress does not have any give, and it was lined with a satin lining. To flatten things out in the tummy area, I did wear a spankx undergarment, like really tight shorts. I wore a nude color strapless bra. And lastly, I wore nude close toe pumps. This dress was just such a classy look and perfect for the dinner, which was in an upscale restaurant. I felt like Charlotte from Sex in the City. The event also took place in early December, so the red dress was fitting for that time of year.","April 27, 2017","True to Size"

I was nervous the dress would be too tight so I ordered the next size up (size 4) but it was too big. The 2 fit perfectly. The back neck part laid flat which was a concern for me since I am petite sometimes features like that tend to sag on me. I am so pleased I rented this dress.","April 3, 2017","True to Size"

The colors on this dress are beautiful, the material is a great lightweight for the summer but the hem was so incredibly short that I felt like my lady parts were going to peek out if I crossed my legs too quickly - or uncrossed them! I wore the XL in order to make the length work because the replacement turnaround time was too risky for my event's timing. I found the belt to be very difficult to maneuver correctly.

I also recommend using a safety pin or fashion tape to secure the dress where it overlaps around the mid-thigh-- it was windy at the wedding and the two halves of the dress don't overlap quite as much as I wanted.

Couple things worth noting: It requires ironing and there is NO stretch around your rib cage. So, the dress felt fine at the start of the night, but after two sushi rolls it was very uncomfortable. Also, you MUST wear a slip because this material is see through. I really enjoyed wearing this dress but would never pay retail price to own it.

This style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a strapless bra since the dress is strapless/off the shoulder. At 5'0"", the length hit floor length on me. The dress is perfect for the pool side or the beach but be aware that the piece in the midsection is very tight, with no stretch. Pair with sandals and a cute accessory to complete your outfit!","May 26, 2018","Small"

I would have liked to try a size up to see what that felt like, but it wasn't available. My only area of fit issue was the rib cage area, so if you have wider ribs, that is something to keep in mind.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BC108","Julissa","Classy with edge","Loved this dress, got so many compliments! The neckline is not something I would normally gravitate towards but I decided to take a risk based on the other positive reviews and it definitely paid off. Such a flattering fit- the neckline and sheer panels are edgy but the shape of the dress is very classic, fit and flare throughout the skirt. The sheer panels are also high enough on your torso that you can still wear spanx if you want without them showing through. The neckline dips low though and the cutouts in the neckline are wide enough that if you're really busty this may not be the best option. I will say the length was a little annoying- I'm just about 5'7 and without heels the length of the regular was perfect and with it was maybe 1/2 and inch-1 inch too short- but the length of the long was 3 inches longer so it would have been wayyy too long without heels. I wore the regular with about 3 inch heels and it was fine- not perfect but perfect-enough!","February 1, 2016","True to Size"

The bottom part of the lace, on hip area has a nude insert, but the ones on top do not. It's classy, but also a bit sexy without too much. I got tons of complements all night!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BC108","Rebecca","Weird fit, but still looked okay in pics!","I rented this dress for a black-tie optional Christmas party. It really is a beautiful dress, but the fit was really weird on me. I am 5'9"" and about 135 lbs, usually a 4-6 in dresses, and ordered the 4L and 6L. First of all, I think the dress ran a little short, so I would absolutely not recommend for anyone 5'9"" and above. It appeared a little longer in the back than in the front on me, but not in the model photos. Second, the 4L was a little tight on my hips...but so was the 6L! The only difference was that the 6L was much bigger on top, so I ended up wearing the 4L even though it felt tight on the hips. To be honest the 4L was a little big on top too, but I do have a small bust. It looked okay in pictures, but scrutinizing myself in the mirror it definitely fell across my hips weirdly. So moral of the story: do NOT rent if you have hips!!! It would have looked (and felt) really great on someone with slimmer hips, but it just did not fit right on a more hourglass figure.","December 17, 2015","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BC108","Mandy","Fun, formal holiday party with a friend. Dress was perfect, in spite of the snow.","Received this dress as replacement/backup. Thank goodness for the overnight delivery and the very helpful customer service rep who suggested it based on my size, color preference, etc. I wore the 4R which was a little shorter than I'd have liked but I felt that with 3"" heels, the 4L would have likely been too long. It seems that 5'6"" is on the cusp of 4R & 4L depending on the dress. I don't enjoy wearing a lot of jewellery, so the neckline was perfect for me as it added some visual interest without embellishments. The dress was a little snug in the hip area but I feel the 6 would have been too large. I didn't need to wear a bra and the ""push-up"" effect of the dress made the fit even more flattering.","December 14, 2015","True to Size"

When I saw the picture online, I was not impressed and not excited to wear it. But when it arrived, I loved the details that made the dress really special. There are three lacy panels on each side. The top two panels are sheer but the lower panel has nude colored fabric behind it. The unique shape of the top is very sexy but sophisticated. It is very low-cut in the front and because I'm an A-cup the fabric puckered out a bit and exposed more than I'm comfortable with so I was pretty self-conscious throughout the night. I would not recommend this dress for anyone with less than a B-cup unless you have a special bra or double sided tape to use (which I didn't).","April 21, 2015","True to Size"

It runs true to size, but I would recommend sizing up for backup especially if you're curvier. An important thing to note is that you need a backless bra with this style if you choose to wear a bra. The fabric has a bit of stretch to it, which helps hold everything in. I tried on the 2R, but would have preferred the 2L (I'm 5'7'). Would recommend pairing this style with statement earrings and/or a cuff. Great choice for a black tie event, prom, wedding, etc!","April 10, 2015","True to Size"

I got so many compliments and even someone said I looked like I lost weight (I actually had gained ha) but the dress hugs at the perfect places to give curves. The added ruffle at the bottom is a nice touch and is sophisticated, not childish. The small fit me snugly but because I went to a fundraiser that was featuring cuisine from around the world, I opted for the medium to account for all the eating and food baby :) The color is as pictured, a beautiful wine color. Only complaint is my bra did show on both sizes slightly on the side but could just have been my bust size and I didn't have time to find a bra that could be hidden. I can't remove a star just because of how happy I am with the dress. Will definitely rent again!!!","October 24, 2018","Other"

There was plenty of stretch in the dress which made it great for dancing! The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the smell of the dress. The size small that I wore smelled like it hadn't been cleaned after someone wore it all night and sweat in it! I tried to mask the smell, but it was still a little disappointing as I was worried people would smell me!","October 3, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TW7","Susan","Super comfortable and cute!","Loved the dress! Got multiple compliments. The only issue was that I had to wear the backup size (xs) because the small had been previously damaged and they must’ve tried to repair it. Right by my belly the top layer must’ve snagged or ripped and they sewed it. It was bunched and looked weird. Luckily, I was able to squeeze into the xs. It was pretty snug, but I think it still worked well for me. I had a baby 4 months ago and I still felt pretty! If you are a small and want this dress, take heed for the damaged dress. Hopefully they have multiple smalls in stock and will see this to take the damaged one off the circuit.","September 25, 2018","True to Size"

All the little details really make it come together as an interesting wear. The fabric is really nice and structured, without being too confining. I liked the see-through shoulder stripe and the ruffle along the hip. It's not something I would usually pick out, but ended up really liking the fit. The stretchy-yet-strong fabric took away the need for a bra, though I could have used some more room for my chest, as I got more of a sports bra effect.","February 8, 2019","True to Size"

Its comfortable for any bust size and there is comfortable room in the midsection area. Curvier women should consider sizing up especially if they have full hips. I recommend wearing your true size and sizing up for your backup size. At 5’3 this dress hits knee length for me.","February 1, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK304","Diane","Classy Dress","This dress is very classy with just a few sexy hints (a small sheer cut-out in the front and a little leg slit). It is perfect for those that need to dress conservative to an event, but still want something that is form fitting and has little hints of something more. I am a perfect size six and it fit me perfect - however, you may need to pull the dress over your head instead of stepping into it. The dress lining is very soft and silky, making it comfortable to wear. The dress hit me right below the knee, however, the slit goes up to right above the knee. Because of the sheer cut-out that extends from the front to back, you will need to wear a strapless bra with this dress. I really wish I had gotten to wear this dress... It unfortunately arrived a day late and after I had already left for my evening event.","December 2, 2018","True to Size"

I'm 5'4"" and the slit in the skirt came to just above my knee. The mesh slit in the chest was low as if it was a low cut blouse but without showing cleavage.

The dress was beautiful and such an amazing quality! I will say that looking at the dress in the picture online, it appears to be a flowy-type dress, when in actuality it's form fitting with a cascading cape-style fabric over it. The slit in the tight fitting portion of the dress is very high, so if you're not a fan of high slits, then this dress is not for you. The dress is also very, very low-cut. I'm self-conscious about low-cut things and was very uncomfortable all night long.

The bodice was snug, which was a surprise since I don't have a large chest. You can wear it without a bra (score!). The slit in the leg was SUPER high. Combine that with a short slip underneath, you are pretty exposed if you're not careful when you're sitting down. Thankfully I was at a dinner table and had a napkin to cover it for the majority of the time.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works for cup A-C sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra or no bra since there is an open back. At 5’4”, the length hit floor length on me. The color of the dress is beautiful in person and the hidden split make it unique.

My first time ever wearing this style of dress and I will definitely wear it more often. It was flattering and forgiving. I am a 38 G -40 H and I pulled this off with NO Bra. I had to be aware of the ""girls"" but it was good fit. I wore a smoothing undergarment (no waist trainer) and 3 inch heels. It dragged a little but it wasn't annoying. The split is pronounced if its windy or a fan is blowing but just walking, your legs aren't exposed. I wouldn't wear this dress in church without a jacket because its low cut but at a reception it's a head turner.

I typically wear somewhere between a 4 and a 6. The top of the six was to big and the 4 was a bit snug, so I went for the 4. Even though it was snug, it pulled in all the right places, I didn't even need to wear Spanx.

I feel like you could dress this up or down depending on the type and color of jewelry because it's very simple and elegant. My only complaint is that I had to keep *extremely* good posture all night to keep the straps up. My torso may be shorter than these straps were intended for. Without pulling my shoulder blades back, my cleavage was insane. I'm also a DD cup size though, and it still fit on my chest, so overall it was a win!

I rented the exact same one in gold from RTR for prom three years ago, and I loved it so much that I got it in this GORGEOUS blue color for my sorority's formal. It hugged me in all of the right places and still left enough room for my Spanx. The dress is lined, but I am a 32DD, so I had to wear a backless bra, which worked well. I wound up wearing the 6R, but I might have been able to do the 4R... My backup was an 8R because I was worried about room for the girls, but the dress was definitely good for my bust. It really flattered my figure and minimized the girls while giving me an awesome hourglass figure. For shoes, I wore 4-inch heels, and the dress didn't drag. I did take them off to dance, and the dress did drag on the floor a little bit (I'm 5'6) but not too badly. Obviously, I love this dress since I've rented it twice, haha.

I did opt to wear spanx because I was really bloated he night of the event and I wanted a smoother look, but with the right underwear, spanx aren’t necessary. The 4R and 6R fit, but I needed to wear the neck on the second more loose set of clasps with the 4 so it left the fits set of claps exposed (poor design flaw). Due to the exposed claps with the 4 I opted for the size 6. We have another event in a couple months and my husband has asked me if I’ll wear this gown again!","April 5, 2019","True to Size"

This style did not come in long length, but I gave it a try with the knowledge that I'd have to adjust my shoe choice accordingly. What I didn't realize is that the long length gowns aren't just longer in the hem. The overall proportion of this dress was shorter: the neckline, waist, and hip all hit me at the wrong spot. The fabric has no stretch, which might have helped a little. Although I measure a 4 in this designer, I chose to wear the 6 because sizing up gave me almost an extra inch in length overall. My regular size 4 was the correct width at bust, waist, and hip BUT it was so short in the neck that it was choking me. On the plus side, it's a lovely vivid color and photographs well. I'm glad I tried it but would not rent this one again.","January 26, 2019","Formal Affair"

You can not really wear a bra however the cut on the top allows you to do so with enough material where you can not notice. I ordered 8p and 10p and went with the 10p because of my bust size.

The neck was pretty, I wore a simple gold choker, but you could get away without wearing a necklace. The top part was a little low, but if you're smaller it'll fit just fine. I didn't wear a bra because of the back, but I did wear those adhesive breast lifts (Fashion first aid The perk up) which not sure if I needed because the waist was fairly snug (but comfortable), but it made me more comfortable knowing something was kind of sort of holding me up. The dress was a little long, but with heels it was perfect. The zipper was a little sticky, but it seemed to loosen slightly with each time I tried it on. It would be nice if they could wax the zippers before sending. I've seen this complaint before with other dresses as well.

This dress was perfect because the waist was cut higher than normal, so it was just all flowy fabric around my belly which was already starting to expand. (I couldn't bear the thought of wearing anything tight around my waist.) The color is a gorgeous soft blush pink and the skirt flowed really nicely. It was especially good for twirling on the dance floor. Before getting pregnant I had a 28"" underbust and the 2R size fit just right. By the end of the night, after some dancing (and I presume some swelling from the dancing), it started to feel slightly tight around my ribcage but not super uncomfortable. I wore this dress with the Betsey Johnson ""Lucy"" embellished flats in Blush and the color paired beautifully. I will say though that with the flats, the bottom of the dress was already slightly grazing the floor, so I would not recommend wearing flats with this dress for anyone under 5'8"".

Running small with some stretch, I recommend sizing up for your primary size. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and straight at the hips. It works best for A-C cups. You are not able to wear a strapless bra with this gown so you should wear a strapless bra since it has a halter neckline. At 5'5, the length hit floor length on me.

It runs pretty true-to-size, but the arms are tight. I'm between a 4 and a 6 and for this reason (the arm fit) I chose the 6. But fair warning, the 6 has a small snag on the front lace that I noticed right away. Dress it up with a chunky necklace and heels. The warm satin lining of the dress makes it a nice choice for winter weddings, too.","October 21, 2019","Wedding"

Careful to check the lace, mine was ripped in the back when I got it but you could barely tell so I still wore it.","May 1, 2019","Wedding"

To fit the theme, several of us donned boots with our dresses. So my goal was to find a dress to go with my legit boots that have teal horses in the leather. This dress did the trick. The color wasn't an exact match, this is a little mintier in color than teal, but it was pretty and very comfy. In fact, the most comfortable rental so far. The fabric is stretchy and the cut offers a lot of coverage, so you can shake your booty without risking indecent exposure. It was what I needed for this occasion - and did all the things that RTR does (easy, on time, clean, etc.) - so I gave it 5 stars, but this has been my least favorite rental because it's a fairly generic dress. My other rentals have definitely been standout and drew a ton of compliments.","October 7, 2018","Wedding"

The lining is thicker which helps hold you in. I did feel that because the bottom flairs out so low on the waist, that it made me look 10 pounds heavier. I didn't think it was a super flattering on my frame. However, the color and pattern were great, and I did get a lot of compliments.

I would have preferred it to be 2 inches shorter; it hit me right at the knee, but most dresses go below my knee so I counted it as a win. The color was beautiful.

I was a little concerned of the shorter length and the short torso of the dress (felt like it gave me a stockier look), but once I put on some heels, it helped to elongate the dress. Also, the arms are tight (I have muscular arms), so the 10 was the best fit. But the pros outweighed the two cons. Gorgeous color, lace was elegant, versatile, heavier fabric was great for a cool May evening and I felt amazing in it!

The only negatives were in the wear the dress is starting to show -- on the size 12 I wore, there's a hole in the lace right at mid-bust, and in some other places (upper right shoulder) it's starting to unravel.

The arms were a little tight but I was comfortable throughout the night. It's also a little tight around the stomach area so if you're self conscious about that, I would look at other options.

This does run true to size but I would size up if you are curvier in the hips. You will need a strapless bra or NuBra due to the shoulders and the fabric does not have any stretch so keep that in mind when choosing your backup! At 5'6, this was 3 inches off the ground while wearing flats. This would work best for A to C cups since there isn't any room in the bust.

In a perfect world I would have worn a 2r instead of 0p but that was all that was available. So I lived off of broiled chicken, steamed broccoli, and green smoothies for 5 days and managed to wear the zero fine. I did have to wear flats to keep from looking goofy with the length but that was actually a blessing. So much more comfy! I received compliments all night and was stopped and asked for photos!!!","March 16, 2016","Formal Affair"

I thought it was stunning but at 5'6"" the dress was at the floor when I was barefoot. I was better off with a different dress in a 2L. However, I would wear this dress if I can find amazing flat shoes to pair the dress with!","March 2, 2016","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NK24","Cristina","Sexy but Classy","The fabric was great for the winter wedding I attended (warm and flexible). It was a little short for my height (5'6""), and the upper waist area/bust was a little loose. Also, I wouldn't consider myself to have curvy hips (alas), but the dress was a little tight in the hip area, so if you're particularly curvy, you might want to size up. Neither the 4L nor 6R were options for me when I rented, so I would have been curious to see if a different size solved some of my ""fit"" issues. Overall, the silhouette is very flattering. This was also my first RTR experience, and it was really great - very efficient!","February 5, 2016","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NK24","Rachel","I received compliments all night!","Fabric is thick but stretches with curves. I'd suggest going with the long if you have huger heels or long legs to avoid your toes showing under bottom of dress","December 1, 2015","Wedding"

The fit was great but I should have gone with a 6 Long. The fabric was a bit thick which made it a little hot but is also did not show sweat. I got a lot of compliments!","October 26, 2015","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NK24","Lauren","My cousin's formal wedding was full of smiles, laughter, and dancing!","The dress I had rented was damaged by the previous renter, so the RTR stylists chose this dress as a replacement. I was heartbroken by the change and I never would have picked this dress myself, but in the end I am SO GLAD for the way things worked out. This dress was perfect. Everyone who saw it loved it. The color is stunning, it's comfortable, and the shape is incredibly flattering. Notes: (1) The fabric is thick and heavy. This was GREAT for my event but could mean discomfort for yours. (2) It can take some time to get used to walking, especially up/down stairs, due to the mermaid shape. (3) Either bring someone to the ladies' room with you to help you zip down/zip up, or hike it up by yourself and spend some time realigning the lining and dress afterward. Cons: (1) The arm holes are large! I had to be careful of how I stood because at times my nude bra showed. (2) Without the right undergarments there WILL be bunching and visible lines, so plan ahead. Pros: (1) The color is stunning! (2) It's so incredibly comfortable! I could sit, stand, walk (after some practice - I'm not used to mermaid cuts) and most importantly - DANCE all night long. (3) The thick fabric is perfect for cooler weather. I was the only one in my group who didn't need a shawl or jacket. (4) The shape is incredibly flattering. It will make you into an hourglass regardless of your natural shape. (5) It's versatile. I added some edge with a funky necklace, but it would be so easy to make it much more elegant if your event calls for that. I loved this dress, and most of all I loved RTR's attention to detail and commitment to helping me look GREAT!","October 15, 2015","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NK24","Rachel","Absolutely LOVED this dress!!!","Fit like a glove on my pear shaped body. I'm typically a size 4, so I found the dress to be true to size. It was super comfortable and easy to dance in! The material was perfect for a chilly, rainy October evening. I was slightly worried about the train initially, but I hardly noticed it all night. This dress definitely makes a statement. Extremely classy. Made me feel confident, sexy and beautiful. I got SO many compliments throughout the night. Cannot say enough great things about this dress!","October 12, 2015","Wedding"

The material of the dress was a little heavy, that being said when worn during the winter months, it was perfect. The dress fit true to size, and was perfect for a curvy body type! I got it in a ""long"" because I'm 6 feet tall so I wanted to make sure it was long enough with my heels, and it was perfect!","October 1, 2015","True to Size"

I would recommend this dress for anyone 5'2"" and up who is good with high heels. The bust was a bit tight for me and flattened my chest slightly. I wasn't able to wear a bra, but it worked fine. The material is very heavy and not very breatheable, but the weight helped the dress hang nicely.","May 10, 2015","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NK24","Kaci","An amazing fit, comfortable, and classy!","I wore this to my sorority's formal (that explains the kite pictures). The fit was perfect. I have a big butt and boobs, so I get nervous about form-fitting dresses because they're usually too tight in those places and too loose in the stomach. The fit of this dress is perfect for anyone with an hourglass shape, as the material is the perfect amount of stretchy and structured. I got so many compliments on how this dress looked on me and my boyfriend loved it! The only complaints I have about this dress is that I couldn't wear a bra with it because it was tight but the material was thick enough that no one could really tell, and the dress was very plain. At first I wasn't too excited about it because of the lack of details, but after I added a necklace and did my hair I was more satisfied.","April 24, 2015","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NK24","Anne","A Stunningly Simple and Sexy Dress","This dress is simple, classic, and sexy. It's perfect for a formal event that's not too flashy, but yet the dress makes a statement because of its interesting lines and figure flattering silhouette. I ordered a 2R as a backup size and opted to wear this instead of the 4R. The material is heavy and everything was held in place, and because I'm on the shorter side, the 2R hit right at the floor and was perfect. I highly recommend this dress.","February 3, 2015","True to Size"

I can be between a 2 and a 4, I stuck with the 4 because it is a snug dress, so if you're debating, go the size larger.

I love the back cutout and the lace details were beautiful. Unfortunately, I am a shorter girl - 5'3'', and most dresses are made for much taller women. The dress hit a little long for my taste and just made my body look shorter, as well as losing its ""form-fitting"" style and just kinda swayed on the second half of my body haha.

Fair warning - the black middle band has no give (it's not elastic) so I had to wear the small so I could breathe.

This dress is very comfortable! Please note the cut outs in the sides; they are adorable, but really impact the fit of the dress! I was unable to wear a strapless bra with this because you could see the bottom of the bra thru the top of the cutout. So I just went braless! And for me (and my 36DDs) that was a first!

It wasn't as great as other dresses I've rented from RTR, but I will say its also the least expensive dress I've rented, so, you get what you pay for. The black waistband has ZERO stretch, so I would size yourself to that to prevent discomfort. It did mean it was a bit big on top (my measurements are 34A-25"" waist-37"" hip, and I went with Small). Up top there was definitely extra room/some slight gaping to the fabric, but a padded strapless bra probably would have solved that issue (I don't like padded bras, so I just went with pasties). The extra room on top also meant the cutouts were in no way cutting in to your mid section, which was really great and flattering, especially after eating wedding cake! Overall a really sweet dress, great color, nice hi-lo hem (which was perfect since this was an outdoor wedding that turned out to be VERY muddy!).","June 26, 2017","True to Size"

Like other reviews say, it runs small around the rib cage. I normally wear a 0 and ended up wearing my backup size 2. The 0 fit better in the chest, but I wanted to be comfortable for eating and dancing and the 0 made it a little hard to breathe. Because I went with the 2, the straps were a little loose and sometimes slipped off while dancing. Some fashion tape would have fixed the issue. The length was perfect for me - I'm 4'11"" and it hit right above the knees. My only complaint is that the bottom looked a little raggedy. It was starting to fray and pill.

It was hard to tell from some of the photos, but I felt like it covered my girls well and gave them some lift but didn't cross any sort of ""tacky"" line. I did not have to wear a bra, which was great. I wore it to my husband's Christmas party (a young startup), and I felt like it was completely appropriate. If you have a larger chest or are attending a very conservative event, this may not be the right dress. I was a big fan, though, and got lots of compliments.

The straps were a little loose, but I suspect how loose the straps are really depend on whether you have a chest to fill it out-- it's definitely not a dress for A or B bra sizes. I did use fashion tape to make sure everything stayed in place, and it was all good for the whole night-- got a lot of compliments and felt super confident in it :) (very low cut, which made me a little self-conscious, but it looked good-- definitely won't hide a bra, though).

I'm just under 100lbs so finding dresses that fit right is often difficult. At 5'2 this dress hit about mid thigh for me, but with the flirty flare of the dress it felt a little shorter than that (wore Nike pros underneath for my own comfort). Beautiful deep teal color.

I've rented E&J before (with cutouts) and I did feel like the cutouts were in unflattering places as compared to other dresses.

I'm originally a 4 and thank goodness I got a size up to a 6. I think I would even had been more comfortable in a 8.

It's a gorgeous color and the cutouts are trendy but not too revealing. The size 2 and 4 were pretty close but I felt the 4 was a little too long. The only issue I had was that the hemline folded over in one spot and hung down a bit lower so I had to keep trying to fold it back a few times. (Maybe ironing it would have helped it stay.)","June 17, 2017","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ68","Aimee","So thankful we found this dress on RTR!!","We rented this dress for my daughter's 8th grade dance. We had been to every mall, store and online site until it dawned on me to go to RTR. We got this dress for a fraction of the cost if we had bought one and it arrived on time (actually a day early) which was great so she could try it on and with all the accessories and shoes before the big night. The color is stunning! She got so many compliments on it. I was concerned about the side cut outs but they were very tasteful and not too flashy at all. Even her father approved!! ;) We had to go out of town the next day, so I just brought the package with me and found the nearest UPS, walked in and the guy immediately took it from me and I was on my way!! The process couldn't have been easier or more seamless!! I will never forget this option ever again in the future when looking for the perfect dress for future events. One side note - the dress runs extremely small! My daughter normally wears and size 2 and the size 4 was snug, but she got away with it. She probably could have worn a size 6. Regardless we were VERY satisfied with our selection and the whole process in general. Thank you RTR!!!! -A Relieved and Extremely Satisfied Mother","June 8, 2017","Small"

The only down side was when I was sitting down it was a little snug in the waist, specifically where the cut out part were located. So I was slightly uncomfortable during those times.

It's a perfect stretch and so forgiving from the waistline to hips. It contoured my bum without looking too 'kardashian'. The length is modest for the leg conscious but the lace makes it fun and flirty. The top is quite lower than expected and finding a bra that doesn't show is tough. I opted for a very thin black lace bra so if it showed it looked like part of the dress. Same goes for the back. The opening is just low enough to show minimal bra band so I would suggest nubra or a low back. Over all I'm in love with this perfect dress. Also to note: the customer service at rtr is seriously unbeatable.","September 17, 2017","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RZ76","Alison","Art Show","This dress is awesome! It's sexy, but the long sleeves and high neck make it appropriate for a more conservative occasion. The fabric has a nice weight to it, so it works well for fall and winter events. The only downside of this dress is that I couldn't raise my arms higher than my shoulders because the lace sleeves confined my movements. For this reason, I'd say not to rent it for a wedding or any other event where you'll be dancing.","September 15, 2017","True to Size"

The material has a little give, which is good, because it JUST fit. I am a size 12, so that's why I put ""true to size"", but if you've had a big weekend of partying and eating I would recommend sizing up just for a little more room. The backup size 10 did not fit me. Comfortable to wear dancing all night! Would rent this LBD again!","August 3, 2015","Wedding"

It was nicely tight though because it kind of pushed everything in. The big thing was that I needed to be able to sit since I was at a work awards ceremony.

The asymmetrical neckline & hem make it stand out from your typical LBD. The crepe fabric has enough give that I didn't feel corseted, and the whole look just worked well.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RY18","K","Sophisticated LBD (killer fit for pear shaped women)","This is a *great* dress for pear shaped women. The design of the arms creates the illusion of a balanced top & bottom. The asymmetrical, sharp V-neckline is dramatic & sexy without being too revealing (excellent for professional as well as personal events). I wore a size 8 (didn't get another size in this dress, so can't compare the fit differences between sizes), and was lucky that the dress' waistline hit at my own, the curves over the hips and butt hit at the right places. [Since women's dress sizes vary, I'll give some additional measurements to help others decide what size to order: 14-1/2"" collarbone to waist, 19"" collarbone to top of hip, 26"" collarbone to widest part of thigh, 28"" around waist, 35"" around widest part of belly, 36-1/2"" around at hips, 39-1/2"" around both legs at widest part of thigh.] The dress was fitted, but not sausage-like. The material was heavy enough that there could be room in the stomach (yay! comfortable sitting down) without there looking like there was extra room across the stomach. The angled hemline has a slight slimming effect on the legs, cutting across the knees, but mainly it's an interesting detail (like the neckline) which saves the dress from being dowdy. You can't see it in any of the pictures, but at the high side of the hemline, there is an additional 2"" slit. It's helpful to be tall because of the length of the dress. Heels make a dramatic difference. If you're looking for a similar fit, but shorter hemline, search this site for one of the Black Halo Jackie O dresses (RTR should always have one in their inventory because of its killer fit). As others have mentioned, you really don't notice the see-through panel in the dress in normal or low lighting.","October 25, 2014","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RY18","Diana","Very user friendly website, great price, great convenience. Will definitely do this again!","I was undecided to get the 8 and 10 or the 10 and 12. The 10 was the best fit overall with just a little big of looseness around the waist and the shoulders (one shoulder slipped off on occasion). The sheer panel is not noticeable at all, but you do need to think about what undergarments you want to wear to avoid peekage through the panel. Got lots of compliments. Very classy, sleek look. The fit was tight through the abdomen, so I didn't need spanx, but it was very comfortable. The full body picture makes it look like it wasn't form fitting, but that's just the shadows from photography, it's very form fitting, but not in a bad way. The close up of the upper body shows how it lays on your body. The asymmetrical cut is very flattering. There is some gappage in the under arm area, where if you move your arm a certain way you can see the side of your bra, but again, just wear black and it's just a minor flash from time to time, no one noticed. The return was so easy, I couldn't believe it. Just slip both dresses in the bag and drop off at a UPS store or drop box.","May 2, 2013","True to Size"

I normally wear a 10 or 12 depending on the designer and tend to have thicker thighs so I went with the 12 and it's a good thing I did. The skirt of the dress was form fitting but definitely not too tight - I could move easily. Because I went with the 12, the midsection was a little looser than needed but since the dress was solid black, it wasn't obvious. I did wear Spanx with it.

I was not comfortable with the sheer section on the torso so I wore black shape wear so that it wasn't visible. Loved that I could wear a normal bra and that there was more coverage than most dressed up top. HIGHLY recommend.

I planned to get my usual medium and a large as the backup size but after reading that it ran large, I went with a small as the backup. I'm glad I did because even with a little bump, it fit better. The bodice wasn't that much smaller than the medium but the shoulders and length were better. I did have to pin the front to my bra because it wouldn't stay closed.

I am 5'8"" and preferred the look of the dress touching the floor so I wore flats, which was fine by me, as I was also going for comfort! Only con: although I generally have pretty wide shoulders, the shoulder kept slipping down. I almost expected there to be snaps inside for holding bra straps but there weren't.

I had to be super careful not to snag it on jewelry or other items and therefore found it uncomfortable. I also picked this style because it seemed elegant but modest, and was surprised at how low cut it was. It did not fully cover my bra but i did not want to make it dowdy by wearing a cami, especially given that it hit below the knee. It required constant adjustment and tweaks to avoid flashing. All in all, an uncomfortable dress.","February 26, 2018","Large"

I got a few compliments, especially on the cutouts. There were two things I noticed about it that made it less than a 10/10 for me. 1) I didn't really notice the way the skirt had a second 'tier', it's not so obvious in the photos but I typically prefer skirts that are either straight or flare from the waist, not the mid-thigh. 2) Because of my curvier figure and the way the cutouts/bodice are built, I think the waist hit a little higher on me than intended to. There was some gaping in the front because of that--not that noticeable though. Overall, I think this dress would work best for someone with a pretty straight figure, but anyone could rock it if they wanted to!","May 10, 2018","True to Size"

I really liked the color of the dress, the length, and the lace. I also liked the high neck - I wore a strapless bra and had no issues. It was comfortable and overall I really did like the dress. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the weird stomach seems. Instead of a cinched waist where the dress flares out, it's like a double cinch where the band goes right across your stomach. It isn't super noticeable, but it's very odd.

Running true to size , I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up especially for bigger bust. This style is fitted all around and gives you a nice classy summer look for any occasion. It works best for cup sizes A-C and can be worn with a strapless bra . At 5’2”, the length stops me at knee length and with a nude color pair of heels this will complete your outfit!

The photo does not do it justice- it is a lovely dark green color with lovely accents. The best part is that the straps in the back are adjustable so you can wear it as low or high as you are comfortable. Because the fit was so perfect, I personally did not need a bra (just some adjusting once it was zipped) but you could easily wear it with a strapless if you wanted that option. Also the length was great, it hit me right at mid-knee and I'm 5'7"". I would not hesitate to rent this dress again.","December 10, 2017","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CLO36","Christine","Very fitted dress. Not for women who carry their weight in the stomach area. Runs slightly small.","I liked this dress, but didn't love it. It is an extremely fitted dress that shows every bump. I don't carry my weight in my stomach, but this dress made it look like I did. I needed to wear spanx and to hold in my stomach throughout the evening to carry off this dress. Other neoprene dresses that I have rented at RTR didn't have that issue. Also, the sleeves are quite long. In terms of fit, I would say it runs fairly small. I am a size 10 in RTR dresses (5'8"", 155 lbs, 36C) and this dress in size Large was quite fitted on me. Also, because there is only a very short zipper in the back, it takes some wrangling to get into that dress. The dress is unlined and made out of a sturdy neoprene material. The design is via laser-cut cutouts. I wore the dress with a regular nude bra rather than a strapless bra. As long as the tone of the bra matches my skin tone, I found that one couldn't tell what was my bra and what was my skin.","August 13, 2018","Small"

I typically wear smalls and size 4 but the small in this case looked bad as it bunched up around the stomach and made me look like I had rolls! The XS actually fit better because it hugged me everywhere. I wore a deep cut strapless bra and you could still see a bit of my black bra but it worked with the dress. I went bare-legged to the restaurant and wore a long coat and felt fine!

She is always cold, and since we were going out in Seattle in March I wanted to make sure she would be warm enough. This dress did the trick! The fabric is very thick, and as some have mentioned it feels like scuba material. That said, it is a chore to get on and off. We were laughing pretty hard the first time I had to help pull it off of her. And she did have to wear shape wear underneath, because on her it was quite tight. She probably could have done and XL, but that wasn't an option. The one strange thing about the dress was how large the arms were. Now I assume it's this way so your arms don't bulge out of the laser cut, but it was a little strange. They were also VERY long. All in all a cute dress. Probably not for short people though, or for those afraid of showing off their curves.","April 29, 2016","Date"

I ended up being able to wear a low cut bra with straps without it showing. Definitely put this on before you do your hair/makeup as it doesn't zip all the way down.

It's unique and easy to wear. The thick neoprene-like material is warm even with the cutouts. Although it's definitely sexy, it's not overtly so which was nice for when we were with colleagues but it was also easily dressed up once we hit the bar later. I typically wear a medium but wore the large (back up size) as the medium was really hard to get into (zipper does not go the whole dress and I was worried about my hair). When I tried both sizes on though, they were nearly identical (the only difference was that cutouts on the large displayed more chest). I would definitely rent this dress again!","March 8, 2016","Small"

This dress fit like a glove, I wore a bra for my own comfort, but most women probably wouldn't need one. I only gave it 4 stars because since this dress is basically a scuba suit, it gets HOT! It was a cold night (30 degrees and windy) so it was great outside but once I was inside any type of dancing made me feel like I was in heating up. Also the cutouts tend to snag. The dress came on time and in great condition. This is my 3rd or 4th experience with RTR and as usual it was great.","February 29, 2016","True to Size"

The only thing that was annoying was the zipper in the back- it only goes to mid-shoulder blade length, so you have to pull the dress over your head; it was hard to get on and off. It got a little warm at times when dancing, but was great for the rest of the dinner! No shawl or cardigan needed. I thought this would be short on me, but it was knee-length.

The dress is very classic and somewhat conservative in the front, but the back makes it extra fun and sexy. But it's not the type of dress you need to fiddle with, it stays in place. Silver-type heels look best with this to match the waistband. I'm tall and the long did not hit the ground.","October 10, 2019","Formal Affair"

I like a dress that is fitted through the waist and this did just the trick. The only thing I would caution is that there is a lot of fabric, so if you have a larger behind there is a tendency to accentuate this. As others mentioned the zipper is stubborn and I found myself using a bar of soap to make the zipper slick as others recommended (great trick!!). If you are pear shaped and on the fence about a size I'd recommend ordering based on your bust and waist measurements, as I would have preferred it to be slightly more fitted on top.","June 4, 2019","True to Size"

I don't usually buy clothes online because I need to try it on to see if it fits all in the right places, so I was nervous whether or not this dress would like good. Lo and behold, it fit like a glove! The material was really nice, the back was to DIE FOR, and the ladies were nice and covered. The zipper was a little tough to zip up (I'm a little squishy), but once it was zipped all the way it was really snug. There was a little space near the armpits but not enough to where you can see the ladies or anything. Other than that, it was a really beautiful dress! I fell in love with it when I was browsing the site, and I fell even more in love when I put it on. I felt so elegant and regal and got so many compliments on it! My date liked it too ;) The description is correct in that the zipper falls around your waist, so if you have fuller hips (like me), that won't be a problem with this dress. I stuffed the little padding things from one of my sports bras into my dress to cover the ladies, so nope I did not wear a bra and it was okay!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BDT6","Melbeck","","If you like to dance, and you have hips or a butt, DO NOT RENT THIS DRESS! I rented this for a wedding out of town and did not have time to return it for a new dress to wear. My solution? Duct tape. I had to duct tape myself to squeeze into a pencil shape in order for it not to bunch weird. The lining is cut weird, so it runs way small on the bottom but fine on top. Also, here is the kicker... half way through the wedding the slit in the back of the dress ripped all the way up the back that my butt cheeks hung out! I had to safety pin the dress closed for the rest of the evening. I've rented from RTR three other times and have never had an issue until now. Needless to say, the dress was a hot mess!","June 4, 2019","Wedding"

Great dress if you've got a flat butt! Fit my chest and waist almost perfectly, though. I'm 5'0"" and 145 lbs. I carry most of my weight in my thighs, so this just didn't work out for me.","October 24, 2019","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BDT6","Sonia","So many compliments!!","I would definitely size up. I'm usually a small but in that size, the dress wouldn't make it over my thighs. There's really no give in the dress, it's not stretchy. I was able to wear it without a bra with no issues, the top of the dress had enough support. It was slightly snug on the bottom for me, but if I'd gone larger, the top would've been huge. I did get so many compliments on it though, and the color and lace pattern were lovely! I would still rent it again.","October 6, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BDT6","RTR Customer","Great wedding!","The dress is really pretty. However, if you are someone with curves, the dress may be a little uncomfortable. It took me a lot of fashion tape to make sure the the top laid flat and stayed put. You won’t be able to wear a bra with this dress, so you either have to go braless or wear an adhesive bra. The inner lining was also very tight. Overall the dress was really pretty, but it was a little uncomfortable to wear, and took some effort to make sure everything stayed in place.","September 8, 2019","Small"

So after picking 4 ""favorite"" dresses 2 days before my event I received this one and a Jill Stuart dress. This dress fit the best. The fabric is on the thicker side, but has some stretch so compensates for any ""problem areas"". I liked the color, a true navy, and the white accents which I think are unique. I added a navy and rhinestone necklace and earrings to dress it up a bit for the wedding I attended. The nude wedge heels I have did not look right so I wore navy suede booties. I felt very comfortable all evening and did a fair amount of dancing. Overall, I would say this was a good experience even though I did not get the dress I originally requested. The event was for my husband's co-worker's daughter so I did not know anyone at the event. If I were to have a more personal event I am not sure I could be satisfied not knowing what dress was being shipped 24 hours in advance.

The cut and fit of the dress was nice, didn't have any problems with it riding up, and it was easier to move around in than you'd expect.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back-up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. Curvier women should consider sizing up for full hips. It works best for A - C cups sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a nubra or no bra because of the open back. At 5'4, the length hit tea length on me. Painterly bouquets and flouncy ruffles bring feminine romance to this flowy V-neck dress. Pair with cute sandals and a fun bracelet to complete your outfit!","July 25, 2018","True to Size"

The background is really light grey (not white) and a little see-through, so skin color undies are recommended. There are two slits on the front, but are tasteful.

However, the dress itself is poorly designed. The bodice of the 4 was way too large, and the 2 was too small in the ribs. In addition, the zipper is not strong enough to match the weight of the fabric, and so it was nearly impossible to close either size dress. Clearly someone else had struggled to fit into the 4, as the fabric was ripped along the ribs by the zipper.","October 24, 2019","Wedding"

All you need is a pair of big dangly earrings and a pair of great pumps and you're set! Best part was the sexy crisscross straps in the back! All in all, LOVED this rental!","September 17, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL36","RTR Customer","This dress made me feel like a million bucks!","This dress was true to size and fit me like a glove. Having said that, it had ZERO stretch, which is important to keep in mind for the waist area. The size 4 juuussstt cut it for me with a little bit of room up top but wasn't so gappy that I needed to tape anything down. You could use nipple stickers or a nubra but the fabric is also thick enough that those could be optional. If in between sizes, go up one size - not down - but keep the chest area in mind if you're pear-shaped. I loved the color, the jeweled waist detail, and how the fun, criss-crossed back balanced out the more conservative front.","September 16, 2019","True to Size"

Luckily got help with getting straps over my head and with the zipper, because if your hair is done up for a wedding, it’s a tight squeeze getting into the dress. Dress is comfortable for dancing/ sitting/ standing, only cons are: my dress had a long tag still attached and I didn’t wanna cut it off but when you try it on it sometimes pops out and looks off, & the front of the dress didn’t sit perfectly flat for me, had to keep pulling the straps away from my neck to have it sit right.","July 30, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL36","RTR Customer","Felt elegant and sexy","I wore the size 10. The 8 was too tight in the bust because I'm a 36D. I wore it to my husband's Christmas party and I felt regal. I don't get dressed up often but when I do, I love dresses like this. The back is the show stopper. I added it for show in the pictures. The pockets are a plus and I didn't even have to wear a bra because the dress pretty much held the girls in place...bonus. Only thing I didn't like was you had to keep straightening out the neckline because it will bunch up. I think that might be due to the looseness of the straps in the back. That is the only con. The color is just gorgeous. I paired it with silver shoes. For reference, since I can't save my information for some reason, I'm 5'2, 36D, 151 lbs.

The back was so pretty I wish I would have taken a picture. The best part? Pockets!!!!!!!! I didn't have to carry a purse and worry about where I set it down. My hubby was pretty excited that for once he didn't have to walk around with lipgloss in his pockets.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL36","RTR Customer","Beautiful dress and great first expereince!","This was my first RTR experience. Rented for 14 year old daughter freshman homecoming. It was age appropriate. Classy and fitted beautifully at a size 2. Beautiful navy blue fabric, has a nice sheen to it. Paired with super fun shoes that were comfortable all night and had personality. Wore hair up to show off back. Only issue is that the hem on the front right sagged. Tried to attach with fabric tape but didn't hold. It wasn't terribly noticeable though. Initially selected the Tracy Reese Charmed By You Dress, and back upsize was not available. Chose this as the second option when offered for no additional cost. The Tracy Reese dress was a little short and my daughter didn't like the fabric--compared it to curtains...and she didn't like how the shoulders had to be worn a bit off the shoulders.

But, truly I needed the 10...this probably fits perfectly if you have a smaller waist and tummy, my trouble areas. It's definitely fit and flare. The color and fabric are gorgeous, and it doesn't show when a little tight. The zipper was also SO HARD to zip up even when putting on the hanger, but on it took two of us for sure! It was large in the bust, but I found a strapless/backless bra at Soma that worked well and helped me fill it out enough to look great for one night!","October 9, 2018","Small"

She paired with Slate & Willow silver crystal earrings (RTR), shoes and clutch were purchased on Zappos. She's 124#, 5'2"", and a 32C. She wore her hair up so you could see the beautiful back to the dress. However, you will have to wear a special bra (she bought her's at Walmart) since the back is open. The beading was good on this dress but we'd accidentally ordered two of these and the beading on the other dress was in serious need of repair! Also, the bottom layer was longer for some reason than the outer layer of the dress and showed underneath. Fortunately, I had hem tape I purchased for another daughter, problem solved!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ZP6","Sarah","Beautiful fabric and pockets made this a stand-out dress!","The fit was great for my hourglass shape - small in the waist with plenty of room in the hips. I ordered a size up from my usual size to make sure it was comfortable. I'd say the fit is somewhere between small and true-to-size. The straps - as many have mentioned - were really long, but a couple of safety pins on each side kept them where they belong. I had to use big safety pins due to how thick the material is, but was able to pin them inside the dress so they weren't visible. The material is very thick but does have a little bit of give so it fits and flatters really well. The pockets were a great added bonus! I rented this for my company holiday party, where all the employees get to perform at a music venue. I spent the evening running on and off stage, playing instruments, etc, and the dress was so comfortable I didn't have to spend any time adjusting it. I was able to keep the set list in the pocket so I had a copy all night.

Overall flattering fit, perfect length, and photographs well. The material has a cool pattern and very rich color that I was complimented on all night. I wore this to a friend's Sweet 16, so I danced all night. This dress was easy to move in and wasn't restricting at all (didn't ride up/down, squeeze, or cinch weird). The one problem I had was that the straps were too long (probably because I have a small chest)- but it was an easy fix with a couple of safety pins. Would definitely recommend this dress.","January 1, 2016","True to Size"

The fabric of the dress even matched the background of the photo booth! I wore it with a tulle petticoat underneath for extra poof, and a pair of long white gloves. There are a couple of little issues with the dress: 1) the straps are too long so I had to safety pin them -- for reference, I am 5'5"" with an average length torso; 2) the dress runs large. I wore the 6 (backup was a 8), but would be better off in a 4.","December 13, 2015","Party"

Second, the dress is completely see-through - I was able to make it work with nude undergarments but be warned! Third, wrinkled extremely easily. Finally, the dress showed water spots - any time I washed my hands (or my bump hit the sink) and water splashed on the dress, it would leave spots after it was dried. Luckily there was enough excess fabric that it wasn't too noticeable, but still. Dress was a little too short in the back to be work appropriate with heels, so I wore flat sandals. One pro is that it was extremely comfortable!","July 15, 2019","Large"

It has tiny round buttons on the top/neck and I could not get those opened so I slipped that over my head. I wore 2 1/2"" heels and it was just the tiniest bit long (like 1/4 to 1/2""), so it worked out just fine.

The dress was very comfortable, but fits snug with stretch. You'll want to use shape-wear if you're concerned about smoothing your curves. The lace over the shoulders, which forms the keyhole back, is a bit tall so I pulled the back of the dress a little lower to accommodate for the extra fabric. There is absolutely no structure in the bra area, so I recommend a strapless bra or no bra, if you're up for it.

It works best for most cup sizes. You are able to wear a standard bra with this dress. At 5'0"", the length hit above the knee length on me.

It was perfect for a celebratory date night! Was out celebrating my boyfriend and he loved it, couldn't stop staring. I have a very small frame and usually wear a 00 or 0, and was nervous about trusting the other reviews and sizing up, but I'm so glad I did! I ordered a 0 and 2, and wore the 2. Fit like a glove, looked exactly as it should. Unfortunately, due in part to the cut of the dress but mostly the fabric (not a lot of stretch)--it's not the most practical. You definitely can't pull it up over your hips to use the restroom (have to take the dress off entirely to do so, and it's difficult to zip up efficiently yourself), and I even had some difficulty walking (have to take smaller steps), standing up/sitting down/getting in and out of cars, and taking stairs. Told my bf I just wouldn't drink any water at the restaurant and would just use the restroom when we got home, ha! So not the most practical, but it'll make you feel so sexy! :) Oh, and this is not a true red--more of a dark berry.","July 18, 2018","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL4","Olivia","Very fashionable but not at all functional","I chose this dress for a rehearsal dinner and ordered a second dress for a wedding I would be attending. First off, the color is gorgeous and the fabric is a nice thick material. Very flattering. Other reviewers who were smaller in the chest area mentioned that it didn't fit tight enough across the breast, which I found to be true for me, but I simply threw on a strapless padded bra and that resolved the issue there. Overall I have to say I really really wanted to love this dress. Aesthetically everything was perfect. The fit, however, was horrendous. I'm usually a 0 but ordered a 2 as a backup size based on the reviews. I probably could have actually ordered a 4 and it would have been a better fit (although I suspect the chest would have been much too roomy). The seam that runs around the top half of the dress made it difficult to zip once I had it on. I didn't think it would zip, actually. Once I got it closed finally I found I was really unable to move at all. You have to have good posture and so I found it difficult to breathe because if I didn't the dress was very unflattering on me in the midsection. The slit in the back didn't provide any additional range of motion for my legs so I couldn't move about easily. I also discovered that I would be unable to put my shoes on once wearing the dress because of my inability to bend in it. Furthermore, there was absolutely no give in the fabric so if I needed to use the restroom I would need to take the dress off completely (which is nearly impossible to do on my own). In the end I decided that I would be unable to wear this to my event due to it being so impractible and uncomfortable. It was a shame because it's a really beautiful dress and was very flattering.","June 24, 2018","Small"

The 2 fit, but I don't know that I would have been able to sit down in the dress had I actually worn it out. The dress is very tight through the hips, there is no give. I wore it to sing at an event, and it's not really made for moving around or dancing a lot.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LKL4","Laura","This dress worked great for the event I rented it for!","I liked this dress a lot. However it did have a lot of problems. FIRST: the dress was not the correct color when it arrived though it pictures as such. This dress is more of a purple red than bright red--my boyfriend couldn't wear his RED bowtie because my dress threw it off so much (which was really frustrating). SECOND: the dress is really constricting.. like couldn't walk up the stairs or take normal sized steps. I had to remove the ENTIRE DRESS when I used the restroom because the bottom is just so tight. Not to mention for women with thicker lower bodies your thighs will be stuck together all evening. It was very uncomfortable. THIRD: I received this dress and was shocked at how worn it was. The slit in the back was slightly torn and the clasp at the top was broken. The material was not fresh or new--dress showed a lot of wear from previous renters. Despite all of this, I still liked this dress! It was very flattering and I felt good in it. The bottom of the dress is very tight with little give but the stomach area was not as restricting? I ate an entire meal from start to finish and I didn't feel any tightness around my stomach area. I didn't have to wear a bra because the material was plenty thick and very supportive. ALSO: size up size up size up! If you decide to rent this dress you need to size up! I can typically wear a 2 or a 4. Those are always the two sizes I fluctuate between, however I went with what other women said and got a 4 and a 6 to be safe. I ended up wearing the 6!","April 25, 2018","Small"

Could barely breathe in the 0. I was afraid if I did anything other than stand, I would tear it. The 2 was perfect, and I was infinitely grateful that I had been able to order the back-up size for free. Pros: The dress looks exactly like the picture. Form fitting, sleek, hugs even a lack of figure. I got compliments all day on the design of the dress. Cons: Wow, does this run small. The 0 was extremely tight, and unless you are very, very, very slim, I suggest ordering up a size. Reference earlier this paragraph for my measurements and how I could barely breathe, yet alone zip up, the size 0. However, the 2 was perfect! Don't be afraid to order this dress. It runs hella small so just be ready to order up a size, and prepare to feel extremely good in what you're wearing.","April 21, 2018","Small"

Very similar to the feel and fit of the Elizabeth James dresses I've rented before. Cons: I usually wear a 4 and I decided to size up to a 6 and got the 8 as a back up. I could have worn the 6 but it was way too form fitting. I wore the 8 but if i had the 10 i probably would have worn that.

The jumpsuit was super comfortable with a pull-on styling, forgiveness at the waist, and pockets! I wore a strapless bra with it.

Running true to size with some stretch, I recommend wearing a size down for your primary size. This style is roomy throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works best for A-C cup, for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this apparel category so you should wear a strapless bra, nubra or no bra since cut of jumpsuit. I love how chic the frills are on the shoulder. Pair with type an open toe heel and bright earrings to complete your outfit!","April 17, 2018","True to Size"

I originally ordered a 6R (my normal size) and a 4R; unfortunately RTR couldn't fulfill the 6R and sent the 4R. I was pleasantly surprised that it fit. It was a bit tight under the arms and the sequins did rub a little, but nothing I couldn't deal with. I did wear a strapless bra, only because it made the girls look a bit perkier. The length was perfect with 3"" heels; I'm 5'4"". It was a nice material, not super heavy like most sequin dresses. The cut outs on the side were sexy but still classy.

The weight of the sequins makes the dress still hug your curves but then it was extremely comfortable! I’ve never been comfortable in a fancy dress before and it was great!

You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear a strapless bra since the cut of the dress will expose your bra straps. At 4’8”, the length hit knee length on me. The super soft material and comfortable while the neckline and buttons add a touch of sophistication creating an effortlessly chic look.

The color was so delicate and beautiful, as were the lace details. The dress was still comfy enough to dance all night in. It is a little on the heavy side but falls beautifully. I might have liked it if it was a bit shorter and hit closer to or above the knee but was still happy with this rental. Though the back details aren't pictured they're very cute and add a fun element to this dress.","July 1, 2019","Wedding"

The color, cut, and style are all fun and flirty without being too much for a formal event. Love the back. I usually wear a 4, but I'm glad I went with the 2 in this case. The waist was a smidge tight for me in the 2, but I think if I'd gone with the 4 the bust would have been too roomy. For a few hours going a size down was the right move in terms of getting the fit I wanted.","June 6, 2019","Small"

Like others have said, the top runs a little larger, while the waistband is quite tight. I felt more comfortable in the 4, but my chest simply couldn't fill it out. I chose to wear the 2 and have the waist just a tad tighter than what I'd consider comfortable. Would be absolutely perfect for someone with a tiny waist and larger chest.","June 23, 2018","Wedding"

I liked the color, the lacy flowers, the length was good, and I thought the front of the dress was flattering. What I didn't like was the back of the dress. The open back design on the back is not made for gals with short torsos or girls with a bit of extra cushion on their back....both of which I have. (I'm 5'3"" and 185lbs.) I just felt like the back was not flattering at all and that it didn't fit correctly on me. It made me uncomfortable and self-conscious for part of the night. Otherwise though, I thought it was cute and appropriate for the occasion. I just wish it didn't have that darn open back!","May 14, 2018","Small"

If you are happy with your back and or don't mind then get this dress. I am 5'5, 170 lbs, 36B, wide hips, a true pear shape. I ordered a 10, and 12. The dress is true to size, I wore the 10.

I got lots of compliments on the cut-out in back too!","The color was lovely, and the shape was very flattering. I had a lot of people who came back to find me during the wedding to tell me they loved the cut-out detail in the back. It was so much fun to dance in, and pockets are always an added bonus. Only issue I had was that I found that the waistline fit tight along my rib cage. I was surprised that it was that tight since I usually wear a 4 or 6, and the 6 was the size I chose to wear for the wedding (mostly because of that issue). I'm sure that tightness helps for not having to wear a bra with the dress (a bra was absolutely not necessary, but I'm also small-chested), but the fit was great otherwise, so I was surprised at that issue. Either way, I would definitely rent it again.","July 27, 2017","True to Size"

I have a small waist and the 6 fit well, but was pretty snug. Unless you have a superrrrr small waist, I would suggest ordering the size up and have your back-up size be two sizes up. I'm a 34C/D and can rarely go braless, but I went braless with this dress and it was perfect!

I wore this to a Christening and had no issue with the bare back, I loved the back of the dress. I did receive a lot of compliments that day of but I think it was prettier in person than in photos.

They add interest to the dress without being revealing. I would even wear this to work. As with every Badgley Miscka dress I've tried to date, the fit is superb, classy, sexy and super comfortable. Don't be on the fence with this one, it's a keeper!","January 8, 2019","True to Size"

Since it was a work related event I was concerned about the cut-outs, but they were a nice extra detail. I have broad shoulders and a long torso, so the high neck and more Racerback cut were perfect.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM417","RTR Customer","Beautiful color","I'm about 110 lbs, 5'5. I rented the 0 and 2. Both were roomy in the bust, but that is normal for me because I'm pretty small up top. The 0 actually fit better but the seam along the left breast area laid weird so I went with the 2. I've worn 2's from RTR in the past and this brand just seemed to run a little bigger. Even with a padded strapless bra with a Nu Bra insert, it was roomy. The dress itself is cute and has a beautiful blue cobalt color. Overall it was a good rental, but wasn't my favorite RTR mostly because I couldn't fill out the bust. The cutouts are very tasteful and still felt like a classy dress.","November 14, 2018","Wedding"

It was very comfortable even though it was fitted and I loved the edginess of the cut outs on your waist. The length was also great since I'm tall and I hate shorter dresses (the butt always makes it ride up more). The color was great as well, always fun to wear something other than black. I was able to wear a strapless bra with this, however my bra had a little extra material on the bottom so I made sure to yank it up a couple times just to be sure it didn't peek through the cut-out. I got a lot of complements as well! So I now ordered the coral color of the same dress for another upcoming wedding.","October 4, 2018","True to Size"

The back dips down a bit in the back so I wore a strapless bra I had to push down. If I wasn't at a work event, I could have gone braless.

It does bunch up above the rear which is why I included 3 pictures in my review, so you can truly see where the fabric hitches up. I never had any problem with it riding up, and I wore it for a long night. The back harness is a bit strange which is mentioned in several other reviews. The length is nice, but what I really enjoyed was how it made me feel and the fabric is thick, so no need for a bra either.","July 21, 2018","True to Size"

I am only 5'2"" so many dresses are longer on me than they are meant to be, but this one was a great length -- not to long, but not too short. The only criticism I had was that since I like my dresses to be more snug, the back v-cut puckered a little bit. The back clasp was also a little cheap looking -- it was different on the size 2 and the size 4, so I imagine that it needed to be replaced on one of the dresses.","September 25, 2017","True to Size"

The other thing I didn't like about it was that the lining kept coming out by the arms and neckline. A pretty dress by a little unforgiving in the middle section.

I would say it does run small, and if you have an hourglass figure you might even consider sizing up twice. I typically fall in a 14, but ordered the 16 as my backup. It fit, but revealed every single line. I had to wear full non control top pantyhose (in a very muggy September in VA) to avoid vbl and shape-wear lines. The zipper also had a strange bulge in the middle of the zipper, pulling the dress up or down didn’t help either.

I wore an adhesive bra with it- all others would have shown. Highly recommend it. Love this dress!","April 10, 2020","Large"

As other have said, the blue is beautiful and much brighter in person- between a navy and a royal blue. The dress was somewhat form fitting, but the material was stretchy and soft like a jersey while concealing any lumps and bumps. The flutter sleeve was lovely, and the way it cut across the back on the bias was incredibly flattering. The hem hit me an inch or two below the knee- I'm pretty short so I usually worry about longer dresses making me look even shorter, but I actually loved the silhouette it created. The bust was a bit more low and revealing than I might typically wear to a work function, but I have to say my bust has perhaps never looked better in a dress!!

The fit was great, hugged me in all the right places but was forgiving in areas that needed forgiveness. :-) The only recommendation I have is that you'll need a lower profile bra.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LRL23","M","Classy, comfy and fun","I rented the 2 and 4 since I fluctuate between those sizes, and wore the size 2--both were tight in the waist, but the size 4 was a bit loose in the straps. I was able to wear a regular (smooth, not textured) bra, but I had to tuck the hanger loops into the inside of my bra so they didn't create a lumpy texture on my chest. I also recommend seamless underwear without any texture (not even lace). This dress is tight all around and does not hide any stomach rolls, so if you think you would be self-conscious, I recommend a different style. I paired it with pearls got compliments ranging from hot to sophisticated--a rare find for the lower priced rentals. I loved the asymmetrical style and the flowy fabric over one arm and around the back to the other side--this made it feel fun, especially when it caught the breeze. It was a good choice for an outdoor wedding in sweltering heat, but I also think it would have worked for an indoor winter wedding.

Thankfully I rented another dress as a backup - one that was less formal - but it served its purpose. My advice: it does run large, so go a size down what you might think.

With respect to the top of the dress, I couldn't really find a bra that worked, so ended up going without a bra, which gave me anxiety, but ended up working out just fine. The spaghetti straps were WAY too long but I solved that by pulling the two straps together in the back, like a racer-back style and securing them with a safety pin.

The pockets were amazing, and the skirt was a heavy almost tapestry-like fabric. I am so petite I typically cannot wear these full skirts as they eat me up, but this one was perfect (and hit the little food baby belly after enjoying a great dinner and a glass of wine!). The downside - what everyone said about the straps was correct....I'm not sure who this was made for esp not being adjustable! I ended up double safety-pinning both sides, taking it up approx. 3 inches. I wore a black strapless bra but still wished I had used fashion tape as well. All-in-all, as long as you have the patience and time before your event starts to tailor this, definitely worth the rental!

I was SO uncomfortable and self-conscious the whole evening! Lol. I did use fabric tape and a NuBra but still felt as though I was on full display. In addition, the cut of the dress isn't quite right- it showed my small waist but the skirt cut made me look pregnant and cut off at a weird spot. Overall, I wish I had stuck to my gut of being more conservative for a good friends wedding. Pretty dress, just not for me. Hope this helps!","November 10, 2018","Wedding"

The bottom flows away so you'll be sizing mostly for your chest and ribcage versus needing to worry about the rest of the dress. As other reviews have mentioned, the straps are long, but this worked well for my long torso; I was also glad to have a skirt that went to my knees.

The dress has wiring in the front, which gives it a beautiful shape, but makes it especially challenging to sit down if it’s already tight. Even though it was uncomfortable (because I CHOSE to wear the tighter dress) I was glad I wore it because it was super form-fitting. I got so many compliments, and I really loved how I looked in it.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JS51","Elyse","Great for Straight & Narrow Body Types!","I ordered this dress as a back up option for a wedding in which I am serving as the MOH. The dress itself is fantastic and gives us less curvy girls a shape, which instantly boosted my confidence and made me feel sexy and proud of my new ""shape"". It fits TTS with slightly more room in the hips and bust. I likely also would have worn spanx for photos. The con: Unfortunately this dress came wrinkled w/ some soiling at the bottom of the dress to the back of my knees. The structured bust line had seen better days and had essentially collapsed as it was hanging down. The bust in this dress new fits beautifully. I was in Chicago & was able to return this in person to the very friendly salespeople and believe this specific dress has been taken out of rotation or repaired. I would not have been able to wear this dress in the wedding due to the condition that it arrived in. Dress itself, fantastic. QC leaves some to be desired.","July 6, 2017","Wedding"

The dress fit like a glove and hugged me in all the right places. The simplicity of the dress really shows off its elegance and I received many compliments. The only complaint I have is that the dress on the bottom came a little wrinkled so if you're iffy about those things you may wants to rent it for two days before your event so you can get it steamed. Other than that the dress was super comfortable (a little long but I am very short) and really enjoyable to wear.","June 10, 2017","Other"

Didn't even try the 4 on because 2 fit perfect. At 5'5, 120 pounds, and an A cup it was perfect. Didn't even wear a bra. Bonus! I would love to actually buy it!

They initially sent me the wrong color, (this dress comes in two different shades of ""nude"") but they had the correct color/size sent via overnight when I called them about the mistake. No questions asked. Great customer service.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JS51","RTR Customer","Felt like a princess for the night!","I rented this to wear as a bridesmaid's dress and it was amazing! I was a little worried about the fit since most reviews said the gown runs on the small side (it does). I usually wear a 2 so I ordered a 2 and a 4. The 2 wasn't going past my hips but the 4 was much better. It fit comfortably without a bra, but a strapless bra made it a little tough to zip. My fiance was able to zip it no problem but I didn't want to rely on him all night so I got the adhesive bra and it was perfect. With a three inch heal the length was great, even when I switched to flip flops at the reception it was only slightly too long. Not a big deal at all. Walking and dancing were not a problem; sitting was a bit of am effort but the plus side is the dress encourages excellent posture :). Also, the color of the dress is exactly as shown. I got so many compliments on this gown, one guest even said she hoped I got to wear the dress again because of how stunning and flattering it was.

I'm a B cup, so a little on the smaller side, but I still expected the dress to fit better than it did. I managed to work it out, but I had to be pulling the dress up all night. Other than that, I adored it. I felt incredible and got so many great components all night, including one from someone who said I looked like Grace Kelly! It was a little hard to dance in because it's form fitting, but I didn't mind because it brought out curves I didn't know I had! The material is great, nice and thick but still feels light and flowy. It was the perfectly length with my heels, so I'm glad I didn't get a long like I considered. I highly recommend this dress and this whole site!","May 5, 2016","Formal Affair"

I was really happy with the dress!! The color is definitely more of a beige with pink tones than ""pink"" (although the flash in these pictures makes it look much more pink) still it was perfect for spring. I ordered the 4R and 6R based off of reviews from the blush color, the dress fit everywhere well except it was a bit tight on my chest which unfortunately is quite common for me. I am 5'3 and a 34D, the dress zipped up and I survived the night, but was one of those situations where I couldn't exactly take in a big deep breath all night. This dress does NOT have much give, I wore this to an opera event so I was essentially sitting all evening.. definitely would not recommend it if you plan on dancing the night away. I opted for my shorter more comfortable heels for the evening so in the picture it looks like it's dragging a bit on the floor but it wasn't an issue, would be normal length with average heels. All in all the dress was beautiful! So glad I chose this dress.","April 29, 2016","Small"

The bust is definitely more fitted and has a built in bustier, so it's best for smaller cup sizes. The waist and hips are more fitted with little to no give in the fabric, so I'd recommend sizing up for curvier hips. At 5'7"" I would have preferred the long length to accommodate 3-4 inch heels.

This style is fitted at the waist and hips but is not too tight. Its great for any cup size and can be worn with a strapless bra. At 5ft, the length hit tea length on me. Pair with nude heels and a bracelet to complete this look!","December 28, 2018","True to Size"

It did fight a bit tight in the rib cage- I had to switch to a less padded bra to get it to zip up! The rest of the dress was flowy & fit normal. No spanks needed for this one! I loved the sheer lace on the bottom- it really gave it a modern style. It was comfortable & never fell down or showed too much cleavage. There's an elastic strap & hook inside near the waist that helps it stay in place- clever design idea! I would love to rent this again! It's a great dress.","June 6, 2019","Small"

Also I was 16 weeks pregnant for this November wedding and the dress made me feel great. I wore a black tank underneath even though I didn't think I would because the cut was a little too low for me for a wedding, but it was also really pretty without it - as long as you have the right bra for it. This dress material really isn't stretchy at all, so don't expect it to give. Overall I really liked it and thought it was perfect for what I needed it for.","November 16, 2018","Wedding"

It is much cuter in person than what comes across in photos. It's actually a sparkly blue instead of black accent which surprised me but great for fall! I wore this to a rehearsal dinner for a wedding and it was the perfect length. The dress did have some fit issues for me- it was extremely tight in the waist (I am usually an 8 but this one I wish I had a 10) and hard to zip but then was huge in the busy and shoulders. I had to pin across the back to bring the straps in and then tape around the bust to keep everything in (and I am not large chested at all). That being said it was great to have pockets and I got so many compliments! The dress did have some pulls in the fabric when it arrived so just be careful about tucking those back in if you rent it.","October 22, 2018","Wedding"

The only issue I had, was in the chest area. The black from the inside of the dress was popping out, if that makes sense? Almost like the fabric from the inside was rolling over onto the outside... but it wasn't anything that would make me not want to wear this again.

Just can't beat a comfortable party dress with pockets!","This dress was very comfortable and perfect for a Christmas cocktail party. The cut is a little lower than I expected, but it made it seem a little more elegant. The shirt is much more full than I expected it to fall, so some angles don't look great on this dress! The material is woven, and the dark blue sections have a little bit of a sparkle/shine to it. I wished the waist hit a little lower - but this would be PERFECT for someone with a little bit of a stomach (or even a lot of one). The pockets were deep and I carried my phone, lipstick, gloss and a hair pin without it showing. I am 5'5, 32DD-34D and weigh about 140. Depending on the dress/style, I can sometimes be between a 4 and a 6. The 4 was perfect - maybe even SLIGHTLY large. It does have a little give to it - but do not plan on it melding to you. The 6 was way too big and VERY low. I didn't wear a bra and was comfortable all night. The material is a little thick, perfect for a cool (not cold) night without a jacket. I'll definitely keep this in mind in the future.","January 3, 2017","True to Size"

It has the tiniest bit of shine to it in the dark blue undertones, and just glints when it catches the light. It is low cut, but not to the point of feeling uncomfortable- and you don't need some kind of special bra. You can wear a pretty standard low. It bra. Awesome dress!","December 19, 2016","Party"

You don’t need a bra with this dress which is amazing. As you can see, when sitting the slot rides up a bit. The only gripe I have about this dress is the small buttons above the zipper in the back, the button holes were so small that it took a while to button them in. The dress is easy to move in and super comfortable.","September 24, 2019","True to Size"

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted at the natural waist and loose at the hips.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size as your primary size and going one size up as your backup. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works best for A-C cups sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this gown so you should wear no bra since it has a halter neckline. At 5'5, the length hit floor length on me. The grey crinkle chiffon material is flowy and the color is a great dark neutral if you're looking for an effortless look for your event. Pair with black heels and diamond earrings to complete your outfit!","March 5, 2019","True to Size"

Because of the cut and fitted quality, I wouldn't recommend trying to get into or out of it yourself. Or trying to drive - you have limited mobility. Finally, the slit is wonderfully sassy, but my usual spanx shorts were too long (and don't try to roll those suckers up unless you want to harsh your own vibe).

The 8 was tight, but the 10 I had as backup had a faulty zipper that came off track and I had to get into the 8. Once in it though, it was fine and I didn't feel like it was too small.

You definitely need a backup size, because there are lots of areas to ""fit"" - chest, arms, hips. But I loved it, and would definitely rent it again.

Make sure to size up if you have broad shoulders. I was worried that the rest of the dress would be too big, but it was still very flattering without being super fitted in the hip area. (Also, the fabric is that nice thick holds-you-in kind.) The tightness of the shoulder area still nipped the waist in well. Also, it was surprisingly comfortable!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ML150","RTR Customer","Beautiful sexy pirate sleeves.","Cons: That neckline. Because of the off the shoulder and how it's stitched to the torso, you cannot lift your arms to vertical. Hands on hips was actually rough. Couldn't put on my own shoes. No high fives. No passing a napkin. We didn't dance, but there was no way I could have my arms where they should be in a partner dance (salsa, waltz, whatevs). It was longer than I think it should be, but the slit helps. Pros: That neckline. It was in the perfect spot, it didn't dip down and accented my neck and face was a clean, sharp line. & those sleeves though. They are so pretty. Beauty is pain ladies. And not even pain in this case, just annoying. Those sleeves are gorge and this sexy pirate look was getting a lot of attention. Fit perfectly, hugged my curves correctly. Color was perfect. Think burnt orange-red. It stands out SO much that it's really a wear-one-time kinda dress. But with that neckline, not sure I want to wear it 2 times anyways.

Still, the dress was super comfortable and fun to dance in - very flapper/20s vibe.

Everyone really seemed to like this dress (a few people went as to far as to comment on my dress in the photos I posted online). A lot of people were in blue that night, but the cutouts of lace in the dress seemed to make it stand out. The cut-outs are a little see-through, but as most of the reviews indicated, if you have a nude colored bra, it is no problem at all. I wore the 4, because there was too much bunched fabric in the chest area with the 6 (although the fit around the waist was a little bit more snug in the 4-- nothing close to being unbearable, though).

Do not forget the stick-on bra; strapless will still show through the lace on the back. I had to get creative and use clear packing tape and bra fillers. The bust of the dress does not have enough structure to go bra-less unless you have a bigger cup size and could maybe fill it out.

I received compliments all night on the color and style of the dress and it was comfortable. The laced sleeves and higher neckline give it a classy appeal and the cut out and length make it just the right amount of sassy.

The dress is not stretchy and has little give, which resulted in me wearing the bigger size (8) (for measurement purposes I'm 5'3"" 140lbs and am between a 6 & 8, typically wearing a 6).

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM154","Alyssa","More compliments than I could count","I was stopped by complete strangers on the way into my event that just had to tell me how much they loved my dress. This out of the blue complementing went on all night. It was both flattering and a wholly new experience for me. This was actually my 2nd choice for the dresses I ordered, but I loved this one in person much more than I originally thought I would. I'm basically 5 feet tall so I always have to hem things and a petite did not come in the size I needed. I wore 3.5 inch heels but still had to use hem tape to take the dress up another 2 inches and it fell just to the tops of my shoes. Even with my inexperienced hemming the dress still moved beautifully. My only true problem with the dress is that there was no little plastic straps to hang it up by so after all the hanging it's done the lace that forms the shoulder straps is stretched out and causes the straps to have an odd gaping in the back.","September 11, 2017","Formal Affair"

I wore it to my best friend's black tie wedding, it was breathable and my husband loved it so much he asked how much it would be to buy it! Because of the cut in the back I wore one of those front only sticky bras and it was snug enough to keep me comfortable and ""held in."" Just be aware that for some reason the site shows the dress as a royal blue, but mine was navy - which I preferred, but the reviews show it in different tones so just know that you may get Navy and you may get royal blue. Customer service was no help in clarifying which color I would receive.","May 25, 2017","Wedding"

The dress is tight from the top to just past the butt. The material is spandex or spandex like so it was very comfortable and moves with you. The regular length was perfect with about 3 inch heel.

I wore it for a cocktail Gala, and it was completely appropriate. I was the only one wearing a jumpsuit, and I felt a little bit invincible! It is a bit strange to take the thing all the way off to use the restroom - odd to be totally naked in a public place - but it wasn't too hard to get on and off. I'm pretty exactly an 8 in dresses/jumpsuits/jackets, and this fit really well, and even had a little bit of wiggle room, but the six probably would have been uncomfortably tight. No need to wear a bra, as the ruffle covers the bust. I did have to adjust the shoulders on and off throughout the night, and the zipper was a little irritating under my arm but I got used to it as the night went on. Overall, it worked great.

The waist on the size 4 was too tight (there is no stretch), although the rest of the garment fit well.

Cool, size 20P then. Perfect. So, that's why there aren't 5 stars. This dress will remind you that you're not a Barbie shaped creature, but - I felt like a princess on the red carpet.

My only complaint is that the waist band has ZERO GIVE to it so it was extremely tight around my rib cage. I had to go up one dress size just to even get it to close.

It arrived a day earlier than expected and the free second size really allowed my to decide what I liked best. The fit was true to size in my opinion. I actually wear a 12 or large in everyday clothes (slacks, jeans, t-shirts, etc) and both the 12 and the 14 fit me but I had a bit more breathing room in the 14. I carry my weight in my stomach and thighs so the flow of the dress hid that beautifully. I loved the sexy, not-too-revealing top and the occasional peak-a-boo of the leg. I got so many compliments!!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AMU85","Jennifer","Beautiful flowy dress, but a little large","I rented this lovely dress for my baby shower when I was 32 weeks pregnant, in my third trimester. The dress is a vibrant color, and the silk material feels really rich with a good weight. However, the dress did flare out a lot, making it way too large for me. I wore a size small, but had also rented the M. The M was like a tent and the keyhole front was really large, and gaped below my breast line. The S fit a little better where the keyhole did not gape as much, and ended at a decent location on my chest. I did use some bobby pins to pin in a placket down my back to try and gather the material closer to the torso and belly so the dress looked more fitted, which worked in a pinch, especially as I had my hair down for most of the shower. the neck ruffles also helped conceal the placket as well in the back. I'm usually a size small so I'd recommend renting your normal size and a size down for this dress, and try my temporary pinning trick to get a better fit - each person's belly is different!","March 18, 2020","Large"

The dress was absolutely beautiful in person and I received SO many compliments about it and the color. I felt stunning! Pockets were a great addition. Warning: the lining of the dress made it extremely hot (for me). I live in a cooler (northern) climate and wore this on a cloudy day that was about 55 degrees outside. Once inside for dancing, it was wet with sweat and stayed that way all night. I dance A LOT but sweat is usually not that much of an issue for me. It was a bit uncomfortable.

But I read the reviews, and people of all shapes and sizes seemed to love it so I went with it and I'm so glad I did! It may be my favorite rental to date! It just fits so well and really makes you look amazing! I didn't need to wear a bra with it and had no issues with it staying up or anything. Easy to move in unless you need to raise your arms up high. My husband couldn't close his mouth all night, it is a stunner! I actually want to buy this dress, it's so great!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EF182","Megan","Comfortable and classic","The dress is very comfortable and a pretty color. It's not exactly red thanks to the white lace overlay, so it feels less ""lady in red"" for a wedding. It was fitted nicely at the top. The bottom is a little bulky feeling and I thought it looked a little heavy for me, but it's not unlike the picture shows, so it wasn't a surprise. Also, I was between the R and the L, being 5'8"". I opted for the L and wore higher heels, however I did find myself holding it off the floor a lot, especially while dancing, in order to avoid tripping or stepping on it (myself and/or others!). I paired it with nude heels and a nude bag, and my grandmother's necklace sitting on the neckline. The pattern makes it so you can keep the jewelry simple without looking unfinished.

I'm typically not one to wear red but this dress incorporates nude and hints of coral as well. Its easy to wear and is conservative yet sexy at the same time. I received so many compliments! Cons: Let me preface these cons by saying the design of the dress is not at fault here. The 4P was not available so even with a heel the 4R was a bit long for my height. I just had to be mindful to pick up so I didn't trip. The second con was that about 3/4"" of my bra wanted to show on each side. I was able to remedy this with double sided tape. Again, not the dresses fault, it was recommended for up to a C cup and I am a DD.

If you are lucky enough to not have to wear a bra, go for it! Overall, I really loved the dress!

It was a bit snug for me, but not uncomfortable. The straps were super long so I had to pin them back, which was fine. The sequins were beautiful and there wasn't any wear on the sequins or stitching. The length was perfect for me, I am 5'2"" and I wore shorter heels.

It was just the right balance of glitz and glam without being way over the top. The sequins are matte but they shimmer just enough in the light. The 10 was just the right length for me (I'm 5' 3"") and was just loose enough in the body to be comfortable and wasn't feeling like I was going to explode out of it. I was getting compliments on this dress all night and felt fabulous! There were a few cons. The straps on this are WAY too long and WAY too flimsy. I definitely had to use safety pins to shorten them and I was freaking out all night that one of the straps were going to snap because they were so thin. I rented the 12R as my back up and let's just say the sizing between the 10 and the 12 is baffling. The 12 was HUGE everywhere, the straps were at least 4 inches longer, so at 5' 3"", there was no way I could wear it because there was about 10 inches of dress at the bottom. The sequins do catch a bit on other fabrics so you should be careful with that. But I didn't have any issues or irritation under my arms from them so that's a plus! Despite the cons, it truly is a beautiful dress and would certainly rent it again!","July 23, 2017","Formal Affair"

I'm not sure how truly tall women would do with this dress. My shape is very rectangular, and this dress wasn't particularly suited to flatter me. HOWEVER, I felt amazing in it!

The dress is relatively comfortable, hardest part for me, as a tiny chested lady, was finding a sticky bra that fit. I will say ""true to size"" because it fit in the body well and the neck held the dress up with no fault.

I haven't worn a 2 in years but could have with this dress. I don't know if it is because it was sleeveless and somewhat backless, which is wear a 2 is often tight on me. I am a petite shape with a small waist. I was able to wear this braless with pasties since it was backless-ish. Didn't want to deal with a sticky type bra. It was so comfortable.

The wrap part in the chest area didn't sit very well on my chest and gapped a lot when sitting down. There are also some weird spaghetti straps in the back that kept sticking out which makes the dress seem less classy (I wore a strapless bra so didn't have to worry about bra straps - not sure if that would have had the same issue). Other than those two minor details, I loved how flowy this dress was. It's a super flattering fit and color. It wasn't tight around the ribs/arms which are normally my problem areas.

The cobalt blue is fabulous, photos don't do it justice. The top is fitted with little to no give. You can wear a regular bra, but consider a nude colored one because it could show through depending on your bust size or color choice.

Comfortable and well-constructed, with a feminine silhouette and flirty hemline. I didn't find much difference between the 2&4, outside of the bust, which is why I decided on the 4. Overall the dress runs true to size based on your bust and waist and gives a lot of extra room in the hips, which makes it an excellent choice for hourglass figures or fellow big booty gals. Also, the color is much richer in person. I'd definitely recommend this dress.","May 20, 2018","Wedding"

My only issue was the zipper...OMG seriously took ten minutes to try to zip it, and it was not because it was too tight, it was because the zipper was janky. My husband ended up getting his needle nose pliers out and that did the trick.

It was breathable enough that I was cool during the late afternoon ceremony but still kept me warm in the evening. I loved the asymmetry of the hemline - it was a really interesting detail. I'm 5'5"" and it hit just below the knee for me. My only minor complaint is the the bust is sewn together and gapped a bit on me (size 34D bust). The size up was too big around the waist and hips so I stuck with the size down despite the gapping. Ladies with larger busts but narrow hips may notice more gapping at the top of the dress.","August 23, 2017","Large"

I wore a regular bra. (My back-up size was a 10, which was too loose, but I don't think the 6 would have worked as it might have been too small in the armholes.)

Because of my small bust, the faux wrap front didn't lay quite right - one side kind of sagged at the bottom. The lace is lightweight but feels high quality, so I stayed nice and cool. Despite some of the fit shortcomings, it ended up being perfect for the somewhat-casual outdoor wedding I attended!","May 29, 2019","Large"

I got a 2 and 4 and went with the 4 because the 2 was too tight in the shoulders. There is an attached slip underneath and a normal (nude colored) bra can be worn. Unfortunately the dart keeping the neckline closed was ripped off on my dress so I had to return it without wearing it. I didn't like the way it looked with the slip showing and the bust had been stretched out also. RTR was so helpful though and gave me a full credit on return.

The front felt very conservative, but I loved the dramatic back so much that I went for it!

A size 10 fit perfect around my hips and bust with enough breathing room to eat and sit through the rest of the night. Cons: The sequins on the side rubs on the inside of your arms all night which can cause chaffing. I ended up spraying some ""pre-heels"" which prevented friction, I'm sure deodorant will help as well! Because the dress is filled with sequins, it at times gets stuck on each other when trying to sit down. Other than that, the dress was gorgeous and I felt so glamorous!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TA106","RTR Customer","Company holiday party (semi-formal)","Fun dress! The colors for the sequins are really rich and unusual; tough to match jewelry with but easy to match makeup. Tall girls rejoice - I'm 5'11"" and this hit just a bit above the knee. The back really gives no way to wear a bra, and I didn't wear anything for support (38D), although admittedly my event didn't have dancing. I was planning on taping myself up but once I put the dress on, I didn't feel at risk of anything slipping out - the back is open but not the sides, and the texture of the sequins keeps anything ""personal"" from showing. The draped cowl back is not structured the way I expected - it's a separate sash of material, which looks a little silly on the hanger but I think is fine in person.","December 12, 2016","True to Size"

The back is out in this dress and I wear a 36d bra. Yikes, again! Because everything was so rushed, I ended up having to duct tape these bad boys up and viola! As the night wore on, the dress grew on me and I ended up loving it. I received tons of compliments. It was sophisticated yet sexy and sparkly!

I wore it for Labor Day in Vegas and loved having a bright color in contrast to all of the black that everyone was wearing. In terms of fit - this definitely runs very small, I'm typically a 2 or 4 and the 8 fit me well (as you can see in pics). I did find the length to be a little weird so I actually rolled up the longer layer a bit at the waist to make it a couple inches shorter which I found to be more flattering/more in line with the style. In terms of quality - honestly this did not feel like a $1700 dress at all. The zipper felt chintzy and the lace felt a bit well worn. Could just be that this particular dress had been worn a bit more than others but I did find quality to be a bit lacking. I don't think that necessarily shows, but you can feel it.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DLM30","Marlene","Very comfortable and forgiving dress! Great for everyday, date or casual event.","I really enjoyed this dress! It was so comfy and easy to wear, and since we were having a family dinner I didn't feel like I needed it more fitted. If I had worn this to a reunion, it would be more flattering fitted. I'm 5'2"" and about 125 lbs in this pic but I did have to wear a push up bra to make it look more fitted and flattering. If you have skinny arms then the sleeves may hang down annoyingly, but if you have really beefy arms, they may be too tight. I'd recommend getting this with a back up size depending on yours. It isn't really too fitted anywhere else, if anything, it's a bit baggy. I don't know how this would look on a really petite framed person, especially if they have narrow or sloped shoulders. In that case size down. This definitely would look great on hourglass or athletic fit. If you are pear shaped, it will depend on how much difference the shoulders and the hips are, the greater the difference, the less likely, as you need to size up to hips but the shoulders/arms/ribs will start getting too baggy looking.","April 18, 2017","Date"

It was very form fitting and I was wild about the draped piece across the chest. I received compliments right and left wearing this one and will likely rent it for a future event. If I did not mention before, I LOVED THIS DRESS!","October 22, 2015","True to Size"

I was worried about getting a dress to fit since I'm 6 months pregnant. This dress accommodated my bump amazingly. The fabric is stretchy, and with all the ruching I didn't feel like I was squeezing into it at all. I love the drapey thing on the shoulders, I disguised my bump amazingly. I'm normally a solid 8, and wore a 12. The 10 did not fit. I wish I had ordered the 12L so I could wear heels, I am 5'6"" and the dress barely hit the floor in flats. The sequins were a little itchy around the armpits but that's a small price to pay for looking and feeling amazing for a night!","October 13, 2015","True to Size"

I tried on every bra I owned and couldn't find one to wear with this dress that didn't make me look like I had on a push-up. This dress is definitely intended for small chest (A-cup)! I realized later I should've worn without a bra to de-emphasis the cleavage. Also wore this to a NYE wedding as I loved the subtle sparkle. The sparkles don't photograph well.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/HTC4","Dana","Fun Party Dress","I loved this dress! I'm just over 5'10"", 140lbs and have a 34D bust. This dress fit phenomenally. It was a fun party dress. It has a structured cut and thick rich material, hold its silhouette and screams quality! Just enough sparkle to be fun, subtle striped print and simple iconic cut. Has a classic 'Mad Men' vibe while still feeling relevant and modern. I gravitate towards Audrey Hepburn/ Jackie Kennedy inspired cuts and this dress hit that note. Super classy and fun. I received compliments all night, and felt perfectly dressed while at a cocktail party held at one of the most exclusive clubs on Park Ave. My figure runs long and lean (sharp prominent shoulders, narrow hips and modest bust) but this would work with most body types because of the full, stiff skirt. If you are really busty or have a broad rib cage/back I'd order up in size to avoid mashed disfigured boobs or zipper malfunctions. This may not be the dress for my very well endowed sisters or those who are super petite! I'd buy this dress in a second!

I'm generally in between a 4 and a 6, and the 6 fit perfectly-- the 4 was tight around my shoulders and fit a bit uncomfortably under my arms. The dress falls fairly straight, but is flattering around the hips and the thicker fabric is very forgiving. I highly recommend this dress-- you'll be receiving compliments all night!","March 7, 2017","Formal Affair"

It's pretty short, but not so short that you could wear without tights, but I have no tan right now, so I wore sheer tights. I felt great all evening and received many compliments on the dress. I was going to wear pumps, but ended up wearing booties. It was great for a Feb party in the mountains!","February 21, 2017","True to Size"

It's a great length and cut, and worked perfectly while dancing at the wedding.","February 15, 2017","Small"

Wore for my anniversary dinner on a chilly February night in Chicago. Super fun detail with the sleeves. It was a tad tight in the upper arms, so if you work out at all and have muscular arms I would size up, but I wasnt moving or dancing so it wasnt an issue. I am a true 8 and the 8 fit perfect. The sleeves did not get in the way at dinner, which I was a little worried about. Fabric is great quality. I felt great in this dress!","February 13, 2017","True to Size"

This is the one they sent and it was so much fun. I'm 5'9"" and I never felt like the dress was too short. It is definitely 35"" and hit 4"" above the knee. The sleeves are amazing but I can see how other reviewers may be tight on some. Plenty of room in the hips and stomach. So much fun to dance in.

I got this dress as a backup and was nervous as there were no reviews yet.

The dress was really comfortable and easy to move around in. The color was really pretty too. For wise I am a 36D and I almost feel like the top was a tad big for my bust but the arm holes for well as did the waist. I do feel like it was a little boxy, but I don't think a size 12 would've fit my waist. I wore Spanx, but really they weren't needed for the dress because of the shape. The length was just past my knees and I am 5'6"". I wore 4"" heels and the length was still good. The zipper was sticking a bit so getting it on and off I was thankful for the little additional wiggle room in the bodice.","January 21, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL170","Amanda","Looked amazing but not comfortable","When I originally tried on this dress I didn't see much difference between the 4 and the 6. 4 was maybe a little tighter in the ribs but not uncomfortable. They both did up easily. I decided to go with the 6 just to be more comfy at the holiday party I was going to. However as soon as I sat down in the dress I could feel the fabric on my ribs digging in. This dress doesn't have much stretch on the waist and as soon as I started eating I could feel the fabric digging in more. It wasn't a very comfortable dress to wear and although I thought it looked really nice I probably wouldn't rent it again.","December 20, 2018","Party"

The length on me was perfect, it hit at the knee. For reference I'm 5'1, 133 pounds. The zipper was a bit of an issue and I need assistance from my husband getting it up, not from being tight, but just from being a difficult zipper.

I wore it to a winter wedding with my boyfriend where I was meeting his family and many of his close friends for the first time, so I wanted to find something that was pretty and tasteful, but not too flashy. As other reviewers mentioned, the fabric doesn't have a ton of give. I measured in between the 0 and 2 on the ML size chart, but the 2 was already reserved. It took a small army to get me into the dress, and it took some restraint at the reception, but it was totally worth it.","May 10, 2018","True to Size"

It is tighter around the rib cage and there is no give so I would size up for your back up, you'll also need help getting it zipped. There is enough support that I did not need to wear a bra. The top and back is lace and if you needed a bra you could probably get away with wearing a nude one or a low back strapless one as the lace is see through but it's hard to notice unless you're really paying attention to it. The lace on it was the perfect touch and really sets it off. It also has pockets, which was great! I was able to carry my phone with me and lip gloss and you could not tell at all.

My husband had to help. I honestly don't think I could have worn this dress if I was flying solo to an event. On the Pro side; the color is stunning and the design with the open/cape back will catch eyes. I ordered this for my Rehearsal Dinner- I almost wish I wore it to my wedding!! I went a size up (usually size 10, went with a 12) and the overall fit was very comfortable. I was able to sit down for dinner without any pulling or tugging. I do have a large chest so the dress hugged just a little bit in that area. Bottom Line, I am so happy with this beautiful dress.

This dress has very little stretch and runs small. The material is thick and it’s lined so it’s hot (beware!). The dress is very flattering and I got lots of compliments. For reference I’m 5’5 with an athletic build (big booty), 36DD, 150lbs. Now for the bad...the zipper on the garment bag I almost had to rip it open, it was seriously stuck (stressful!). The zipper on the dress itself also sucked and it took my husband and I 15 min (no joke) to work the zipper and get it up. Lastly, I could definitely tell the dress had been worn many times. There was obvious wear under the arms and down the side of the dress there was a little pulling. It wasn’t terrible but it didn’t look new like I expected. I’d rate it a 7/10 experience overall, it was good but there is room for RTR to improve.","August 29, 2018","Small"

You will need a second, and maybe even a third set of hands, as it curves up the side of the dress. You will need to twist a bit to get it zippered, and I would suggest going up a size to make it easier. BUT, this dress made me look so thin and tall, I was obsessed. Much longer than I would normally wear (hit me just below the knee, I'm 5"") but it was sleek and sexy while still allowing me to dance and eat.

Instead, (the racer back bra looked better than a strapless with this dress cut) my bra peaked out the entire time and I kept trying to push it back in. To my large chested ladies, go camo all the way with this one...it holds everything in place! I felt super sexy!

So Rent The Runway customer service came to save the day and chose this dress for me. Looked at it really quick on the phone and went with it in a size 6. This dress was great! It was just a teeny bit snug on me but it didn't bug me at all. It was a simple dress but with a little pizazz with the upper back detail. Super comfortable too! Would recommend for sure!","May 29, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CAS32","Molly","Great dress!","This dress fit perfectly. I didn't have to wear a bra (a tough feat for a D cup) because of the thick material.

The color is more purple than blue, but is really elegant. The dress is a bit snug but is very flattering for someone with curves. It is formal enough for a nice event, but the back detailing makes it still fun and youthful for a wedding or something like that. The zipper- as I had read on other reviews- is a bit difficult, but as long as you have someone who can help zip it up it's fine. I would definitely rent it again!","May 14, 2018","True to Size"

I did have to ask a friend to zip up the dress (since my fiancé was in the wedding and not able to help!!) as the zipper was very hard to do. I probably could have tried a 4 on instead of the 6. The 8 was extremely large on me.","March 17, 2018","Large"

It was tasteful for being around my family, and still had some personality with the little cape and cutout in the back. Color was the rich purple I expected. I was glad I'd read reviews that it runs small. I'm normally a solid 6 (occasionally a 4) and the 8 fit wonderfully -- tight enough up top that I didnt need a bra (34C) and straight-cut enough at the bottom that it didnt hug in weird ways. Zipper was finicky as others mentioned but I didn't have much problem with it. Overall a wonderful experience to have the perfect dress waiting for me at my hotel.

I almost didn't go to the wedding because I didn't think I could get it on over my head- be sure to not get your hair done before putting this thing on. It is true, the color is a very deep, almost purple color. Nice for the fall and the fabric is thick with some stretch. The 8 fit, but not pulled on over my head.

I wore my back up size. I gave it only 4 stars bc the parricular dress that was sent to me was hell to get out of. Idk if it wasnt well made or if the dress had been a little worn out, but the zipper got caught and wouldn't budge. My husband had to literally tear it off.

I always want the option to go up a size. Unfortunately I just had to take the chance and order only one size. The reviews talked about the terrible zipper. I had the same experience, but what I found was using a little blue crayon on the zipper to get it both up and down was the trick!! After using the crayon, the zipper went up without much tugging. The back detail made the dress special. There is a slit in the back that goes up a ways, so the biker short style shapewear I had couldn't be worn; I went and bought a legless one. It didn't ride up, no tugging or repositioning during the night. I would rent this dress again.","October 7, 2017","True to Size"

It is also made from that nice material that doesn't show all the lumps and bumps. And a gorgeous open back so you can be a little scandalous.","May 11, 2018","Party"

Also, the lace was a bit irritating but nothing horrible! If you do rent this dress I highly recommend ironing out the skirt as it is pretty stiff and sometimes doesnt lay how you'd like it to.

The 8 fit perfectly and I didn't even try on the back up 10. I rented this dress for Christmas Day with my very classy in-laws. The dress is very sophisticated and but also fun. Received lots of compliments. Could not wear a bra with this dress so if you are self conscious about that, this isn't the dress for you. The criss-cross back is lovely! The only reason why I rated this a 4 instead of a 5 is because the bottom of the dress billows in an odd way. It still works and is very beautiful, just an odd gathering at the hem in the front, which I did read about in other reviews. Overall I am very happy with this rental and I will continue to be a RTR customer! (This was my 2nd RTR experience and I just went Pro!)","December 28, 2017","Party"

The thickness of the fabric was perfect to feel covered in the absence of a bra, and the back is wide open. The arm holes were a tad tight at times but I was able to make adjustments and it didn't end up being too irritating overall. The wide shaping band at the bottom of the shirt was a bit wonky when I first received the dress but I bent and worked it flat. Also, some lace was detaching on the front of my dress but not enough that anyone would have noticed, so I ignored it and danced away!","December 21, 2017","True to Size"

My only issue with the dress was that the mid section (right about where my rib cage was) was extremely tight, in the 4, but everywhere else fit perfectly or was even a little big. If you have a small chest, the front area might be a bit ""baggy"", but because of the material and texture, you really can't tell!","December 13, 2017","Formal Affair"

Back detail got a ton of compliments as well as people loved the whole dress. I am small chested and was worried this would look very oversized on me but actually it was comfortable braless and looked great. The band around the bottom was slightly misshapen but I am not picky enough for that to matter. Pockets were great!

Fit true to size at the waist and in the torso but it was a little too long for me, which isn't uncommon for me at 5'.

I loved the color- I don't normally choose red so this was out of my box. The dress fit true to size I'm just under 6 foot and it wasnt too short for me which was really nice. Loved that it had pockets too! I had my phone in my pocket all night and the way the skirt flared out you couldn't even tell. The only reason this dress got one less star is because the hem didn't lay perfectly flat when I got it and I had to press it to get it to look better. Also the top part was pretty big in the bust and I'm on the smaller side up top so I went to target and got a push up stick on bra (since there's an open back) and it worked great!

This dress was a showstopper with its classic shape and feminine lace details. I loved the open back, which made it a little more interesting. The fit was true to size, and I didn't wear a bra. I have a small chest, but the material was thick, so I don't think a bra is necessary even with a larger bust size. Otherwise a backless bra would be the way to go.

I have rented it on three previous occasions. I've worn it to a friend's wedding, anniversary date night, and a Broadway show. The skirt is full and flirty. The pockets are the right size and depth to hold a small wallet/coin purse in one and my cell phone/lip gloss in the other. There is enough structure in the bodice that I can wear the dress without a bra! As a full busted woman, I love that the top is not solid and has some sheer lace to keep the sexy without being over the top. I have never been self conscious about showing too much in this dress. The back is gorgeous and very sexy. I can't wait to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner in January!","September 17, 2017","True to Size"

The cape was a beautiful touch but it is split down the middle, which wasn't really obvious from the photo on the model. Underneath the cape, there is a band that snaps in and makes it so you can wear a regular bra. The weight of the cape and sleeves wanted to pull the shoulder of the dress down a little bit.

I don't think I would have been comfortable in a small in other areas, but the back strap to hide your bra kept sagging and showing it anyway. The back of the bottom where the zipper is would also sag down and show the top of my spanx. I decided it was worth keeping the spanx on anyway :) It was a fun color for a September wedding and was perfect for the temperature.","October 24, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BC133","Anne","Great color and definitely a different look.","This dress looks great, if you walk around with your hand on your hip or in your pocket. However, the cape sleeve tends to look droopy, hangy, sloppy, etc. if you're in any other pose. The waistband was also a little awkward for me, hitting higher than my natural waist but lower than just under my chest... I felt like it was either making my top half look too long or accentuating all of the hors d'oeuvres I'd eaten! Great concept but didn't execute well on me!","October 17, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BC133","Emily","Made me feel like dancing all night!","I rented this for a work dinner in Las Vegas and out to a Cirque du Soleil show after. I wasn't disappointed, but definitely wished I had ordered a size down. The waist and top were at least a size too large on me, so I felt like I was swimming a bit in this. I did use some safety pins to get it to fit alright, and overall I loved the rental! I could wear a normal bra, thanks to the strap across the back. The cape also kept it from feeling too risque for a work event, since it mostly covered the open back, but I could just as easily have worn this on a date or somewhere else. The fabric is light and airy, and you will need a bra of some sort with it. It also hit me just past my knees (I'm a little over 5'9""), so it's a great dress for the taller ladies but it might be something to avoid if you're on the short side. The color is definitely bold, and you do stand out (I got pulled up to be a part of the Cirque du Soleil show we attended while wearing this!). I loved this rental, will likely rent again in a smaller size, and would highly recommend trying it!","October 17, 2018","Large"

I ordered it to wear to a Father's Day brunch. It got the job done, but was my least favorite rental so far. Due to the nature of the fabric the pockets are not practical - you wouldn't actually be able to use them to hold anything and even when empty they show. Also, the snap strap that goes across the back came undone on one side almost every time I moved. The attached cape was a nice idea but all that extra fabric made it difficult to navigate a buffet and eat while wearing it and had the effect of making you look larger than you are in photos and when standing in certain positions.","July 13, 2018","Large"

Based on other reviews, I pinned the strap to the dress, just to be sure it didn't pop open. This was a lot of fun to dance it.

The color is a beautiful deep orange/coral (not quite as coral as my photo suggests, but deeper than the RTR model photo). The elastic helped ensure a nice fit on the waist. My only challenge was with the back - it's open with a bar of fabric that snaps across. It's supposed to cover your bra band, but it did not fall quite right since the top runs large. Safety pins would have fixed the problem, but I didn't have any on hand at the hotel.

I'm short and petite, so I worried about the proportions, but it was almost perfect. It did run large- I'm usually a solid XS/2, but this in an XXS would have been even better. There's a back strap that I assume is supposed to cover a bra, but it fell a good three inches below where a bra would fall (on me, at least). This dress needs a bra because the fabric is thin and there's no support, so you may have to do as I did and buy an adhesive one.

On the downside, in group pictures I looked like I was wearing a circus tent! Definitely need to be strategic in the way that you stand and hold the dress to avoid this.

There is a strap across the open back that is meant to hide a bra strap, but it was so big across by back that I had to pin it to my bra strap. Once pinned. It was perfect. Felt so chic in this!

It was lightweight so I didn't feel too hot. And I got a lot of compliments!!! The lace and the keyhole detail really make this romper unique. It comes with straps but I just tucked those in to give it an off the shoulder look. I actually ordered a M (which is what I usually wear in rompers) but when I tried it on it was huge!

Running small with no stretch, I recommend wearing a size up for your primary size. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works best for A-C cup. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this romper so you should wear a strapless bra, nubra or no bra due to the cut. At 5'0"", the length hit mid-thigh length on me. This was a cute, light romper great to wear for vacation or brunches. If you are curvier, I would recommend sizing up. Pair with strappy heels or sandals to complete your outfit!","April 29, 2018","Large"

It goes down to my mid-thigh, which is amazing, as most rompers end up being too short on me. It's a very cute, classic summer style.

Thankfully, it was exactly what I needed!! I was surprised that the 6 fit as nicely as it did (even with a little room to spare) but it was incredibly comfortable to wear all night. The fabric is thicker with just a tiny bit of stretch, and overall it's very forgiving. I wore basic shapewear underneath, but I think it would have looked fabulous no matter what. There is a LOT of cleavage, but I like to show the ladies off and had fun with it. I was able to wear a deep-v bra, and the dress even had these amazing little snaps hidden under the shoulder straps to keep the bra and dress straps together. I wore the dress to a February wedding, and paired it with a nice tan wool wrap. It hit just below the knee for me, and looked fantastic with a simple set of nude heels and a necklace. Would absolutely rent again and would love to be able to buy this dress! I'm 5'3"", about 150 pounds as of that wedding, with a 32DDD.","February 5, 2020","Large"

Only 4 stars because the cut in the cleavage is quite low and the straps are set a bit wide on the shoulders, so I felt like I had to monitor the top a bit all night.

Based on the other reviews stating that this dress runs large, I planned to order a size 8 for my backup dress. However, the size 8s were out of stock, so I went with a size 6. The 6 is what ended up fitting. The only problem I had was that the lining in the chest area kept creeping up and out of the neckline so I had to readjust it periodically. I think that was probably due to having a larger bust in a smaller dress. Perhaps a size 8 would have been perfect.

I also liked that it emphasized my curves without being indecent. The lines are clean and simple, so it is easy to jazz it up with accessories. I was also impressed with how comfortable it was.

The material was very thick & stretchy - I felt like it was holding everything in place but still allowed me to move & breath comfortably. The front is a bit low so be prepared to have lots of cleavage & if you have a smaller bust I'm not sure this would work with your body type or if you had a smaller waist. Lots of bonus points for being able to wear a regular bra with this dress. At 5'1 the dress was just a tad longer than I would have preferred but overall was fine. I'm not sure I would rent this not pregnant as the cut may not work with my normal frame but depending on your body type I think this dress could be very flattering. It's a very dark navy color and simple/classic. Very happy I read the reviews & rented this style.

This size 8 was perfect and allowed me to wear a column dress which I loved. The collar has it's own jewelry so all I needed was earrings and a bracelet to accessorize.

I have a large bust, carry my weight around the middle (#apple), yet am short and petite. This dress did not gape under the arms, had plenty enough room in the bust (but not so much it looked baggy; I think the pleats in the twist help with that), and was an appropriate length. I did find it a little snug in the waist. I had to wear spanx in order for the seam not to show in the middle of the dress. One other thing to note is that there is no slit in the skirt, so getting in and out of the car was a bit difficult. All in all, I was very pleased with this dress and got lots of compliments!","October 23, 2018","Wedding"

Also, the beading is a chrome charcoal grey color. While it wasn't a huge deal, I would have chosen a silver shoe had I been able to tell ahead of time. Overall, a good experience.

I had to use a ribbon and tie them together in the back. And I bought higher shoes then I was originally planning to wear so the sides wouldn't drag on the ground. Again I am 5'1 so that is often my life. I wore and 8 which is the medium and I wish I would of done medium and small rather then my backup being large because maybe the straps would of been a bit better.

Definitely recommend wearing underwear/bra that's not bulky to keep the dress looking smooth. I'm 4'11 and the length of this dress was good enough (possibly an inch shorter would have been ideal but wearing heels helped). I especially like this dress because of the sleeves to keep me warm.

I'm sort of medium in that area so if my boobs were any smaller it might have stiffly moved around in a weird way instead of just settling over them. Only reason I'll give it 4 stars. Otherwise, it was beautiful, the material was thick and very well made, and I liked the waist and how the bottom pleats flared out.

I wanted to order the XS as my backup but it was unavailable. The S was a tad large in the waist so I do wonder if the XS would've fit a little better.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/STS26","Amanda","Almost Perfection","I wore this dress for one of my band's gigs. We were shooting video that night and I wanted to kick it up a notch. This dress is hands down gorgeous! The shape and colors of the dress are incredibly flattering. I received compliments all night from both men and women. The reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars is because the zippers on both dresses were completely impossible. I couldn't even zip down the dress on the size 4 to take it off of the hanger. I had an easier time with the size 6, but it wouldn't go all the way up. And it wasn't because it didn't fit! At one point my boyfriend had taken out a pair of pliers to try and get a better grip on the zipper. It still wouldn't budge! We ended up safety pinning the dress shut at the top. It was kind of a nightmare, but the dress was killing, and therefore worth it! This dress runs a bit on the small size, and given the fiasco I had with both zippers, I would highly recommend sizing up for your backup. I'm a 34A and didn't wear a bra. None was needed. The fabric was thick enough that I never worried about my girls! If you have patience and/or feel like pressing your luck, rent this dress!","September 19, 2018","Other"

Having such a low cut you can't wear a bra.

The invisible zipper and I had some words, though. Couldn't get it zipped. Took the dress off. STILL couldn't get it zipped. Enlisted a friend. No dice. Eventually I found that if I put the dress on sideways, I could zip it and then fold in my arms and boobs. Turned out fine once I learned the trick, lol.","June 13, 2018","Formal Affair"

It was thick material so a bra wasn't needed). I think I would have felt more at ease if I would have bought some fashion tape to keep the dress secured.

This dress took two friends to get the zipper up (and some help from vaseline), and the zipper was hard to zip without even having the dress on. Dress has no stretch and is really tight at the waist. Needed a ton of dress tape to keep the upper part in place, and had to keep my shoulders back and watch how I moved all night. Because the waist is very fixed, there's not much to be done about the shoulder straps. They stayed on for the most part but easily slid off if I moved the wrong way.

This dress left plenty of room for my hips and flattered the waist, but the straps wanted to fall off even though I'm not unually tall, and the boning in the chest area seemed bent and wanted to turn the bra part out. I ended up taping the dress to my boobs and it stayed put after that. The material is pretty thick so it's good for a winter event, and there's no need for a bra because of how thick it is! This is overall a very flattering dress but you should definitely err on the small side and have fashion tape ready.","December 8, 2017","Party"

Cons: Runs a little large, I was so glad I got a small as a backup for the medium! I could have probably gone with extra small. Little bit large in the chest area - making it hard to find a bra that works with the dress without showing. You might need dress tape to keep everything together.

It was comfortable dancing and moving throughout the night and my boyfriend loved it! This dress enhances the waist and makes legs go for days ;) The only thing was the right strap fell down a few times throughout the night and the zipper was a little hard to zip up at the top but I was able to do it alone.

The back sheer black section dipped a little too low to wear a regular strapless bra with this. The bright red color really popped and got a lot of compliments. I was worried it would look like I was wearing a table-cloth but the fabric was great in person. Also, the bit of pleats in the top waist section gave it a nice fullness and a silky red nylon liner kept it from feeling itchy. I would rent again and recommend it to anyone!","December 10, 2018","True to Size"

Loved having pockets and not needing to worry about a purse.","I have a long torso and this dress gave me a lovely waist. I normally wear between a 14 and a 16. Ordered the 16 and 20 after reading reviews. I could get the 16 on but the 20 had room for me to breathe and not feel unable to sit. Felt beautiful and recieved many compliments!","December 9, 2018","Small"

The dress is perfectly serviceable but I didn't feel over the moon about it. I wish the 4 had been available for a more fitted look. I'm 5' 2 1/2"" and wore 3-inch heels and it hit right at tea length and if I owned this dress I'd have it hemmed higher. The circle skirt would have been too tough to carry a decent looking taped hem on, I think. Overall, it's a yes but was sort of a forgettable one.","December 8, 2018","True to Size"

The dress fit her like a glove and is modest, yet splashy. She opted for conservative hair and makeup with a bright red lip to bring out the Spanish vibe she felt as soon as she pulled it out of the bag. A real 10/10!","October 15, 2018","Party"

No worries of poking out anywhere, things slipping... This was actually my back-up dress and I put it on MINUTES before walking out the door when I realized my very low cut first choice was going to make me self conscious all night long and worried that I'd have a wardrobe malfunction. In this dress I felt comfortable and pretty and I loved that I could keep my cell phone in my pocket in case my babysitter texted me or I needed a cute pic of the night. I wore it with no bra and the top fits snugly enough that it worked perfect. The sheer back would make most bras not work very well.","March 4, 2018","True to Size"

The dress was just tight enough (but not uncomfortable) that I put little adhesive cups in too give me a little lift and it worked out wonderfully.

I usually wear a 10 because I don't prefer things to be tight, but this was looser so I could've gone with an 8. I'd rent it again it was beautiful.","October 6, 2017","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CN89","RTR Customer","I ordered a different dress for an evening fundraiser, and I received this dress instead.","The chest area was a bit big, which is not surprising because I am small-chested. Also, the sheer section in back dips low, so a low-back strapless bra is needed if worn. However, the mid-section fit well, and there was no problem with the hip area because the skirt flares out. I pinned the sides, which helped the dress fit better around the chest. Overall, I really liked wearing this dress. The stiffer fabric helps to maintain the flare of the skirt, and the print is eye-catching. Also, the dress has pockets, which come in handy. Five stars for this dress, and I would rent it again.","September 28, 2017","True to Size"

It was age appropriate, but it would look lovely on all ages. The sheer black mesh top made wearing a bra difficult, but the front paneling was sufficient to go braless. The top portion of the dress is very fitted, and the waist is fitted. Pear shaped women would love this dress, because it does not emphasize the hips. It is slimming and gorgeous!","June 1, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CN89","Courtney","Great color and comfy to wear!","Got many compliments on the style and color. Wore this for a ""derby day"" at Pimlico Race Course. The material is light which was great for a 92 degree day. The dress did not stick to me at all, granted I had some spanx on--but I didn't feel hot and uncomfortable wearing it. I recommend getting a good strapless bra to wear with it if you're blessed up top like me. Although the back is see through, I was able to hike the top red part of the dress up slightly to meet the bottom of my strapless bra, and it looked like it was apart of the dress. The dress runs a little snug around the ribs but not enough to not wear but I also recommend going with the bigger size of what you normally wear. It's a great lower tummy hider too! I will definitely wear this dress again!!!","May 20, 2017","Party"

It was fine for standing up, but trying to sit or bend over was nearly impossible because my booty was sucked in tight! It was also tight in the collar.

I rented another dress as my primary dress for a friend's July wedding but really loved this one. I was nervous to rent it because it had so few reviews at the time, but when I saw a promo to rent a third dress for $35, I decided to give this one a shot and I'm so glad I did. The fabric is stunning and the color is very rich - photos don't really do it justice. I have a small waist and wide hips so I ordered the 18 even though I wear a 16 normally. It really accentuated my waist and the pleats were very flattering. The top wear the sleeves connect to the dress was a little big, but I was still very happy with the fit and because it flares out, there was no need for spanx! I highly recommend this dress for anyone with an hourglass or even pear shape. Ordering one size up is probably a good idea too.","August 20, 2016","Wedding"

The fit was stunning!","I generally wear an 8 or a 10 but per the recommendation I ordered a 10 with a 12 as a back up. My body type is definitely not thin but to small to be fat... round it all of with the fact I am short (4'11), busty, with a booty. I am a 43 G, so the dress was a lil tight in the bust area but that's expected with all my clothes so I wasn't uncomfortable. I could zip up the 10 but since I order this dress for a religious convention where I would be sitting down for 8hrs , getting in and out of a van and walking around, and taking pictures, the 10 was a bit too tight, so I went with the 12 which gave me a lil more wiggle room. The color is beautiful, the embroidered flowers are a nice touch. I felt beautiful and received a lot of compliments. The dress is a classy fit yet stunning. I recommend a size up to have some breathing room if you will be sitting down, but overall a great dress for a special event without being overly formal.","August 17, 2016","Small"

However, I was disappointed at the size when it arrived. The band at the waist had no stretch and bunched up, making my torso look shorter than it really is. It was extremely difficult to zip, and nearly impossible to get into without someone there to help (the zipper starts really low and goes up to the neck of the dress). The arms were also tight, and I couldn't feel when my bra straps kept slipping. Overall, I received compliments on the dress but would not re-order.","July 9, 2019","Other"

I was concerned it wasn't going to fit the first time I tried it on because it just wasn't shutting, but after a few hands helping out the zipper eventually went up.

It's a little disappointing, as it was too late to do anything about it by the time I noticed. The dress received dozens of compliments and I felt great in it. It was a little snug, so if you are on the fence about sizing, I'd recommend a size up. The color is gorgeous. A perfect berry red. It's sophisticated and just enough to be ""the woman in red,"" without it being over-the-top. The peplum is a real hit-or-miss. I can see why it wouldn't work on other women. And, if I'm honest, the dress would have been much more flattering had the peplum been about an inch and a half lower on my torso. So, it really depends on your measurements. If it hit ""just right,"" I can see how it would be extremely flattering.","January 15, 2018","Small"

The best feature of the dress were the pockets, which became life-savers throughout the day/evening. The dress is a bit long for someone shorter in stature, so be cognizant of that. Additionally, depending on how limber you are, you may need assistance zipping it up completely. The dress is textured and NOT quite as white as it appears in photos. There is a lining, which makes the dress somewhat warm depending on the outside temperature. The pinks are more coral than pink and I would consider the p purple to be more plum.

The dress itself had some pulls but was perfect for the mountaintop wedding. Not to heavy in the late summer heat. A bit snug in the top but I am a 34 DD so that's fairly normal.

I wore it to the church ceremony for my brothers wedding and highly recommend it. Im usually a 6 but wore a 4 because when I wear a-line styles I don't like when the skirt has a ton of extra fabric just for my chest because it's less flattering on my bottom half. I could've used a 6 for my D chest but no one noticed and I only was uncomfortable after 7 hours of wear. For all those hourglass ladies with a bottom and D-ish size chests, I'd say go a size down for sure! Way more flattering. Got compliments all day!","June 28, 2018","Party"

I was disappointed in the condition of the dress though - there is beautiful lace detail throughout and the dress had quite noticeable pulls throughout.

I am a true size 10 in dresses (bust is 34D/34DD) and it wasn't even CLOSE to zipping up top. We are talking a solid inch to go. The neck piece hooked fine, but there was no chance of zipping past the waist. Also, be wary of the pleats. I have curves and the pleats opened up on me weird.

Just make sure you get a size that will let you breathe! Also the dress is a little low cut, so be aware of that.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AP24","Lisa","Beautiful color and cut - very flattering!","I rented this for a fun night out in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. I wore it to a nice dinner, then walked around the Quarter and went to a parade. I got tons of compliments. The cut is super flattering and I was able to wear a regular bra with it. The straps were a little loose, but only when I slouched, so I just had to have good posture all night. LOL! The waist was very fitted and there is no give, so keep that in mind when ordering a size. I current weigh 135. My measurements are 35, 27, 37 and I wear a 32 D or C. I wore the size 4 and it fit great. I didn't want to send this dress back!","March 3, 2019","Date"

It was a cute dress, but extremely low cut. The material is also very heavy just FYI. The waist has no give so kind of 50/50 if it will fit there! I thought it ran a bit large, but I'm also petite so that may have played into it.","January 11, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AP24","RTR Customer","Awesome Dress!","Was very happy with my rental choice! The neckline fell much deeper than I expected, as the dress doesn't fall so low on the model, but I assume thats because I'm rather short (5'3"") with a small torso. My boyfriend, however, appreciated that aspect of the dress so I'm still very pleased, haha. Otherwise it was super comfortable and the lower half of the dress spun really well and made it fun to dance in! I usually wear a 2 or a 4, but had to go with a 0 on this one so I recommend sizing down. Also, this could be because I have small shoulders and am a B cup, but the straps didn't fit well even though the ribcage did. I still loved how it looked despite it being a bit big / bunched up on top though, just something to keep in mind. Overall, very pretty, fun dress; I'm very happy I chose it!! Would recommend","November 10, 2018","Party"

The skirt was perfect for dancing and was quite the show-stopper! Word to the wise: come prepare with cups or no bra if you want the neckline as is. It plunged pretty deeply and I had trouble finding a bra where the ribbon between cups DIDN'T show. Ultimately, went without which was worked well, straps kept everything where it needed to be but my chest runs on the small size. Also, the fabric is not lined up top so if you are going braless, and it's going to be chilly....be prepared. All in all, lovely for a fall wedding! ALSO the zipper in the back is functional and goes all the way to the base of the skirt. You've been warned.","October 31, 2018","Wedding"

I didn't fill out the top of the dress, it was a little baggy, like my torso was too short. The back zipper unzips completely and the waist fits very snug. Normally wear a size 10 but I wore the size 12. The bottom of dress was full and the length not too short. Overall it worked out great.","October 14, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AP24","Meredith","So cute, but requires tape if you have small boobs!","This dress is adorable and the fabric is so comfortable - I got tons of compliments and the zipper detail all the way down the back looks so cool in person. I have a smaller chest (34B) and I felt like it would have been easier to wear for someone with bigger boobs. I ended up wearing sticky inserts sort of offset to the side so they wouldn't be seen in the plunging neckline and that was fine if I didn't dance too hard, but if you're really small chested this may not be the dress for you.","October 9, 2018","Wedding"

I definitely couldn't move very fast even though I would say I'm good at walking in stiletto heels. It was also difficult to use the bathroom while wearing this dress.

If the dress had been any tighter in my chest it would not have been comfy.","August 30, 2017","Vacation"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS38","RTR Customer","Love the color!","Loved the color of the dress! I would definitely recommend ordering your true size, plus a size up. My true size is a 10, however the waist line runs a bit a small and I had to go up a size. Many reviews will say that it gapes open at the top, and since I had to go up a size I experienced a lot of gaping when I sat down with the dress on. However, it's definitely still a beautiful dress to have on!","July 13, 2017","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS38","Mary virginia","Lovely color, odd fit","I rented this dress for my brother's wedding. The color, the fabric, and the formally were perfect for the event. The fit, however, was bizarre. The skirt is a bubble skirt, and the waist was very fitted. The hem of the skirt was so confining that getting in and out of the car gracefully was nearly impossible. It wasn't the best silhouette on my curvy frame, but it wasn't awful. The issue came from the fit on the bodice. I am very, very busty. The back of the dress pulled so tightly from armpit to armpit that it was almost painful. The top of the back of the bodice was so loose that it gapped significantly. If I could have tailored it, I could have put two darts in and cut off about 2-3 inches of fabric: that's how large the gap was! The neckline was so deeply cut that had there been more than close friends at the wedding, I would have been mortified with the amount of cleavage. The bodice was also so fitted in the front that my chest was smushed down. I'm not sure who this dress is designed for, but it isn't a curvy woman with an hour-glass figure.","January 16, 2017","Wedding"

I added this dress to an existing order, so only got one size. I normally wear an 8, 10 or 12 in dresses, depending on the designer and style. Based on the reviews I went with a 12 to be on the safe side. It was big in the top, and the full skirt was very forgiving in the waist/hips, so I definitely could have gone with a 10. But it still looked great and I got lots of compliments. The length was great, right above my knees since I'm 5'2"", but careful when you bend down/over, it gets real short, real fast! ;) The style was very me, so with that on top of the fit, it was really comfortable to wear all night. Once upon a time the dress did have the little snaps to hold bra straps in place, but both on my dress were broken, so I wore a strapless bra, otherwise straps would have been showing anytime I moved. Overall, I would totally get this dress again in the next size down. Lots you can do for styling, I chose a big multi-strand pearl necklace, and a boa, because that's what you do at your bachelorette weekend, right? Apologies for the mediocre photo, I forgot to get a full length one! :)","August 18, 2016","True to Size"

I'm a 14, so my choices felt a bit limited (and I recently gained a little weight, so I was feeling down about that). So, I tried on whatever I found in my size, just to see. For that reason only did I pull it off the rack. What a fun surprise! This dress is a little more fashion-forward than I usually go for, and I worried that the side ruffles would accentuate my curves in the wrong way. But, it was SO CUTE! I'm also on the short side, but the dress hit me mid-thigh--perfect! If you are taller, it's probably more mini-length. There's also just enough stretch to move with you and make it a super-comfy wear. I didn't want to send it back!","September 24, 2016","Date"

Sleeves were long, and both the waist and hip areas seemed to run a bit wide. The skirt section felt needlessly volumtious, and the slight high/low hemline just emphsized that fact.

Running a bit small, we recommend going one size up for backup. With room in the bust this dress is great for all cup sizes. The midsection is fitted to show off your curves, but it is still comfortable. If you’re curvier, you may want to consider sizing up due to the fitted hip area. One thing that I love about this dress is the off the shoulder feature; however that means you would have to wear a NuBra or strapless bra for this look. The long sleeve and off the shoulder feature make this dress super flattering. This dress is perfect for weddings and holidays.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RZ87","Rakiya","Stylist Review","I love this trendy dress by Rachel Zoe! Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. This dress is tight (very firmly and closely fitted). It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra or no bra since there is an open back. At 5’6”, the length hit knee length on me. The piece is ideal for a formal affair or cocktail occasion. It's fun and flirty, but also mature and means business. The dress is a statement enough, so don't over accessorize.","August 10, 2018","True to Size"

I thought it ran a tad big - the sleeves were too long for me, so the elbow slits hit me more below the elbow, and the sleeve cuffs were sort of awkward (but I am short, so this is probably not a problem if you're 5'4 - 5'8). The rest of the dress was comfortable - not tight, not overly loose. I'd say it runs a bit large, in that I was able to put it on without unzipping the lower back part. The length is good, I don't like dresses to run too long since I'm short, and this one hit well above the knee (without being super short, either).","October 10, 2016","Large"

This was my first RTR and it was excellent! The dress was so comfortable, you can wear a normal bra with it, and the fabric is forgiving. I loved the cut out. I felt like it gave the dress some flare without showing too much skin. I typically run between a 10-12 so I got both sizes and ended up in the 12. The 10 fit well but the 12 was just more comfortable. I'm also always weary of shorter dresses ending up being too short as I'm tall but this one was the perfect length on me. Also, the color is hard to photograph but this picture was the most accurate. It's a dark hunter green but can appear dark teal in photos or even black.

I typically have to go up a size for most of my dresses, but this one fit true to size with the 10. I didn't even try on the 12. A bit longer than I anticipated, hitting a few inches above the knees, but it didn't bother me like it usually might because the top had so much interest. I wore a normal black demi bra with no issues - you couldn't see it really. It hid my trouble area (midsection) very well and the fabric was thicker but I think would work well for any time of the year.

I could have worn either size, but went with the 4 as the top fit a little snugger and looked better without a bra.

The waist and length were great however. The lining on a size 8 was still way too tight (the dress material is stretchy but the liner is not), and finally a size 10 fit. It was roomy in the waist but the length was alright and overall didn't look too big. That being said, I loved this dress!

The dress is a little short when you sit down, but I always wear spanx under for when I am dancing, so it did not bother me that much.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW156","Nicole","Bump friendly - not chest friendly","Rented this for a wedding at 20 weeks pregnant. I was excited to see RTR now has ""bump friendly"" options, and this was one that was suggested. I was an 8-10 pre-pregnancy, but based on reviews that the chest was tight, I rented a 12 with the 14 as my backup - VERY glad I did this! The 12 would have been the perfect fit - slightly hugging the hips, showing off the bump - but the chest was ever so slightly too snug. My boobs have grown a little bit, but I'm still in my pre-pregnancy bras (34D). The 12 was tight enough in the chest and armpits that I wouldn't be comfortable. The 14 fit my chest and unfortunately a little big and boxy for my body - but for anyone who's pregnant, you know that you'll often choose comfort over style =) In the end, I was comfortable, loved the color, and felt very cute and confident with my 20 week bump. Great rental for the bump, but definitely size up for the chest!","September 7, 2016","Small"

The ruffle is a fun little detail and the color is stunning, more of a deeper pink than in the picture though I would say. I paired it with nude heels, a Lauren Merkin clutch, and Alexis Bittar drop earrings and I got so many compliments, which, you know, always feels good. Only complaint I have is that the 4 had a dark stain on the ruffle so had that one fit me better, I would have been kind of upset. Would definitely rent again!","July 26, 2016","True to Size"

The fabric has a nice distressed finish to it, and it's grooved fabric almost so it look really high quality and unique. The cut up top could be problematic for some. It's a very defined boob area, so if you run small or large in that department it might be a tricky fit. I found that the boob area fit decently for me (dd) but it was borderline. Great option for everyday if you're looking for something unique. Was flattering, featured a lot of color, the ruffles were fun and features a classy amount of cleavage.","July 14, 2018","True to Size"

I should have ordered a 12 or 14 based on how baggy this was on me. But it is a BEAUTIFUL dress. Very light and easy. I give 3 stars for now because of the fit.

It fit like a glove and went perfectly with the flat shoes she had instructed us to wear (I am 5 ft 5 in for reference). The dress is definitely clingy, especially across the middle, but fit very well. It also has a super deep v-neck, making a bra nearly impossible.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSC4","Stephanie","I wore this dress for an Indian-Jewish fusion wedding where I needed a plum/eggplant purple dress.","The dress has quite a lot of stretch, which was great. I had to go down a size, due to the stretch and my body shape. The Regular length worked really well for my 4 inch heels - you could see the shoes but it wasn't too much. Overall, I really liked this dress; however, there were some problems I had that I think other people need to keep in mind when they're deciding on this dress: 1) even though there's a lot of stretch, it's not great for people with butts/hips. It fit fine and I felt pretty but, being very pear-shaped, the back didn't sit flat above my butt, which I would have preferred. 2) the shoulders were for a slightly longer-torsoed individual. I have this problem a lot being 5'4"" but it's always slightly frustrating. 3) Boobage! I didn't feel comfortable not wearing a bra with this dress, but because of #2, I had to get a deep-v strapless bra that I could then use band extenders with to bring the back of the bra down a little to not show. The way the lace is, though, I could wear a clear bra strap, halter-style. 4) As other reviews have mentioned, the lace is a little scratchy. Now that I have said ALL that, I did really like this dress. I felt beautiful. I received a lot of compliments. There was a lot of stretch to move and dance and sit - it was surprisingly comfortable.","May 16, 2018","Large"

I wore the long and the front of the dress was angled just enough that a cute pair of shoes made the length work. Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with how this dress looked and made me feel!

I normally wear an 8 but never know how nice dresses run, so I was nervous about getting the right size. The 8R worked perfectly! I did wear spanx to help smooth everything out. At first I thought the top was too loose but I realized I didn't have all the claps done up the back. After that, it fit perfectly!

I don't normally like bell sleeves, but it made the dress just a little bohemian in my opinion, and I felt wonderful in it.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/EJ88","Jodi","Cute and comfortable","Thanks to the intel from other reviews I got this in medium and large - and as expected, I ended up wearing the medium dress with the large slip under it – and even then the slip was skintight. The medium dress fit perfectly - not too tight or too loose - and looked great . the large dress was just too big and shapeless, but the medium slip was more like an XS. I wore this to a dinner party so I spent most of the evening sitting down but every time I stood up I had to pull the slip down because it would keep creep ing up almost up to my waist. If I ever rent this again I'm probably going to wear my own slip underneath to avoid these problems. In any case it was comfortable and fancy without being too formal - the bell sleeves are 3/4, so I didn't have to worry about them dragging or getting caught in things. Overall a good choice - I just don't know what is up with the slip sizing.","February 21, 2018","Party"

You can wear a real bra with it, which is a big plus because I find strapless bras to be super uncomfortable. This dress is an amazing thick material, and shows off a sexy amount of cleavage.

I'm pretty short and this dress was a bit short on me...but I had planned to wear it with black tights so it was totally fine!

I can't say enough good things about this dress. It was so comfortable and easy to wear. The cut is slimming. The pattern is gorgeous in person. I received so many compliments on it. Cynthia Rowley really knows how to make great clothes for women! I will add that it's a little short. My tall friend said she probably wouldn't be able to wear it.","December 12, 2018","True to Size"

The event was a formal gala, and I was a little worried about the length, but on me (5'2"") it hit my knees, which was PERFECT. Love the dark purple and the gold. This was my first RTR experience and it absolutely delivered. Can't wait to rent the runway again!","November 5, 2018","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR99","RTR Customer","Perfect for homecoming !!","I rented this for my homecoming, it was the perfect color and fit. It was a bit snug around my waist and chest which fit well with my body shape, but I did get a size down because it wasn't available in my usual size- which ended up working out anyway. Customer service was so helpful. I am 5'7"" , around 125 pounds with 34B chest and a 0 fit me well.","October 31, 2018","Party"

I received a ton of compliments on how flattering the dress was and how great the quality of it was. The colors were also gorgeous for a fall wedding. The only issues I had with this dress was that it was a bit short and the top area was a little loose. If you have a smaller bust, it may be a little big in that area, especially if the straps are a little big. It was also kind of short, and I am 5'2"". So, if you're taller than that, definitely keep that in mind. Otherwise, I loved the fit and flare of this dress, it was perfect!","October 26, 2018","True to Size"

The back was slightly longer which was nice! Pockets were a great plus! The thicker material was great for an 80 degree day that turned chilly in the evening. I loved the purple and gold colors of this dress for a late summer/early fall wedding. I wore my usual size 2, but it was right in the chest/rib cage. No bra made it more spacious but I would order a size up for your backup.","September 2, 2018","Wedding"

The material is on the thicker side, so I probably wouldn't want to rent it in the summertime for an outdoor wedding. The colors are beautiful -- gold jewellery and black shoes pair well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the dress seems a tad short in the back. Careful when bending down!","May 13, 2018","True to Size"

I expected the dress to show some cleavage and it did! I was able to wear a normal bra with it, which made me happy. Oh, and it has pockets which also made me happy! However, I was a little uncomfortable with how short it was. I'm only 5'4"" and I was almost sitting on my bare buns when I sat down. Given how much cleavage I was showing, I would've preferred it to be a *little* longer. I doubt I would rent again.","March 20, 2018","Other"

The fabric is so unique and pretty and the lace is such a great touch. The fit was great too and held my stomach in well. It was the perfect balance between low but not too low and short but not too short. Im 5'7"" and wore 3in heels and it was the perfect length. I hope I can rent this dress again! It was one of my favorites!","January 31, 2018","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CR99","Rachel","Love the color!","I rented this for a semi-formal wedding and received a lot of compliments! The color and pattern were unique and stood out against the other dresses. I didn't feel that the length was too short; however, I have a larger chest and the dress showed a bit more cleavage than I normally would. With that said, it was a good back up dress and worked for the occasion. I'd recommend it!","November 19, 2017","Wedding"

I couldn't wear a bra with it because of the cut, but didn't really need it. The style is so flattering and comfortable. I loved this dress. The color and texture made it a stand out. The pockets were great, but I accidentally left my small wallet with ID, debit card and cash in it in the pocket when I sent it back. I sent an online chat to RTR and a week later my wallet (with everything inside) showed up at my house via UPS at no charge to me.

I have a larger bust compared to my smaller frame, so it's difficult to find dresses that fit well, but this one worked very well! I usually wear a size 4, but the size 6 worked best. I couldn't zip it up with a bra on, but the dress gave me enough support so that I didn't need one. I would definitely recommend this, just make sure to size up!","November 4, 2017","Formal Affair"

At 5'1"" & 115lbs it can be difficult to find dresses that fit my petite frame without drowning me in fabric. The cut was perfect, although the straps could have fit my shoulders a little better. I rented the 2 &4 thinking the 0 would have been too small, but I wish I had sized down than up. The fabric was really thick & felt really nice as the evening got a little colder. I would totally recommend this dress for a fall event as the colors are perfect & it fits great!","October 19, 2017","Wedding"

The material is very thick and stiff, so it was a bit hot in the Louisiana heat. I wore the 6 because the waist band does not stretch and I knew I'd be sitting. It also has pockets which is nice because you can't have a purse when you cross the stage at graduation and it gave me somewhere to put my phone. It is a little short, but so am I and the proportion worked. The top is very structured so you don't need a bra.","October 1, 2017","Other"

As for sizing, I tend to wear 0-4 depending on cut since I have an athletic shape with a small waist and more muscular butt and thighs.

My only less than positive issue was that the dress had no slit. I saw this in other reviews but they said it worked out fine. Well I was a little more active and have a very long stride.

I tried to get my boyfriend to take me on a date before I had to return it, but no such luck : / Order up at LEAST two sizes because it runs small. I have a true hourglass figure and I think this dress is most likely to be the most flattering on that body type. The cutouts hit right at my true waist, so it was very flattering. The back makes it look like a two-piece dress which is so unique and interesting.

The fit and length of the dress is sexy and fun, but conservative enough to fit in for a high end event. I did wear my Spanx- the dress doesn't show lumps but it does show love handles. The chest area is stretchy and amazing for big chested gals. Fits 100% true to size, the large fit my size 14 body well. The colors are nice in person, there is a bit of cleavage that will show and luckily you can wear a regular bra instead of strapless.","July 24, 2018","Party"

I didn't find it too low cut for work. The dress is really pretty with bright colors. It is a perfect length for work, but the asymmetrical design kept it young and a little flirty. I wore it with a blue blazer to make it a bit more professional since I am a lawyer, but removing the jacket, it could definitely be work out after work for drinks.","May 9, 2018","Small"

At first I was afraid it would be too form fitting in the tummy but it turned out to be very flattering (tummy and booty). I paired this with a dark blue jean jacket since it was a little out of my comfort zone for the office. I'm not exceptionally full up top so I wasn't falling out but for someone who has more than a C cup you may find the breast area of the dress a little too revealing. The length is perfect and the flair at the bottom gave just enough flounce, not overwhelming at all. The material is thin but not cheap.

I liked the color and the pattern as I feel maternity wear can get a little bit too sweet. And I liked that this wasn't a giant maxi which also feels inappropriate at this size bump. The main down side is that the comfortable material feels cheap; it doesn't feel like an expensive dress.

The dress shape is really flared out and the fabric helps keep it's shape well. Perfect for wider hips! The open back is just amazing...But be sure to wear a backless bra because the bow will not conceal it.

I am 5'6"" and 135lbs, and I would normally wear a size 4. I ended up wearing a size 8 (size 6 wasn't available) which gave me enough length to be comfortable, and the adjustable tie on the back made it a perfect fit, even without a bra. Other reviews aren't kidding when they say it runs short. I'm not someone who minds showing off a little, but my usual size 4 hardly covered the goods in both the back and the front. I do have a long torso, so it's possible it would be less dramatic on someone with a shorter torso, but I definitely recommend sizing up one or two sizes. The skirt flares out quite a bit which creates a nice narrow waistline and would likely be flattering on most shapes. This dress isn't exactly a showstopper, but it is a great version of the LBD with the added flare of the tie-back. It is very comfortable, with thick, quality fabric, and gave me the freedom to indulge in food and dance all night long. I would definitely recommend.","October 24, 2017","Small"

The material is nice and thick so a bra is not needed which is great because the back is open and a bra would show. I rented this dress as a back up this time and ended up needing it, they only had a 2 which fit great but was a little loose on the sides of the chest, the first time I rented I wore a 0 which fit like a glove.

It is the perfect dress for a party where you actually want to eat! The cut is a little roomy, but it doesn't look potato-sacky b/c it drapes so nicely. The dress is short but not so short that you can't sit down in it. I didn't need to wear spanx b/c of the forgivable cut, but I wish I would have bought a strapless bra to wear with it b/c my black bra straps showed through in the lace in the upper back. It didn't look terrible, but it was a little detail I wish I would have thought of. The blue is a little darker than in the pictures of the model...the dress reads black.

I was disappointed that some of the other, flashier styles I'd rented didn't fit me well. This dress came through! It looks basic in the photos, but it's crazy flattering in person, and it photographs beautifully. It drapes elegantly over the figure. The trapeze shape looks exaggerated in the photos, but in person it's more of an A line. The lace at the neck is lovely, and the subtle flash of color in the lace is very pretty. It's a very comfortable dress, as well, thanks to the material and the shape. All in all a total gem. Feels as comfortable as a nightgown, looks like a formal dress, and makes you look great in photos. Maybe it's not the most trendy or flashy, but I highly recommend!","December 24, 2018","True to Size"

It wound up fitting me differently than the model. It was less A-line/flared and more fitted around the stomach due to the baby, but it was so comfortable and I was still able to wear my normal size. The lining/shell had plenty of give and extra room as well as the outer lace layer. I am 5'8"" and the length was good even with the baby belly in the way. The lace is very soft, not itchy at all.

You can dress it up or down - I wore with flats and also with a block heel (sorry the pics I've uploaded doesn't really show off the dress very well but I didn't get a full length shot). I saw this as a perfect rental because the cutouts are trendy and something that you might be reluctant to invest in because they could be ""out"" next season.

The fit is relatively true to size. Easy to zip on the side with the comfortable ruched waist. It was a bit right across my chest as I'm top heavy and wore a padded strapless bra.

The fabric was loose and needed to be steamed but even then, the lack of structure didn't do my body type any favors. The fabric bunched all around the top and bottom of the elastic waist. The top was too large for my bust size. If you can make a zero-structure cut & fabric work, the one shoulder is pretty and so is the pattern.

There's a snap closure at the top, but for anyone with any cleavage I would say that the placement of the snap is a little matronly. I used some beauty tape instead and it worked really well. The waistband is elastic and the fluttery layer over the shorts are both super forgiving and flattering. I wore this to a night time event in Houston, TX, so it was a little chilly, but the sleeves definitely helped (and I could wear a normal bra so no nippage either).

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF45","RTR Customer","Great dress, but short!","I really liked this dress! Fit was small as others have reviewed. The black lining of the sz 0 fell below the lace, has probably been stretched from people pulling it down, so I wore the 2 which fit fine. I'm short 5'0"", so shorter length was fine for me. The reason I'm giving a 4 is b/c there is no hook/eye closure at top of zipper so it kept coming unzipped!! I had to safety pin it. If I'd worn my hair up, this would have been a deal breaker. Not sure if dress is supposed to have hook/eye and has just been ripped off over time, but neither dress had one.","October 24, 2018","Formal Affair"

Admittedly I'm somewhat tall (5' 7""), but whew, this was approaching indecent if I shifted from straight upright which was a bit of a bummer at a new years eve event. Should have worn black tights with it! The lace sleeves were also somewhat stiff, so it limited mobility a bit. However, to the good--the fabric was beautiful!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DVF45","Iris","I wasn't the one graduating but all eyes were on me!!","This was the first dress that I rented form RTR, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. The packaging great, and the dresses arrived in perfect condition! I'm 5'6 almost 5'7, and my weight tends to fluctuate within the 128-135 ish range. A lot of that weight is leg muscle however, so I tend to size down on dresses. After reading the reviews, I decided that I would most likely fit a size 4, and I got a size 2 as a backup. After trying both of them on, I decided to go with the size 2. Although the size 4 was a teeny (almost not noticeable) bit longer, I preferred the size 2 because it hugged my figure. The material is solid without being too thick, and it has a nice slight stretch. It was a little shorter than I'd prefer however. Wearing tights under the dress prevented wardrobe malfunctions. The dress was short enough to reveal the bottom of the darker top portion of my control top Spanx, which has never been an issue before with other dresses, so ladies, be warned, it is short. Nonetheless the lace with the gold accents was such a showstopper. I wore this to a graduation, and my did I turn heads. A couple strangers stopped to compliment me on my dress. Absolutely beautiful and eye catching. The only issue I would say that I had with this dress is the length, but hey, I'm known for scandalously short clothing :) Nothing out of the ordinary for me.","May 16, 2016","True to Size"

The gold lace has a lot of bling in person, so it’s better for a festive or formal affair (if x-short is ok). As everyone notes, this dress is really short – but if you’re petite like me (5”0’) it’s a good length. It seemed to run a bit small. My usual size 0 was sold out, but the 2 turned out to be better. Although I sized up, the sleeves and bust were a little tight (had padded bra on). The lace in the arms is comfortable (as is the whole dress) but prone to snagging, even on itself. The inside black layer is jersey. Could be worn all seasons. On the sexy side for a work event or conservative affair, but perfect for parties, fancy dates or a night on the town. I was happy with this rental, it really made my night.","March 20, 2016","Small"

Running small with no stretch, I recommend wearing your size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works best for A-C cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear NuBra or no bra. At 5 foot, the length hit floor length on me. I loved the design of the dress. Pair with simple strappy sandal.","July 14, 2018","Small"

The XL fit beautifully. It's also quite short, which isn't a problem for 5'2"" me, but could be for taller women.

I loved the lace overlay at the top, and it was very comfortable to wear and true to size (I'm an 8 in real life but often a 6 on RTR).

Beautiful fabric. Cannot wear a bra with this dress because of the cut out on the back but still worked well for me. Very comfortable dress. Got lots of compliments all night!

I was leaving for a work trip the following day and heading straight to an out of town wedding. RTR shipped me two more dresses one of which was the original dress I requested in the size I needed! This dress was beautiful and comfortable. The only con - as a person with a short torso, the top was a big large causing gaping on the back (as seen in the photo).

I am small chested, so it was a little roomy on top and gaped a little in the back, but the smaller size would not stay zipped up.

The front is a higher neck and is a bit more conservative. The hi-low look of the skirt is romantic. The band of the waistline sat right at my natural waist so it was very comfortable to wear. The flounciness of the skirt made it fun to dance and twirl around in. The back of the dress, though you can't see, is stunning. The open back is sexy but it's not extremely open. I didn't need to wear a bra at all (I'm a 34D). Because I'm so short waisted, the fabric did not lay entirely against my skin but it still looked incredible. I felt sexy and chic but understated and glamorous.","October 1, 2017","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW81","Elaine","I wore this to a dressy casual wedding in Alabama.","This dress ran small, especially at the waist! The 10 actually fit okay on me except for the waist so I had to do the 12 where the waist still felt tight! It was the perfect length and I loved that it was slightly lower in the back so I didn't have that awkward thing where your butt makes skirts too short. The dress itself was gorgeous. The fabric is really heavy and the colors are rich and lovely. I felt very pretty in this! I agree with other reviews that said you didn't need to wear a bra but I wanted some support and got a nubra, which worked out just fine. The only thing I didn't like was that, like other reviewers have mentioned, there's no hook-and-eye clasp at the top of the zipper so it is prone to falling down. I had to get my fiance to yank it up as hard as he could and then try very hard to not dislodge it for the rest of the night! (I'm sure that if the dress fit a little more loosely this wouldn't have been such a big deal.) Luckily there wasn't that much dancing but if you wanted to get your groove on, I would choose something a little more secure. I don't think I would wear this again, because of the frustrating zipper problem, but it was so pretty and well made and I am happy that I did get to wear it once!","May 6, 2017","Small"

In my experience the fit ran small, I typically wear a 4-6 and even the 6 was a little tight in the arms area but actually seemed to loosen a little throughout the night and was overall very comfortable. Perfect for winter because of thick material and the pattern, which is more subtle than in the RTR picture but beautiful even in the dark. Very classy but back is amazing.

The material was thick, but the dress was still breathable without being too heavy. The colors were the perfect shade of colors (not too bright or dark) and the gold detailing on the dress really popped. The only con is that the material tends to bunch at the seam where the bodice connects to the skirt (because the material is so thick), which made the dress look slightly unflattering at specific angles.","November 6, 2016","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW81","Shannon","This dress was beautiful and comfortable!","I normally range between 8 & 10 in formal dresses depending on where they are most fitted. I wore the 10 in this dress due to lack of stretch in the waist area and lock for the zipper. I commonly run a size smaller on top so the sz.8 fit my bust area best but my hips and booty called for the 10. It was no surprise that I had to size up to accommodate my bottom half. This dress was very comfortable and got dozens of compliments! I could dance without any fussing. Honestly it was hard to send this dress back! The only con for me and it seems like for other reviewers as well was the zipper. It would fall about an inch every time I moved. I spent a lot of the night pulling it back up.","October 20, 2016","Wedding"

Fabric was forgiving and not super heavy. I wore the back up medium (ordered large) and it was still a bit loose but not in an unflattering way. Ruffle detail at the neckline is adorable and the dress was just comfortable--no tugging/adjusting necessary. The neckline is a bit lower than I expected, but not in a bad way--just enough to make sure I wore a bra that didn't come up too high in the middle. It's just about as short I would go, though I was self conscious or feared flashing my bits and pieces. Tall or leggy ladies, just take note. I would totally wear this again.","July 9, 2018","Large"

However, I'm pretty modest and it wasn't too deep for me :) The website has the size listed as ""XS,"" but it's actually a ""petite small"" so the proportion was much better on my 5'4"" frame. It fits loosely, so you don't have to suck in or be uncomfortable. The color was a beautiful, bright navy and not too dark. I paired this dress with the Kendra Scott ""Nyla Emerald"" earrings and nude sandals (like the model). By the way, these pictures don't do this dress justice. Just wanted to add the pics for an idea of how it looks.","August 1, 2017","Large"

I loved the tea length on me, it was sleek and sassy and I loved how it looked when I walked. The fabric is thick so it is a warm option for chilly weather.

I'm normally a 0 and they only had a 2 so I took a chance based on some of the reviews and I'm glad I did. I definitely recommend going up a size. This fits snug and has some stretch but I think if I had the zero it would've been too tight and would make it tricky to sit down. I didn't notice any issues with the slit in the back but being 5'3"" it's pretty long on me but I really enjoy the length. I wanted something to wear to our office holiday dinner party that was both festive and understated. I think this nails that. One thing--the neck is a little tighter than I expected it to be. It's not bad, I just wanted expecting it to hit my throat in the spot it does so be aware of that if you have any neck sensitivities. Otherwise highly recommend just be sure to go up a size (or two).","December 8, 2018","Party"

It definitely walks the line of formal/not if you are unsure how to dress for a wedding. I wore a size up; I probably could have fit my size as the material stretches but it would have been very unforgiving and the zipper is quite cheap so it may not have gotten up. The dress bunches a bit in a flattering way. If you are tall the back slit comes almost all the way up, but amazingly still doesn't show anything!!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RCY6","RTR Customer","Perfect!","This dress was just perfect. I am 5'2'' and it hit about mid calf. I am smaller chested with a booty, 120 lbs, so the little bit of stretch was great in the size 2.","March 7, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RCY6","Trudi","Comfortable AND stunning!","Like many other reviewers, the dress does run on the smaller side. That said, I could comfortably fit into my regular size 2 (although I can often size down to a 0 in many brands). The dress is very form fitting and flattering for those who have a lean torso. The dress also has a VERY high slit - which at my height was a bit of a problem - but nothing that I couldn't solve with a little fashion tape and a slip. Once I fixed the slit, the dress was incredibly comfortable and I danced all night. Highly recommend if you are lean (and handy)!","January 2, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RCY6","Orquidia","Could not wear","Beautiful fabric and style but not for busty women. Hips fit fine (size 8) but could not zip past the bust. I usually wear a 6-9. In this style, the 12 would fit the bust and be too big in the hips. The style is beautiful and so is the fabric.","November 16, 2018","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RCY6","Cindy","This was easy last minute, not the most fabulous, but got it done.","Very stretchy fabric, for snug but stretch made it comfortable. VERY high slit in the back so I had to be pulling it down and careful not to walk too fast or you could totally see undies. Ordered 10 as back up but it was very bunched up in areas, didn't fit snug.","September 26, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RCY6","Erin","Just the right amount of sparkle, and cover, for a fancy work event.","Material was not particularly thick, so might call for spanx if your so inclined. (I actually didn't wear spanx, and still felt great in it, but I usually prefer a thicker fabric just in case!)","September 9, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RCY6","Kathryn","Too shiny for me","I rented this, intending to wear it to work, but thought no way when I got it home. The material was way too shiny, almost glittery, in a way that didn't feel professional or work-classy. I would have considered wearing it to an event where glittery sparkle was more appropriate.","July 28, 2018","Work"

Just enough ""sexy"" for the casino theme, but classy as well. I have a large bust and the little bit of stretch in the material made it fit perfectly. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the slit in the back goes up very high. It made it just a bit uncomfortable at times. Otherwise, GREAT choice!","February 13, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RCY6","Viva","Runs small","Pretty dress, but the size 2 was too small (and I am normally a size 0). As far as quality, the interior of the dress has large seams, which make it look cheap. But, the exterior looks nice, so over all I would rent this again in a larger size.","February 13, 2018","Party"

I am 6'0 and generally wear a 6 or 8. I would have been able to wear the 6 if not for the slit in the back. The slit came up so high that I could not wear the dress without my underwear being visible. Clearly this isn't a problem for everyone, but I was disappointed that I couldn't wear this one because of it.","January 11, 2018","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RCY6","RTR Customer","Pretty dress TOO SMALL","Love the fabric, inside it reminded me of scuba suit material, comfortable thick and stretchy. The color is really pretty. I have always worn a size 2 or 4. I ordered a 4 in this dress. This is my first order with RTR so maybe all of these designers run extremely small- but to me this dress felt like a 0 at most. I could zip it and it was still comfortable so i can only imagine how comfy it would be when it is the correct size! I recommend, just order a few sizes UP","January 4, 2018","Wedding"
