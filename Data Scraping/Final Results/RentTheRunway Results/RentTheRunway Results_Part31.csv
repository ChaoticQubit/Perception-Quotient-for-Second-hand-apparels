The fit is definitely wide and loose, and it looks great with shorts and skinny jeans. I went with the 1 instead of the 0 because I wanted that boxy oversized look and I didn’t want it to be too cropped. It was not very cropped, and I probably could have sized down but I liked the fit. The arm holes are very large (probably due to the cut and not to the larger size) so the sides of your bra will show on the sides unless you keep your arms down.

I am a 10 on top (36A) and 12 on bottom and the size 8 that I got would barely even hook (I wasn't even wearing a bra). The bottom half of the dress was curiously fine, so it would accommodate for TTS larger hips/butt in my opinion.

Was sad to return it. Also- I'm usually a small in tops , maybe sometimes a medium. When I saw this in the flagship store I held it up and assumed it was a small. Fit perfectly and was surprised to see it was a large - just a note that the fit is off. I'm 5'8"" but on the slender side - I can't see how someone with larger breasts or shoulders would feel comfy in it - which sucks because a large should NOT fit as a small because it excludes anyone larger from feeling like it's a good fit for them.
