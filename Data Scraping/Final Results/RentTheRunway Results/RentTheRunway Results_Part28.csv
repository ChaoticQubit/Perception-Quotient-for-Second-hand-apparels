It's the perfect size for what I like to carry: keys, sunglasses, small wallet, lip gloss, lipstick and phone. There is an inside zipper pocket for little things you don't want to lose and a big phone pocket just inside, too! Love that it's top handle and cross body. The leather is beautiful--very high quality. The only downside is that it's a little tricky to open and close. But overall, I love it! So classy!","February 14, 2020","Everyday"

It's also a great layering piece during the winter since it's sleeveless there's no bulk around the arms/shoulders under a coat but it's VERY warm.

The shoulder straps have two buttons for adjustable length the only thing I needed to work on was having a safety pin in between the chest buttons to keep that closed for more conservativism.

Its a thick, linen material , looks very natural and boho but not scratchy at all. Some of the other reviews said it ran small, which I disagree with. Its supposed to be a tight shirt, so if you don't want a tight fitting top, this top isn't for you, even if you order up a size.

They tend to expose too much of my chest for my comfort, and are hard to manage in an outside (read: windy) commute. This dress might have changed my outlook on the style. Highly recommend!! The dress hits just above my ankle, but I don't think it's awkward at all. The way that the top attaches to the belt and skirt is genius. Rather than having the top wrap all the way across, it naturally stops in the front of my ribs (hard to describe but you can see in the picture). The belt, attached to more skirt fabric, continues so that the wrap of the skirt aligns with the side of my body. I tied a bow in the back.

This dress wraps and buttons at the waist -- I could make the size 6 work, but it was certainly tight at the waist. I did wear a white cami under it and I'm glad I did because it did gape a bit at the bust. Perhaps in my typical size 8 that would have been even worse?

The other reviews are very accurate in saying that the bust runs small - especially given how full the skirt is. I typically wear a 10 in Nicholas, but I rented a 12 based on the reviews. The 12 was much much too large in the skirt, so I switched to the 10. The 10 fit better, but was slightly tight in my chest (I am a 36 B/C for reference). The dress does have a lot of fabric but if you are able to size down, it hangs beautifully. I wore this in Rome with temperatures in the low 80s and it was perfect.

It squeezed me almost to the point of being uncomfortable and I'm very small chested. I think anyone larger than a B cup would need to size WAY up in this.

The dress didn't seem too low cut or the slit too high like others have said. I was comfortable in the office with both. Maybe the black tights helped.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TYB109","Angela","Pop of Color Brightens Up Work Wear","Fantastic colors in this modest yet figure flattering skirt! It is very high waisted, snug at the hips, then flares out to create a lovely feminine silhouette. I wore it with a classic white shirt, tied at the waist and an obi belt to accentuate how tiny this makes the waist look! Another plus is how comfortable it is, I wore it on a plane twice, better than jeans! It's also quite warm, I stayed cozy in winter temps with tights. The fabric is heavyweight, high quality construction. As other reviewers have noted, the primary color is navy, not black. However, paired with black shoes and belt and it looked great. Many compliments including a 20-something man who stopped me on the street and said it was the most amazing skirt he'd ever seen and I looked gorgeous in it. That has NEVER happened in my life (I'm 52). You do have to step into the skirt, but it does stretch. Travels well, does not wrinkle at all. Will definitely rent again.","March 1, 2019","Work"

The fit was exactly as expected - just barely slightly large. I will probably try them again in the 25 (which is my usual R&B size) and I would consider buying them.

The nipped in waist was more definitely form flattering. I thought it was a longer hem from seeing the measurements in the description, but I'm happier it was shorter since I wanted more of a minidress style. So happy with this rental.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VB5","Julia","Power player, but fit is off","I think this blazer runs a little bit big. It fit pretty well in the shoulders (and I loved the powerful look of the shoulder pads), but it felt a little big on my chest (32A) and very long in the arms, even though the length of the body was good for me (5'2"", with a long torso). It didn't look *too* big, but only just barely so. The sleeves were the main issue for me - they're just kind of long! I had to scrunch them up or make sure I was holding my arms just so, so that they wouldn't fall down and graze my palms. The fabric was also not what I expected. Not necessarily a bad thing - it felt like a really nice thick jersey-like knit, rather than a crepe as listed. It does feel weighty and like good quality. Definitely a cool blazer that can go from office to weekend. I really like the look, and the slightly off-white color is versatile, but it was just a bit big on me.","June 18, 2019","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VB5","Maureen","Sharp looking, comfortable, nice for early spring","As a busty blazer lover with average-sized shoulders, it's sometimes hard for me to get a great fit. This one is just about perfect. My arms are of average proportion to my size, but these sleeves are about 4"" too long. The good news is that the jacket still looks good with the sleeves folded up. The weight is just right for early spring, because the jacket is warm enough for outside on a cool day, but still comfortable indoors. It would be fine in summer for an air conditioned office, as well. The white is a true but soft white, probably good for a lot of complexions since it is neither super bright-white or ivory. The trim stitching is a light brown; not noticeable enough to be a color issue. Overall a very nice, high quality, flattering jacket.","April 16, 2019","True to Size"

The entire dress is held closed with two teeny buttons -- one on the inside of the wrap, and one in the bust area. Literally if either one comes undone you will be naked. But beyond that, it just didn't look great on me: big in the waist and I couldn't get the folds of the front to lay right. Oh well.","September 28, 2019","Work"

Also without the usual slip, tights, spanx, etc. This is a very flattering dress. It needs a slip and a bralette to be work appropriate, but it is totally doable. The fabric looks gray, but it is black and white print, where the prints are basically negatives of each other. I really am loving everything I get from this brand. I usually wear a size 8. The 6 fits fine, since I have a small waist. I think the 8 would have worked also, so the sizing is flexible.","May 8, 2019","Large"

The waist is definitely missing something so I added a belt which totally transformed it. I like that there is a chest button so it was not low cut. Hit below my knees and felt true to size. Loved the unique print and the way the dress hung. I even wore it twice!!! Cons- would only recommend this for taller girls with small to medium chests. Since there is only one chest button, I'm sure gaping would be an issue (as others have mentioned).

Now if you find denim stiff, unbreathable, and uncomfortable as I do and prefer silk, it’s great. But it doesn’t really work for anything dressy.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PLL46","Kersten","Breezy Phillip Lim number ideal for a spring day","This dress is darling from the belted waist down -- it feels and drapes like you grabbed a very decent cotton bed sheet and fashioned it into a skirt, not in a bad way. Think Ariel the mermaid when she washes ashore and fashions a ripped sail into a dress. The top half is less interesting -- it's a thick white T-shirt, the end. The sleeves are a bit long and the neck is a bit high -- a slightly more tailored shirt, with a little less coverage, would be cuter, and feel less like the free shirt you got for participating in a 5K. Redeem the skirt portion by hiding the shirt portion; wear it with a cropped jacket and it's a spring winner.","April 1, 2019","True to Size"

I love the designer's eye for draping and he is always great at flattering a woman's natural shape. Many body types can wear his clothes.

The side zipper is helpful and it was very comfortable. Tightest around the waist where the bow is, the 6 fit me perfect and I'm usually a 6 occasionally a 4 so if you are between sizes I'd size up since you can always sinch it a little tighter using the tie.

Most size 12's fit me, but I think this is a designer size 12, which seem to run smaller. FYI--The dress has a partial side zipper mid-torso. I think a slimmer person would look great in it.

However, these pants were way too big around the waist. I could fit both my arms inside the pants when they were zipped up and there was room for more. I usually only wear high-waisted pants because I find that they are the only pant style that fits me around the waist (I’m pretty tall and have an athletic build.) These pants were a big exception to that. I don’t think I’d recommend sizing down though because they seemed to fit fine around the legs. All in all, I just think the proportions of these pants are off.","October 17, 2019","Large"

Their is an extra inside tie to prevent the wraparound skirt from blowing open. Cotton material is very lightweight and great for summer without looking cheap. Ruffles on the bottom bring the right amount of fun while still being appropriate for work or daytime event.

It is essentially made it a maxi dress for me. I will say however, that I can't see anyone wearing this dress alone without some sort of bralette underneath. There are no darts in the bust, so it's really wide at the top part of your chest and sort of sticks out on the sides of your armpit holes so it would be pretty revealing regardless of your bust size. That didn't bother me too much, so I just threw a black one on and when I'm on my way.","June 16, 2019","True to Size"

Running true to size with a little stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works for A to C cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra or no bra since there is an open back. At 5’3”, the length hit at knee length on me. The dress is amazing in person.

And yet, I continue to hope and pray for a knit outfit that looks amazing on my frame! I need to let this dream die. I know I do. This photo is flattering. If you check the side view you see a different story- my butt - which is actually fairly high and perky for my age and stature - looks like a flat pancake; there is no definition between the small of my back and the large of my booty, I don't even know how that happens. The back of the top clings to my ...let's call them ""lats"" instead of back fat. It is all rather unfortunate. I made the best of it for work, because the only thing I hate more than a flat ass is waste. I dug up this vintage belt and did a bit of magic to pull off the waistline and put some super boring brown jimmy chop pumps to work. All in all, with a dash of red lipstick, I was satisfied.

It is both chic and modern, but it is NOT something I could ever wear to work. Firstly, I felt like I needed an instruction manual to put it on: there's a little loop that adds some amount of structure, then kind of a tent flap that goes over the head so that the rest can be wrapped around. The end result is something I can't wait to wear out this weekend, but had to immediately take off because it showed way too much of my sides and bra to ever be something I could wear to the office. I definitely picked this out of a ""work edit"" series, so I was frustrated, but I do have other plans for this little number.","June 20, 2019","True to Size"

I think this would look cute with low-rider pants, but since I prefer a higher waist, the opening showed a sliver of skin and the waistband of my pants -- it just looked weird. I could have work a tank underneath, but I really wanted the simpler silhouette.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VD52","Tara","Comfy bodycon sweater dress, appropriate for work","Appreciate that this sweater dress has thick opaque fabric - didn't need a slip. It is ribbed and a bodycon style, so a bit tighter than my usual work wear, but still doable and appropriate for the office (wore with tights and low black booties). The dress was true to size, so not super form fitting, but definitely hugged me around my stomach and hip area; would probably work well with spanx for extra comfort and security. The red trim makes the dress unique. I took off a star because the material does trap a lot of lint/hair, more than most dresses, so by 11am I was starting to feel a bit like a fuzzball.","January 7, 2020","True to Size"

It has two buttons so you can wear the skirt a couple of different ways (tight and fitted or loose and drooping). CONS: I really wanted to wear this, but I could not get the top to sit right. It is definitely made for women who can fill out the top. Smaller-chested women will have problems with the neckline bunching up. I just couldn't do anything with it. The sides were also very wide and flared out. It's too bad because the skirt fit perfectly, so sizing down was not an option for me.","February 23, 2020","Large"

I am generally between a 4 and a 6 and opted for the 38, but would get the 36 next time for comparison as there is extra space in the waist and front panel.

The animals and stars are partially woven into the knit and partially embroidered. In terms of fit, this sweater runs true to size to slightly large. I am usually a size 8-10 (5'8"", 154 lbs, 36C) and rented this sweater in size Large (8-10). That size fit a bit slouchy on me, but the next size down might have been too small. Therefore, I would say the size Large equates to sizes 10-12 in this sweater. Note that this is a warm sweater (great for New England winters) and a bit itchy.

The side pockets the model is shown using don't hit where I'd ideally want such a pocket, but I doubt I'd be using them in any practical way anyways. These are certainly going to add bulk to a look, so if you're happy with that (as I am) I'd recommend giving these a try!","March 27, 2020","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SMY37","Alex","Amazing!!!","Definitely one of my favorite jumpsuits I've ever worn (coming from someone who's slightly obsessed with jumpsuits)! I would have preferred a medium but it wasn't available at the time so I went with a large. If I had the medium instead I would've bought instead of returning and am hoping a medium becomes available at some point so I can do just that. I wore this to a spring fashion photo shoot held in a park and it was so stunning in all the pictures. Wore again to lunch with my family and before I could even consider buying it, my mom told me I had to buy this one if I could because it was too fabulous looking on. It can definitely be dressed up or down depending on the shoes and accessories worn. Also love how you can change around how the front is tied to create slightly different looks. Since the top doesn't have any other closure besides the front tie, it's extremely adjustable, so I would definitely pick the size based on the bottom part of it. The large fit well but was a little big in the waistband, not enough that it was really falling down, but (especially when I sat) the waistband would sag down some/create a gap instead of staying flush against my waist. The length was great, slightly cropped on me at 5'8"", but still at a trendy crop level, not looking like it was too short, especially since the legs are wide. Seriously cannot recommend this jumpsuit enough!!","June 19, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SMY37","Kaitlin","This was so fun to wear! You could easily dress it up or down depending on your need.","I thought it ran a little small, but mainly thru the waist only. I typically wear a small, and although the small did fit, I didn't like that when I sat down, the waist kind of dug into my stomach. With it being exposed, I didn't want to look like a sausage anytime I sat down. I decide to wear the medium, which fit pretty baggy. I felt like there was a lot of extra fabric in the M and really wish the S had 1 more inch in the waist. Either way, it was a cute romper for a night downtown with my man. It paired nicely with platform sandals and would look good on either tall or short gals, as the wide leg would look nice as a full length or cropped length. Again, I liked the length a bit better on the small and really wish that size fit better!","May 22, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RED83","Kelly","Disaster","This dress didn't work out at all. The concept and color are super cute, but the fit was way too big. I typically wear a size 6 so I rented the recommend Italian size 42. Huge! Too long (although I'm 5' 4'' so I guess on the shorter side) and the bottom was super baggy. The chest/shoulder area was also a little loose, but the bigger fit issue was definitely the bottom half of the dress. Would recommend sizing down for this. This dress is also probably better if you're taller.","October 30, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RED83","Elisa","Not for me","I love peter pan collars and bows and pink so I thought this was going to be a major win. Unfortunately, it did not work on my body. I'm not sure how to explain it, it just ended up looking sloppy and sad instead of cute. Strong rose colour that would work in multiple seasons on the right body. Needs to be steamed upon arrival as it wrinkles easily and is a bit tight in the shoulders, otherwise TTS.","October 16, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RED83","Cari","Adorable!","Absolutely loved this dress. I sized up (I'm a solid 4, and wore a 42), because Valentino tends to run small. Glad I did - it fits perfectly.","October 1, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TER4","Celia","Weird fitting","I thought this was really cute from a perspective of pattern and look. But the thing is, the sleeves were really short (almost 3/4 length) , and the shoulders fit weird. It also had a cropped look, which it doesn't seem to have on the model. It was fine for a quarantine casual Friday (as every day is these days) but I wouldn't want to wear it outside.","May 1, 2020","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TER4","Taylor","Very comfortable stylish sweatshirt","I rented this for casual Friday at work but ended up just wearing it over my gym clothes because it was a little too cropped for the office.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS201","Monica","Perfect for an Interview","I rented Kate Spade dresses before in my normal size and they were too small, so I was nervous about renting the brand again. I read all the renews though and the thing that was supposed deferent about this dress was the elastic waist. I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. My interview was at my current company and everyone told me how great I looked in the dress. It was very comfortable. The dress was a bit big and because of this the neckline plunged very low. To fix this I just tied the knot in the dress to hit right where the neckline started. I'd rent this dress again and hope I am able to find more great Kate Spade dresses like this one.","June 28, 2019","Work"

The material is stretchy, I felt a little constrained but I wasn't worried it was going to bust at the seams or anything like that. I don't think this size would work for anyone bigger than a 26in waist though. If you have broad or athletic shoulders I recommend sizing up. The black laser-cut out part is attached to a light gray netting, and the whole dress (except the sleeves) is lined in black. It's hard to tell in the RtR pics, so I took a close-up pic of the material with a white paper behind it. The netting isn't itchy, but it's noticeably not soft. The length is good for work, it rides up a little when I sit as most dresses do, but I wasn't afraid to bend over to open a file drawer or anything. Overall a cute fun dress for work, loses 1 star for the minor discomforts of being tight-fitting and not soft.","July 10, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW600","Amanda","Once you see it, you can't unsee it","I really wanted to love this dress. It's a great design in theory, but the execution is poor. Like other reviewers noted, this runs very small. I am a true size 4 and sized up to a medium. The other issue I had is that the pattern is off center in both the top half and the skirt (see photo). Once I noticed this, it kept bothering me. I checked the photo of the model to see if this was intentional, but the dress on RTR's model shows a symmetrical pattern and a perfectly matched top and bottom half, making my uneven pattern even more irritating. This seems like a quality control issue that the designer could easily have corrected. Disappointing.","June 24, 2019","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW600","Courtney","Nice work dress, runs small. Great length for short girls!","I wanted to be obsessed with this dress, but I just liked it, and maybe that's because it'd be a great work dress and I'm now an RN and only wear scrubs. Pros: I'm 5'2"" and it's hard finding good mid-length dresses; this hits right above the knee for me and looks perfect! Also the cutout pattern is super cool, and it looks very chic. Cons: the fabric is on the heavier side but is not the most flattering. I'm a size 6-8 hips and 4-6 waist, it didn't really do much to show off my figure. Also definitely runs small as I got the large based on other reviews, I think a medium would've been too tight. Also not sure how it'd fit on a larger chest. Overall it really is a super cute dress, I just don't think it's cut for my shape or my preference for fit.","May 17, 2019","Other"

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works for cup sizes A-C. You are able to wear a standard bra with this dress. At 5’4”, the length hit mid-thigh on me. I recommend wearing tights so this dress can go from business casual to happy hour! The pattern on the dress is amazing in person and makes it a very unique piece.

I have an athletic build with a nice size butt and this dress was a little restricting in the arms and the butt area. I would go one size up to have a little more freedom. Overall loved the dress.","August 2, 2019","Work"

It was a touch tight around the bra line/rib cage but otherwise was a forgiving fit. The top of dress allowed space for a large bust. The front ties were long but not cumbersome. Sleeves were long, though you can fold them up. They won't stay folded but it helps while eating, etc.","May 19, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP47","Jessie","So many compliments","This dress makes you feel fab! Arms are slightly tight so I would size up if you've got bigger arms - shouldn't affect the fit of the dress. Highly recommend!","May 17, 2019","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP47","Catherine","This is the perfect dress for a work cocktail party!","Fit is TTS and the ties in front let you adjust the bust a bit. The dress is lined but it's thin material so Spanx are a must if you have any lumpy bits.","May 3, 2019","True to Size"

This dress hugged all the right places, was light and airy, but did not show everything (that being said you CAN see a panty line, so dress accordingly)! Loved the color and I love sleeves and these sleeves were FUN as they are meant to drape down your hands, which gives a great retro feel! I wore this for a speaking engagement and didn't want the day to end!! Enjoy, this one makes you feel giddy and special!","February 8, 2019","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP47","Ruthi","It's comfortable","It's cute-ish, and comfortable. The color is fantastic. The tie is... not great. I tried to tie it in a bow to make the length not trip-able but it untied nearly immediately after the one photo I took and at 5'7"", it was still a battle of not tripping over it when I wore it the two times I did. If the tie would've been shorter, it would've been super cute and a lovely casual dress to wear, but because of that, it definitely isn't a favorite rental of mine and I won't be renting it again and I wore it barely at all comparing how often I wear pieces I love before returning them. It definitely runs large in comparison to other dresses on this site, so I would say size down if you're in between sizes like I am!","January 26, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP47","Meghan","Tripping hazard","I love the color and the shape of this dress, and would consider wearing it if it weren't for the incredibly long tie. In flat shoes it drags on the ground and in heels I'm guaranteed to still trip on it. Nice shape to the dress and fabric has a nice drape. Might be better for ladies over 6'","January 11, 2019","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP47","Yakeata","Not a true red and I love it!","I love this dress! It's simple, sophisticated and chic. Perfect work dress for the office or any professional setting. It was loose in the right places and still hugged three right curves. I would reccomend this dress for all body types. The color is perfect as well and I think pairs with other colors just perfectly or even patterns since it's a solid color. I felt comfortable all day yet stylish. I even had a lady tell me she really needed to have this dress. I know the pictures do not give it justice as it's a dress you must wear to truly appreciate!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP47","Jax","Lovely but runs smalls in bust","Lovely dress but it was a bit tight across the arms/bust. I decided not to wear for fear it might tear it just be uncomfortable all day. I think so I g up would've been too big everywhere else. So if you are busty I'd consider that when ordering the material does not stretch.","March 5, 2020","Other"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP47","Avery","Great dramatic sleeves and wonderful color.","The top was a bit snug and the upper waist bow made it hard to style. The hips were larger for me than the top of the dress ( I am slightly on the bustier side), and the lack of give in the fabric mad the dress unwearable based on the extra fabric in the hips. The hem hit at exactly the right spot and I would love to have worn it if the hips fit correctly.","September 16, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP47","J","Never fails","I've worn this dress 4x now and gotten complimented by people i know AND random strangers every single time. Decided it was a keeper! The ties actually make the cut very flattering. The material is lined but not too heavy so it's versatile for warmer or cooler weather. The 6 was great for me to accent my waist but i did need help with zipping because the sleeves were restricting. Nonetheless, it's mine now and I'm so happy i got to ""test drive"" this dress before committing to it.","August 7, 2019","Work"

It definitely needs a belt and, as you can see in the picture, if you're not y'all the front will slouch a little bit I still think it looks good with a belt. I wore this top with both a black belt and a tan belt with burnt orange crop flare corduroy pants and also wore it with black slacks. Can be dressed up or down. There are three interior buttons that hold this top closed so it will not blow open if you walk outside. A+ shirt","October 31, 2019","Work"
