"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/STD8","Jennie","Not a fan","This dress looked great in the bodice. Every other part of the dress was a disaster on me. The little sleeves are elastic all the way around and were tight on my arms. They also didn't give that sexy, off the shoulder look, because the elastic kept them in an awkward location on my bicep. The bottom the dress was very ""saloon girl."" I thought it would be nice for a beach vacation, but it just didn't work on me.","February 20, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AX176","Michelle","Feminine floral","Pretty dress, great length. It was a little cold here so I put a sweater on top. Can be worn with dress shoes as well as it is slightly formal material-wise. True to size and you can wear a standard bra. Two things: the buttons down the front are a very shiny gold color, which threw me a little and the material is slightly heavy and stiff. Now that's probably why it keeps its form and doesn't wrinkle. But not a ""light and flowy"" dress if that's what you're expecting!","February 18, 2020","Party"

It is heavy so may be too warm for a hot day but perfect for spring. I'm larger in the bust and sized up to the L and it fit perfect. This would be a great dress to wear to attend a wedding. Because it is so heavy and crisp I think it would be too much for a casual event. Very flattering and slimming fit.","February 20, 2020","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AX176","Laura","Beautiful colors","This dress is an absolute compliment-magnet. The flowers are vibrant and the buttons make it easy to pair with gold jewelry. Note that it is not silk but some kind of polyester, so while it is easy to travel with (no wrinkles) it is stiff and heavy. It would be way too hot for a summer wedding, IMO. Fit was true to size but tight around the rib cage.","February 13, 2020","Date"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CD55","Cheryl lynn6","💛 BRIGHTEN ANY EVENT WITH THIS BUTTERFLY BEAUTY","Wow, gorgeous in person! Very, very bright yellow yet managed not to cross over into tackiness (IMO). At first glance fairly conservative, but the sheer skirt with partial mini slip brings a sexiness to it (especially if there is a bright light source behind you). The adjustable straps were a bonus - I was initially skeptical as they looked a little wimpy, but the dress fit so nicely the straps didn't have to do much work. Fit TTS, if in doubt I'd size up. I would definitely rent this again to wear to a wide range events from daily to formal. Looking forward to trying this brand again, this was my first.

The bodice has boning and fits snug so size up if you're bustier as there isn't a lot of room in the chest. This dress in particular had already had a strap repair and the strap (which is like cloth ribbon) was fraying and detaching but overall one of my favorite rentals!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK419","Kathleen","Disappointed!","I was so looking forward to this dress but will not wear it. It is simply two sheer layers of fabric so it is see through. A summer only dress. The ruffle above knee is only one layer so it shows too much leg if taller. Fit a little snug compared to all other 6s I have rented.","March 2, 2020","Date"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/IRO55","Audrey","38R fits like a 6/8?","I gave it 4 stars because it's VERY low cut and I safety pinned the front. And the straps are VERY long and I had to safety pin them back. I'm a giant and a 30E so if this dress doesn't fit my shoulders and boobs, it won't fit anyone. But the material is super soft and it's a nice casual day dress. On talk girls it's still flattering enough. On short girls, this will be a maxi.","February 26, 2020","Everyday"

However, it's overall amount of fabric overhwhelmed me. Plenty of room for large busts, and does not show too much cleavage, but would work best for those with very small waists/larger hips.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SPT25","Bridget","BEAUTIFUL and so unique","LOVED this dress, cut and style are absolutely gorgeous and unique. Subtly sexy with nude lining.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SPT25","Michelle","Utterly beautiful, but a little hard to wear.","First off I thought this dress would be much more casual than it is. The half lined skirt, the open weaving, it all looked very beachy to me. But in person it has a lot of structure and frankly it's nice enough that I could see someone wanting to get married in it. The two stars off are for the cutaways near the bust. There is literally no bra I could wear with this, it wasn't tight enough to go braless, and gaffer tape would have shown through - even nude. The half lined skirt was not modest enough for me so I added a slip, but my slip wasn't the same shade of nude as what is in the dress, so it looked worse with the extra slip. I considered buying it and have the tailor fix it up just for me. But it's just a little too formal for my lifestyle and I don't think I'd get that much wear out of it. Sooo pretty though!","April 2, 2020","True to Size"

I am usually a US size 2 and the UK 6R fit pretty well, although the bodice was a little tight. If you are between sizes (especially if you have a larger bust size) I would size up-otherwise just get your normal size (after converting US to UK size of course). Because the bodice was tight it pushed your armpit fat out at the sides, but the lace detail at the bodice covers it up so the dress still looks flattering in photos. It's also a good dress regardless of height, as the tea length works for short or tall people. Great dress to dress up or down.","March 16, 2020","Small"

So I ordered my UK size (2 sizes up) and this time it was just a little big around the waist and hips. But the top of the dress and its overall length are designed for someone over 6 feet tall. I think someone messed up during drafting and production. I have two other pieces from this brand in my closet, they are UK sized and the fit is spot on.

If my budget allowed, this would be mine forever. Size note: if in doubt size up one size. I consider myself a true size 6 but wear about 50/50 size 4 or 6.

The top is loose as others have mentioned, but clung enough that I didn't worry about my bra showing (I'm a C cup). Ultimately, I think that this would be best to wear at work or a nice dinner.

The only thing I would change is the low front, I would prefer not to wear a cami and have the top more fitted. But I consider this a daytime dress so I didn't mind. This is also a faux wrap as there is a side zipper. The tie does go around your waist to have that wrap style look. I prefer a faux wrap to a real wrap any day.

The fabric was light and flowing. Semi-sheer with a very high front slit which artfully drapes closed (be careful on windy day though). Has white mini slip under which would stick out a tad if I tried to get pic with leg extended to show off slit. The ruched bodice is so flattering. The little sleeve thingy does have an arm hole, so it stays in place. Very long, I'm 5'8"" and it swept the ground, even with heels I had to be careful not to step on it. It overall fit TTS though for me it was big in bust (I'm 34C) so probably perfect for those of you that are blessed in the chest department. I will 100% borrow this again.

It's also more of a pink and red in person than in the photo! I found the ruffles to be more aggressive than I pictured too.","January 12, 2020","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL90","Lisa","This dress is gorgeous!!","I ordered it before it had any reviews and so glad I did. Fits true to size. It's a thin rayon/ silk material with a black lining and does not have a lot of give. Flowers are pink and red but isn't too loud. Front has a clip closure and shows the perfect amount of cleavage. I did not wear a bar but you could wear a racer back if needed. The ruffles and slit make the dress, so pretty! I was able to sit, eat and dance all night comfortable. Amazing dress!","November 25, 2019","Wedding"

The red is more pink than red.","November 19, 2019","Formal Affair"

The dress skims the body, the slit is well placed and attractive, but the way it laid on my body was just not that flattering. The belt wasn't long enough. I get the impression that the belt is the same length regardless of the size of the dress so on a smaller size it may tie and drape like it does on the model but on my large size body it looked like a little bow on the side of the dress.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CO87","Samantha","Weird fit. Beautiful top.","Okay, so I'm tiny. A true 00. I think this designer tends to run small, so that is usually okay for my. I have a really narrow ribcage/bust so strapless things are always a little hard for me to keep up. That being said, this top was somehow both too small and too big... it was way too big to stay up without a bra, but too small/where the seems are on the bust made it impossible to wear a strapless, which would have helped it stay up. It's such a pretty top though. So if you're tiny like me, but have bigger boobs (I'm a 32 C) then maybe you could wear this.

It is fully lined. Very nice. But it didn't really work for me. The smocking wasn't my style, too young and sweet and I'm feminine and I can be sweet but it was a little too much. The ruffles on the bodice were more syrup on the sweet, and from certain angles they weren't very flattering. The waist is very high, also like a young girls dress.

The problem is, the top part fits loose, so if you size up the top might look too baggy. Beware that if you run bigger in the butt/hips or if you have a pear shape body, this prob won't work for you. For reference, I'm a 37/27/39 - bust/waist/hips- hourglass- and I was barely able to pull it off.

I am a smaller-chested gal and thought it was still classy, but decided to wear a black cami underneath since I was attending an event with high schoolers that my husband teaches. I am small around the ribs/waist, but if you carry any extra weight there, go up a size. As others have mentioned, don't expect to raise your arms above your head in this thing.

I have an hourglass shape body, so it did excentuate my waist. My two complains were, I felt like my cleavage was busting out (I do have a 34D size breast), and I did not love the length.

The flowers and polka dots on sleeves just felt a bit too spring-y for fall/winter, even though the dress is black. liked the sleeves as I have surgical scars on my upper arms- adjustable so will fit anyone well.

Beautiful dress and colors, I'm going to try to rent again but will size up at least 2 sizes.","January 31, 2020","Everyday"

It felt a bit too large up top, the v neck was very low, but the dress was on the shorter side. I wanted to wear it during the day time, but the v neck line plunged way too low to be considered appropriate for where I was going. Seems like it's a good dress for those with long torsos.","January 21, 2020","Large"

Would be so cute on St. Patrick's Day - I'm calling dibs for 2021! 😉 I adored the flouncy little ruffles which will swish when you move. The white lining wanted to flip to the outside along front top edge, so I was adjusting that, but no biggie. Didn't have full side zip so was a little tricky to get my wide shoulders through. These 2 points seem nit-picky cos this is just a sweet little dress. Just trying to give you the 411. Ran a smidge small. I'm a 6 but often wear 4 and thought this fit more like a 4. I found it tight through rib area but not unbearable. If you're uncertain size up. I will probably buy this one when it goes on sale, it's just perfect for life here in Florida.

You look put together without trying too hard, though I would definitely recommend boots or booties, as heels would be overkill. The only downside is that the buttons are really far apart and because it's silk, they tend to gape when you're sitting down regardless of how much fabric there is. I would put fashion tape between some of the buttons, but DO NOT pin, as it will ruin the material for future users and would easily rip, given the fabric.","February 7, 2020","True to Size"

Also I needed to pull the back very very tight in order to make the straps short enough so the dress wasn't too low. It was a bit hard to take deep breaths in the car.

This was very pretty, more flattering in person, I think, than the pictures show. I wore if for date night (dinner and bowling) then again for pandemic date night at home. I just felt so chic every time I put it on! I will rent this one again.","April 24, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BDT17","Sarah","CUTEST romper ever. I want to wear it over and over.","I have broad shoulders and a larger chest so I automatically got an XL instead of a L and the XL fit perfectly. I also could not zip this myself so make sure you have someone or can ask someone. I wore this to a Texas country concert and it was absolutely perfect. I could see myself wearing this out to bars or a date. (Just change what shoes you're wearing!) It is a short inseam but the ruffles conceal any rogue cheeks. Would def rent again.","March 8, 2020","Party"
