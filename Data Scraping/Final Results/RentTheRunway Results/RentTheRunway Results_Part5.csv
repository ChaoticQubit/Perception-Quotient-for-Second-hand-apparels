I don't think it's as unforgiving as some of the other reviews have said however I could have gone down a size too. A must rent for sure!","January 30, 2020","Work"

Deducted a star because of a small tear at supper though the dress was brand new. Since the zipper goes up so high you will need a buddy to assist. Was not too long at all.","January 13, 2020","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PYM4","Michelle","So Comfortable!!","Unique color and made from a really comfy stretch material. Just a little plain on its own. Can be clingy. I added the vest and belt which added to my winter look. But I liked it overall.","December 19, 2019","Date"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PYM4","Emily","Deli mustard yellow adds all the flavor to a virtual work outfit!","I loved this color & my current hair is blue so the contrast was ON POINT. Dress is stretchy but fitted- shows your body. There's no hiding in this dress! So you better be feeling yourself or sporting some spanx - but I'm guessing we're all letting the spanx take a vacation during quarantine, right? Even though I'm WFH, I'm on lots of Video calls. I styled with a simple gold necklace and rainbow crystal demarson earrings and matching suede Manolos. Yep heels- I was feeling myself!","March 30, 2020","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PYM4","Ameerah","Didn't wear - very thin","I LOVE the detailing of this dress and may rent it again in the warmer months. But the fabric is so thin for colder temps. The fabric clings and not very forgiving. It shows every little lump and bump. As a result of the fabric this sat a bit more body con than I wanted it to.","February 27, 2020","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PYM4","Rachel","Every lump and bump","This is such a gorgeous, unique dress, but it is utterly unforgiving. The material was so clingy that I could see my belly button through it. Like walking into a party naked, only less flattering.","January 9, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Lauren","Snazzy 70s and so comfortable","This was a perfect going-out dress: fun, sexy, and unbelievably comfortable. The color is a little less magenta and a little more plum in person. It has shoulder pads, but I didn't think they were very noticeable. The overlapping hem was generous enough that I was never worried about being indecent. I would recommend this in a heartbeat.","March 1, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Kirstie","Attention getter","I liked this dress. The color is beautiful, and I added a filter to this photo to better show how vibrant it is. It was short even on my short-legged frame (thus the tights). It was comfortable and stretchy but I felt it hid my curvy figure. Definitely had to pin the chest.","February 29, 2020","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Emily","Great fit!","Loved this dress, it is sparkly but not overwhelming. Wore it for some of my engagement photos on a COLD day and stayed relatively warm. Great fit on the waist and chest, very comfortable. A little tight for me on the butt but I have a bigger one and I think that's how it's supposed to be.","January 27, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Anna","Good winter party dress, but low-cut and short in the front!","I rented this for the long sleeves because I didn't want to hide a cute dress under a cardigan when it's cold. However it is very low cut so you have to pin it, and the bottom is actually shorter in the front where it wraps. Need tights! So it was a lot more revealing and also tighter than I expected. I considered getting a different dress but ultimately stuck with this one and I am glad I did. Also it's over the head, so if you have broad shoulders you need to size up just to put it on!","January 21, 2020","Party"

A tad short, but just be careful while sitting down. Wore the medium but could have also worn the small, the medium just felt slightly more forgiving. Overall, a fun party dress!","December 27, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","RTR Customer","Beautiful dress","I didn't end up wearing this dress to my occasion as it turned out to be a little more of a casual look than I was going for. But this dress is still beautiful. i love the way it drapes and feels. I was worried the sleeves would be too long and would look bunched up since I am on the shorter side and that often happens (5'3). But the sleeves were the perfect length. The only issue I had was the color felt a little off from the original photo. I feel in the light it is a much lighter purple than expected, rather than a dark violet color. So something to consider depending on the event you attend and their lighting situation.","December 25, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Diana","Not Your Average Company Christmas Party Dress","In a sea of red and white dresses, this purple dress stood out! I received compliments left & right. The dress was a little TOO low cut for the occasion (husband's company Christmas party) so I safety pinned it. The material is thin but not sheer & it travels well. I was happy with the level of sparkle although this picture does not do it justice. I recommend!","December 22, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Yvette","Perfect dress for a night out!","I rented this dress for my company holiday party and I absolutely LOVED it! The material & color are so beautiful in person and it photographed really well. I got the Large & XL but wore the XL as it was a little less tight in the midsection but the dress drapes nicely & has a good stretch to it throughout. I don't like to show too much cleavage so I did pin it with a small safety pin to make it a bit more comfortable in the chest area. Overall a great dress that I would definitely recommend!","December 17, 2019","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Madison","Fun, comfy dress perfect for a NYE party or wedding (and flattering)","highly recommend it. I'm usually a large or xl depending on the designer and went with the XL for this. It was a Friday night wedding in the Midwest so it was cold. Wore black tights and black shoes. Stretchy material. I did pin it at the chest for less cleavage. Loved it. Would make a great NYE dress. The only thing I didn't like was the shoulder pads but they didn't end up bothering me or making me feel too broad!","December 2, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Ellen","Sparkly and Fun","Great dress for a holiday party. It's sparkly but tasteful. It is quite short and I felt I needed a colored hose. I'm only 5'4"" so it would be even shorter if you're taller. The cut is very flattering and hides any flaws.","November 27, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Suzanne","Cute","This dress is very cute and the color is fun. The only issue I had with this dress it that it needed to be pinned in the front because it would not lay right. The lining in the skirt part laid strangely too, and the seams showed through which I found annoying.","March 3, 2020","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Bridget","Perfect for a winter wedding. Worn with black tights and booties.","The deep v in the front needed to be pinned by safety pin otherwise there was too much boobs (and not appropriate for church wedding ceremony). Sitting down was tricky too, there's no actual skirt and just folds of fabric so beware of showing too much leg when sitting down. Otherwise, this was one of my favorite rentals I've done!","January 30, 2020","Small"

It was a little shorter in person than I was anticipating but I just watched how I stood/sat for the night I wore it. Overall, it's a really fun party dress and I'd definitely wear it to another event. The dress almost feels a little 80's with the shoulder pads and sleeves which is super fun!","January 23, 2020","Small"

I used fashion tape on the deep V which worked out fine. Unfortunately don't have a picture but this was great and comfortable and I'd wear it again. The fabric is a purple shimmer which was really pretty.","December 28, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Alicia","Flattering Fit","Gorgeous color, shiny material up-close but, the sparkle doesn't really show up on camera from a distance. It looks like a flat purple color on tv, when you're not up-close. I work in entertainment so, these details are important for some folks :) Great overall fit. The top was a little loose but, was fine with fashion tape. Flattering material, breathable, stretchy, not too tight in hips, stomach area. Sexy dress.","November 29, 2019","Work"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Alexis","Flattering fit, very purple","I rented this for my husband and I's first date post-baby. At 7 weeks postpartum I was feeling pretty self conscious about my body and wanted something sexy that wouldn't hug the wrong places. The wrap on this falls in just the right place. I was surprised by just *how* purple this dress was because in the photos it looks like dark purple shimmer. It is like orchid purple lurex on a black fabric so it's PURPLE. It was pretty, just unexpected.","November 13, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLR100","Holly","Cute dress for a Fall wedding!","This dress was really cute and I got a lot of compliments. Fit wise, I am usually a 10/12. I felt the large was a little tight around my mid section and I liked the fit of the XL better, which I ended up wearing. The XL was a little big in the vneck area though, as when I bent forward it was really baggy and you could fully see down it. Double sided tape didn't stick to the fabric so I ended up safety pinning it shut a bit and that did the trick.","November 12, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP99","Sheilanova","Like thin scuba material- great for roomy hips","Others have commented that you need a smaller bust size. I have a 34D bust and my boobs looked amazing but I think any bigger bust might have issues. That said, I am an hourglass figure but I think this dress would go great on a pear shape or anyone will bigger hips and booty as the hips had room. The material is not a knit- it feels like a thin scuba material. No zipper which is nice too- I stepped into it, but you could also put it over your head.","January 4, 2020","Date"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP99","Micaela","Weird extra space in hips","Couldn't wear - I consider myself pretty proportional, but there was a ton of extra room in the hip area that made the dress bunch up around the waist as well.

I decided to size up as it was my first jumpsuit from Lilly, but I should have ordered my true size 10. It still fit, just a little loose. I love the print, the length, the fabric. It comes with a waist tie that shows as secured at the back, but I preferred it as a front tie so styled it that way.

The size 2 fit perfectly with just a little breathing room, other than in the bust, which didn't really feel tight but needed a stronger or maybe additional snap to keep the neckline closed, as it did pop open a few times - but it was only mildly revealing when it did so, so not a big deal. No stretch to the fabric so if you're between sizes definitely size up rather than down. Super flattering dress, would rent agin and might even buy. Highly recommend!","January 25, 2020","Party"

But the two main issues are that 1) this runs short-ish, from shoulder to hem, and 2) the bottom of the shirt is quite fitted. If you have a long torso and/or any muffin top, you'll be fiddling with it the whole time. I tried it on with high waisted trousers, and it worked more or less, but I just couldn't commit to wearing it because I didn't want to be pulling it down all day long. Additionally, if a long torso and muffin top are not issues for you (!) and you decide to rent it anyhow, I will note that the slit in front goes down pretty far, so if your office is conservative, this won't work.","February 13, 2020","Small"

I liked that the straps adjusted to fit tighter. This dress doesn’t boost your cleavage but you shouldn’t need a bra. Im rather curvy with wider hip and I felt it accentuated my curves nicely...the pendulum isn’t ‘too much’ for a curvy girl. There’s a small slit up the right side that’s just the right amount of sexy. I sized one size up from my normal 8.

I liked the adjustable straps but did notice that they shifted pretty quickly while trying on the dress and moving around. I loved the pablum in the front as it hid my ""little food belly"". Lol.

My boyfriend was best man in his friends wedding so I wanted to look my best. I'm normally skeptical about peplum dresses and was afraid of being lost in the ruffles. But the dress fit me perfectly and was really well made. I saw people talking about the straps slipping; on me they did get looser while moving around and dancing but they weren't falling off my shoulders.

I wore it for a work event during the day, then got on a flight to a wedding reception and wore it at the outdoor cocktail reception. It went seamlessly from day to night with just a switch of the shoes. The belt was stiff enough to hold things in and cinch the waist without being constrictive on the plane. I loved the pockets and the lightweight fabric (it was hot in both places). The top was a bit baggy but nothing a small safety pin didn't fix, closing a maybe too deep V for a work event.

The 2 was a bit tight over my hips, but I chose to wear it instead of the 4 because the bodice fit my small chest better. With a sticky bra, the top fit like it was tailored.

I am usually a 4 in most brands, but I think this ran a bit big. I wore a 4, I could have sized down to a 2. My waist is 27 inches, I had at least 2 extra inches in the waist. I do have a small chest, so the top gaped when I was sitting, but a safety pin easily fixed that issue. Runs a tad big, but don't hesitate to rent it.

It can make the open shoulder limited to movement but nothing dramatic, dinner and drinks is easy.

Would be amazeballs with cute tap shorts and heels/ankle booties, but it's still too cold here. I'll get it again when the weather warms up, don't worry! Mine came w/out the belt, but I don't miss it. RTR offered to replace, but I didn't want to part with it :) The generous stretch made it super comfortable - usually these off the shoulder numbers aren't great for anything but posing, but I could rock a Warrior 1 AND 2 in this. Not sure it's for ladies with big boobies as the chest fit quite well on my B's. Def size up if you're a C+. I have very broad ""athletic"" shoulders. It fit perfectly there too, which is rare.

The heavy fabric kept me surprisingly warm! It looked very expensive. The stock photo doesn't really reflect how it looked on my so I included a side view. The back ruffles were my favorite part! I also have a very flat chest and the front ruffles gave me a nice feminine look. As for the fit... I am SUPER TINY on top. Barely AA cup size and narrow shoulders. This was still VERY tight! There was no give whatsoever in the fabric on top. I got the 4R which I guess is the equivalent to a 0 (?). It was fine for me but if you're on the fence about sizes, I'd suggest sizing up. My bottom half is athletic/curvy so the flowy fabric worked out well to balance everything out.","February 16, 2020","Small"

I got my package on time and it was easy to return. However, this was the first dress I have rented that I could not bring myself to wear to the event! I looked like Laura Ingalls Wilder meets Victoria Secret! I think it might have helped if I ordered it a size smaller so it was a little tighter. I also think it would look better on girls with a little tan to their skin color, it kind of washed me out. Definitely order a backup size.","January 8, 2020","True to Size"

I have a short torso and so the waist of the dress fell on a strange place on my body. This happens to me with a lot of dresses, so if you have an average waist, you should probably be fine. I also realized that the slit was way too high for a church wedding in which I had to walk up to the pulpit and do a reading.","December 10, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF39","RTR Customer","Felt comfy yet glam","This dress fit me beautifully and the leg slit (although pretty high) felt sexy without being trashy. The material is pretty light, so this is definitely a fall (not winter) dress unless you happen to live somewhere warm. The open section of the back was indeed a little more open than I anticipated, but I think my shoulders are slightly broader than average for my build, so most women would be fine. Normally I'd be nervous about not wearing a bra, but the fabric was just loose and light enough that I wasn't as self-conscious as I thought I'd be.

Also, it was cute but had two issues besides the zip situation: 1) not forgiving in the belly area. And 2) it was slightly long in the leg. From the pictures I thought I might be able to wear with a low heel but the legs were slightly too long. I'm 5'4"" and I probably needed a 3-3.5"" heel to make this work. Since I wanted to wear this for work, and I can't comfortably wear heels that high all day long, it didn't work for me.","January 16, 2020","Work"

It has a tight liner in it, so although the dress looks loose and flowy, it is not. I wear 16-18 and am a 38 DD, hourglass, and this fit, but my cleavage almost felt indecent. The plunge in the front required a plunge strapless. I ultimately had to use a plunge nude regular bra because the straps of the dress cut into my shoulders without that extra support.

I'm 5'4"" and the XS was a little bit long but wore tall heels and just lifted the dress up when I walked. The proportions of the dress still looked good and it didn't look too big or too long. I pulled the tie in the back tight, which helps shorten the dress, but could have used an XXS! Love the adjustability thanks to the tie back. There is a long wrap-style slit that goes up the side of the dress all the way to the waist, but a snap is built into the dress to help keep it closed.

Fit was boxy and not flattering. I liked the side slits that made it a little more interesting and the adjustable straps. The material said silk, but was not shiny at all, wrinkled very easily, had lots of loose threads, and showed every sign of sweat.

As a petite person I appreciated the adjustable straps. The fit is flowy but not too flowy, and the garnet color is beautiful. Cons: The silk material is extremely delicate and shows every single wrinkle, crease, drop of water, etc., so it likely would have to be cleaned and steamed often. I was seriously thinking about buying this but then not sure I want to deal with the dry cleaning bill (or environmental damage). Still a great rental though.","February 13, 2020","True to Size"

It was the top. See how there’s cups like a bra? If you at or over a D cup, your cuppeth will overflow. If you stuff them in, your bounty will stuff below the cup line and look odd from the side. It’s also hard to do the zipper by yourself, so make sure you can tag team it all night. Oh and one more thing, the zipper in the back at the bottom didn’t lay flat, giving the impression of a mini tail. Other than that, the material is nice and thick and has a shimmer. Definitely wear with heels since it makes shorter legs look even shorter.","February 21, 2020","Small"

The slit is almost too low to be appropriate for work, and the style of it is very off trend. The 70s print plus the tailoring of the dress was just not a good combo, in my opinion.

I'm usually a 6 and I wore a 2. Honestly could have fit into a 0 as the fabric is slightly stretchy. The straps were a little long but nothing that couldn't be fixed from sitting up straight which I supposed helped my slouching! I was a little nervous about the color at first as I didn't want it to be too white since I wore it to a wedding but the peach undercolor really stood out. I definitely received a lot of compliments!

However, when I wore it I think it worked out to my advantage it hung a little loose as I never had to pull or tug it (with the exception of making sure I sat up straight to keep the straps up). It really laid nicely and made me look tall and lean! Tons of compliments and the ruffles at the bottom gave it a romantic and classy look when I moved. Highly recommend and would rent again. Def size down. And for women with larger chest, I do agree with other reviews that it could be an issue but I'm a size A and got away with no bra but was a little nervous I would bend over and have a little exposure. But luckily no wardrobe malfunction!","July 29, 2019","Wedding"

Bust was very large (I am usually a C-D cup) but it had built-in wiring on the outside that was made for a smaller cup, so that part of the dress isn't great. But with the help of some double-sided tape, you can make it work. Non-adjustable straps did not bother me as much as it seemed to bother others.

I've been a size 8 as of lately (5'11"" 160lbs 34DDD) and the 6 was too big at the waist for me. It's a comfortable and stretchy dress but I did not like the bust. It has the built in cup lining on the outside that would probably fit a size B or C cup at best, and looked ridiculous on my DDDs. Instead of wearing this to the party Friday night, I wore it to brunch on Sunday with a white cardigan over it to hide the weird looking bust. This would look better on someone with a box frame and small bust.","July 12, 2019","Party"

The straps aren't adjustable either, so would occasionally slide off my shoulders.

Only complaint is, the straps kept falling down and in certain lighting; in some pictures the white shows up more than the peach. White made me nervous to wear to a wedding as a guest!

You'll see how hard it was to zip in back, but the fit was fine elsewhere and I do worry it may have been too baggy/bunched in the waist if I sized up, as it was already a bit bunched.

I absolutely love everything about this dress, it fit me better than my wedding dress did and I paid $800 in alterations for that dress. There is a corset in the top part of the dress that holds you in perfectly and accentuated what little waist I have. The asymmetrical hem was beyond cute, flirty, and fun. The flounce at the top and the sweetheart neckline was so flattering on me. It runs small so I sized up and it fit like a custom dress. I loved it.","February 10, 2020","Formal Affair"

It has great structure around the upper rib and chest area which increases confidence in dancing that it won't give any wardrobe malfunctions.

I paired with a statement necklace. Can't say enough about the dress!","September 8, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSK26","Lila","Dress is a showstopper","I opted for a 6 and an 8. The 8 was probably a better fit for me except the length. I chose to wear the 6 (with shapewear) bc the 8 bunches too much in the belly. I'm 5'5"" and the 8 probably would've been my size if I were 5'8"" or taller. My main issue with this dress was trying to wear it with shapewear. I must have gone to the Ladies 6 times in 4 hours to hike the dress up, twist it and pull it back down. It just kept migrating. The zipper is down the back but after 15-20 minutes (not just while dancing), it was on my hip. It wouldn't stay put. The dress is gorgeous, and I truly loved it and felt special, but it wouldn't stay put. Maybe the 8 would've done better, but it was too long in the torso and would've bunched so much that I was self conscious in that way.","September 5, 2019","Wedding"

I felt amazing in it and received a lot of compliments. However be aware that it has a corset top which squishes your breasts. I am 32 B and had to wear a strapless bra to not look completely flat. It did feel a bit tight in the chest. If you have size C and higher, order a size up.","September 5, 2019","True to Size"

This dress had every quality I was looking for and fit like a glove. I'm usually a size 2 but I'm glad I went with what the other reviews said and went up a size. Also, I wore spandex underneath because the tummy area is what you mainly notice besides the top so wanted a smoother look for sure. I would highly recommend getting a good pair of spanx. Everyone at the wedding loved the dress, definitely makes you stand out amongst the crowd. This dress was painful to return as I loved it so much.","August 29, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSK26","Marisa","Perfect for a summer wedding!","As soon as I put this dress on I felt amazing in it. I'm between a 6-8 since I have broad shoulders and the 8 ended up fitting like a glove-definitely true to size. I didn't need to wear a bra and it held up great all night. But if you hold your weight in your love handles and lower stomach like I do, the brace inside pushed right down on that area so just make sure you wear spanx. Other than that, I was completely obsessed with this dress and got so many compliments!","August 28, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSK26","Courtney","Stop shopping and order this dress!!","This dress turned heads - I have never received so many compliments! This is the first dress I was extremely excited to from RTR. The fit for me personally was true to size. It is ribbed at the top but still breathable and structural. I have small boobs, so I had no issues with the top portion. I have wider hips and this dress is PERFECT if you have curves. Extremely comfortable, great quality dress, and looks like it is off the runway.","August 26, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSK26","Kaile","Perfect balance of classiness with a fun flare!","This was my first time with RTR and it was everything I expected! The dress looked exactly like the photo and fit like a glove! I felt absolutely beautiful in it and I received so many complements. I love making statements with dresses I wear - this dress looked so bubbly and fun and I couldn't stop thinking about it once I saw it. I can see this dress being unforgiving if you don't get the proper size because the fitted style and boned corset can either do wonders or be really uncomfortable. Fortunately, the extra support fit me well and I was able to dance all night without having to pull it up. I was nervous about the size of the dress because other reviews mention it running small, however, I am normally a 6 and that size fit me perfectly. (Although I am tall and thin, I often have trouble finding a dress that is fitted around my narrow waist but fuller hips.. this was not a problem at all wearing this dress.) The only small inconvenience was the back seam had to be perfectly centered in order for the fabric not to bunch up oddly in the front. However, I am extremely picky and I do not think it was something big enough for other people to notice. Overall, perfect dress that made for the perfect night and I wouldn't change a thing! Amazing dress for my tall/long legged ladies!","August 19, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSK26","RTR Customer","The dress was beautiful and perfect for a June wedding.","I loved this dress. I ordered the 4 and the 6 but ended up wearing the 4 because it fit better and more snug. Usually strapless can be very annoying but this dress has boning in it the keep the top up all night long. Im about 135 pounds and only 5'1. Its hard to tell online but the dress is actually a pale pink with the red pattern which I loved. The dress has a 50's pinup vibe with the shape and style so it was something different than what everyone else is wearing at weddings. I would recommend this dress and wear it again!","August 16, 2019","True to Size"

The back zipper is impossible to zip up by yourself so make sure you have someone who can help you zip it up. It was super comfortable to wear without a bra, it just runs small so I'd recommend a size up and I wore it with spanx underneath. It made my butt look so good, I recommend for a wedding or other formal event! Material is on the thicker side so not good for outdoor events.","August 14, 2019","Other"

The color was a beautiful coppery brown that's really flattering. The peplum looks amazing on frames with narrow hips like mine. Super cute party top!! I found that the sequins did start to itch me a little around my chest but not under my arms. Also, the bust and waist were a little too loose on me even when the zipper fit my back/shoulders well.","April 1, 2020","Party"

It was comfortable and looked elegant. The neckline is beautiful (sleeves did slip off my shoulders a few times during the evening but it wasn't really an issue). I wore a strapless bra and it worked great. The blouse does have a cropped fit, so I paired it with high-waisted black dress pants and it looked awesome- but for a regular rise, be prepared to show some belly.","January 2, 2020","Party"

I was super comfortable in it but that was mainly because I had dark brown tights on. The dress was pretty short so I think I would be uncomfortable without something truly covering me if I accidentally bent over a bit too far. The small was a bit too large for me and at first the XS seemed a little too tight around my rib cage but it loosened up on me within minutes of wearing it.","January 14, 2020","Party"

It's a very nice understated leopard print -- a nice change since the leopard print is feeling overdone. The shoulders were a bit big on me but I think the M was necessary to zip over my bust.

For folks who are a size 0/2, this should fit just right in the waist, but I wished the tie in the back could be just a LITTLE tighter.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ANR79","Kristen","Flattering jumpsuit, great for curves","Rented as an option for my rehearsal dinner, but decided against it. This is a lovely jumpsuit, but did not fit my figure. I am an athletic shape, but I do have a decently defined waist and hips. The fit didn't really do much for my figure, but I bet curvier ladies would look great. There was plenty of room in the bust, and there was a modesty stitch to hold it together. At 5'7"" there was plenty of room in the crotch, which I often struggle with in jumpsuits. The wrap front was great for hiding any stomach concerns, however it made the hemline on the pants look uneven. No matter how I stood one pant leg was noticeably longer than the other. I was annoyed, but others might be fine with it. Material was on the thicker side - I could see darker colored undies through the material, but no panty lines. Fabric might not be the best for very warm and humid climates. Overall a nice garment, just not right for my body.","April 9, 2020","True to Size"

Was slightly panicked based on the reviews that it might run small especially since I've been on the heavier side of average lately... ironically this is the best fitting of the 4 items I ordered in my first RTR unlimited order.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/RHR12","Karla","Great daytime party dress that's forgiving!","This was my first experience with RTR. I found this dress in a boutique and didn't want to pay full price for a dress I knew I'd be wearing once for my own birthday party. I knew a small fit great from trying it on, but when it came time to order, small was sold out so I opted for an XS and backup M. The XS was the winner, since the M was too long and frumpy on my shorter frame. The only difference I noticed in the two sizes was the length and amount of fabric at the hem, so only size up or get your true size if you're super tall, otherwise I'd say size down. The rest of the dress is breezy and comfortable. If you want a form-fitting dress, this isn't it, but it's a great option if you want to be playful! Everyone absolutely loved it.","September 24, 2019","Large"

The material is heavy, but still stretchy and comfortable enough to dance in. It felt fresh and youthful compared to typical wedding attire. Husband and friends loved it. Would totally recommend.","September 8, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ELT77","Erin","Definitely a showstopper of a dress!","The color is absolutely as advertised — so bright. I ordered the size M, with L as my backup. Ideally, I would actually be between the two (I am a classic size 6) — I absolutely had to rely on Spanx for a cohesive silhouette with the M. The L gapped & hung too much to be wearable. It is low-cut, but I don’t have a large chest (34B) so it was a complete non-issue for me. The top stayed put all night with a LOT of dancing! The slit is not so high that I couldn’t wear mid-thigh-length Spanx underneath & I don’t think they showed. I usually fear a midi length for my thick calves (I am 5’6), but with high heels, this was perfect. Such a fun party dress — I recommend!","September 6, 2019","Small"

Almost more than the bride...oops! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","Size up if your hips are more than 10"" bigger than your waist! I go a medium but it was a tight fit and I was NOT taking long steps. This dress has a thick lining and is high quality so its quite warm despite being strapless. It looks great in person, and the cut is super feminine and is meant to emphasize an hourglass shape. 10/10, would buy and I will look at the other dresses from this designer <3.","August 27, 2019","Small"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/ELT77","Melissa","Great for curves!","This dress is perfect for the hourglass figure girls! It was form fitting without being tight - and the pattern accentuates your waist perfectly. I could have worn either the large or the XL - I'm typically an 8 in a dress that's fitted over the hips. The large would have worked but wouldn't have allowed for as much movement and comfort. I wore Spanx and a regular bra, but the material is thick, so you could go without the Spanx. One fit note: I'm a DD and this was still slightly baggy in the dress. Overall, I loved it and the colors were bright and perfect! A lot of compliments!","August 21, 2019","Wedding"

It is silk and the print is really flattering, picture doesn't do it justice. Loved the sleeves. It is a little tricky getting on and the zipper was a bit sticky. To prevent gaping in the chest I used double sided fabric tape and that worked out perfectly. I rented to have something special for Easter/wedding anniversary even though we were quarantining.

The arms were a little long for me, but I'm short, so most arm lengths are a little long for me... One note - the neckline is cut very low. I had to wear another shirt underneath it, as my bra would show if I didn't. I wore it to work with black pants, but it's probably a little too ""flashy"" for most work places - I think it would be better to wear to a party, or out for drinks/dinner.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JSK21","Lindsay","Fun summer piece","This dress is really fun. It's made of thin, breathable material-- perfect for Texas summer. The V neck is not quite as deep on me as on the model. I could wear a normal padded bra under it without the front showing, but I found it had enough support that I didn't have to. I'm a 32DD for reference, so finding a dress I can wear braless is usually difficult. Good support here. Ladies with a similar band size and slightly larger cup size could get away with it too. I think it would still be flattering on smaller-chested girls without the risk of a nip slip. The zipper is a bit tricky, so beware of the pinch. Unless you're standing against direct sunlight, the dress is not see-through. Of course, would still recommend wearing skin toned undergarments. I wore flesh-toned pasties just in case, but it probably wasn't necessary. I'm 5'7, and the dress hits me a little longer than mid thigh. It's tall girl friendly.

It is a bit on the thicker side as far as material is concerned. I love in Texas and this might be a little too thick for summertime. My legs felt like they were in the sauna! BUT, omg the cuteness level is too much. It's super flowy and fun to wear. I love the button detail on top, but had to make this work appropriate so I wore a plain white tee over and just tied it to give some shape. I was going to wear a jean jacket but it didn't give any shape and I looked like a tent. The white tee was perfect and actually way cuter. The spaghetti straps are a little thin and I found it kinda dig into my skin because the weight of the thick material. I didn't have to wear a bra because the material is so dang thick!

It is fitted at the top and flows beautifully at the bottom. The length was perfect for someone my height (5'4""). My only complaint is that it is a LOT of dress. The fabric is thick (but not hot) and there is a lot of it in the skirt. It's certainly not an issue, just something to keep in mind if you are shorter than 5'4"" as it may make going up and down the stairs a bit tricky.

The top is pretty low and the back part of the neck is loose, which lends the dress to being a little wide open going into the v of the front.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM635","Amy","Rented for a formal charity fundraiser. Ordered a size 20 and back up size 22.","The dress was horrible. It is not made for curvy girls at all. I wear an 18/20 so I went for the 20 and 22 just in case it ran small. It wasn't even close. From the waist down, it was like a sausage casing, it was awful to try and get on, and had little to no give. It was not forgiving, and not flattering at all. If you have hips, stay away from this dress. The top was fine in the size 20, but would require either a camisole or double sided tape or a whip stitch to close the wrap front. The top was way too big in the size 22, and the bottom was still a sausage casing, and not much better than the 20. I put both dresses right in the bag, and sent them both back next day. And tried to find something else in my closet that would do for the event I was attending.","March 12, 2020","Small"

There’s a string that ties by the skirt and controls how high or low the slit goes so it’s nice it’s adjustable.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SMY61","Lisa","TOTALLY FABULOUS","Omg these pants are the bomb dot com! As soon as I saw them I loved them, and once I put them on I loved them even more. So comfy, soft, stretchy, and slimming. What more could you want?! And this print goes with just about anything. I immediately went to the company’s website and bought a pair, THAT’S how much I love these! They are a tad long (which I love), so will need to wear moderate heels with these, which I’d want to do anyway for work. These are made of a light to medium weight fabric that can be worn year-round. Stretchy as they are (full elastic waistband), I gotta say I’m a little surprised the XL isn’t roomier. I’m 5’6, about 150 pounds, and normally wear M or L (8-10) in comparable styles, but these fit great. In any case, these are freakin’ awesome and my favorite thing from RTR thus far.","December 23, 2019","Small"

Definite seventies vibe, but look great. The only thing is that if you wear them high waisted, the elastic on the waistband sort of flips - not a dealbreaker but the only downside of these. Might be tougher for those who are very tall or long waisted, but a great pant. Considering keeping and buying!!","January 7, 2020","Everyday"

The draping on the front also makes it more comfortable. I was able to get away with the front slit given it was winter and wore this with black tights and black over the knee boots.

It's linen so it can wrinkle easily, but a few sprays of some wrinkle release spray does the trick.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CLUB19","Bonnie","Cute but straps were too long","First off, let me say that once you have this jumpsuit on it is incredibly comfortable. I wore it with a pair of slides and I felt like I was in PJs all day. Also, even though it's white, it's lined so you don't have to worry about it being see through. The problem was the straps, which were NONE ADJUSTABLE! When I put it on I wore a balconette bralette which should've been covered, but it kept showing. Since I didn't have anything else to wear, I had to shorten the straps by wrapping it around some bobby pins which then made the chest tighter as I had pulled the whole thing further up. Very cute and comfy, but would recommend it to people who can wear strapless bras or no bra.","June 5, 2019","Everyday"

However, I am very glad the only activity I had on the agenda for the evening was sitting/standing pretty (read: not a dancing dress for tall girls). The dress ran small to size, especially in regards to length. I typically wear a size is 6/8, but due to length of the body and sleeves on this dress I wore a 10.","November 14, 2019","Party"

If you're going to wear this, I'd think you'd have to skip underwear and just go with Spanx because it's also a very thin material. And I probably could've figured this out had I read the RTR description more closely but the fabric has a sheen to it that I think kind of cheapens this beautiful pattern.

I am 5’4”, 34C 130lbs. I did not have an issue with the straps being too long. I had them crossed in the back and I think that made all the difference. The only reason I did not get this five stars is because the top did not lay flat at the bust ( you could see the sticky strip that was supposed to lay flat against your chest ) and you cannot bend over in this.

I have a long torso, so it pulled a bit in the ahem, groin area, but that's par for the course for my body type in a romper and didn't render it unwearable. Felt hot!

The top was loose on me ( I'm a 34B now) and I wish I had rented the 4. But I made it work. Others also complain about the long straps....so here is my solution. I twisted them around each other (kinda like snakes lol) in the back a few times then hooked them forward in place. It shortened them enough and looked really cute from the back. I'm 5'2"" so I look short in everything but this romper was great. The fabric is lined and thicker which felt really good. The color is perfect.

These were the LONGEST straps in the history of straps. I wound up having to pin them and they still slid off a few times. This is a structured romper with boning, and as usual the boning was coming allll the way through the fabric underneath. I had a sharp thing sticking my stomach/rib cage area for two hours but it was worth it because this jumpsuit is so cute.

The material is silky and light, and the fit was perfect. I didn't wear a bra because the cut of the top was a little small for one. I could have easily worn sticky boobs though. But the material and cut off the top of the dress made it fine to go bra free. The large fit perfectly, and it was a nice length to mid-shin.

It was pretty long (like tea length) on my 5'2"" frame. It fit well, XS wasn't at all tight for me. I definitely needed a push up bra (32A) for the pretty peasant bodice to be as flattering as it could. This looked really gorgeous and it was such a fun dress to wear. Great for dressier summer events. Threw a denim jacket over this and kept it casual with sandals and a woven tote for brunch with friends.","September 9, 2019","Date"

I felt like the straps were a little too long on the large though. The straps come twisted which I think is a stylistic choice and why they are made a little longer.

It honestly fit like a corset but I didn't want to draw that much attention to my top half. I also had to pin the straps for a DIY alteration for better fit up top.

It had darker colors but still stood out with the embroidery and color. The flower buds are actually a light lilac. The material is on the stiffer end so that may affect your sizing.

The dress looked really cute online, and I love the colors and the pattern. (Disclaimer: I'm in my 40's - though people usually think I'm in my upper 30s.) Somehow it didn't quite work, and my husband thought the length and the skirt shape made it a bit matron-y. I'm not really big in the tummy area; I'm not completely flat either, but at 5'4"" and 114lbs it was a bit disconcerting to feel like my stomach was pronounced in this dress. I'm probably being self conscious though. If you're taller/younger, I would think this dress can be very cute. My waist is 26.5-27"" and I tried size 4. It was close but not overly tight. If you want to eat and be comfortable, you might want to size up. Mostly TTS.","March 16, 2020","Small"

I was also surprised the medium wouldn't fit, it wasn't super tight at the top clasp, I just don't think it was cut big enough for someone with boobs and a large rib cage. The straps were concerning-ly fragile and small but they did not break! The shape of this dress being straight/sheath may not have been the most flattering but I did not feel big at all!

That part was amazing. Had compliments all night long. Cons: I have to agree with the other reviewers when they say there is no stretch or give to the dress, especially in the mid section where I carry most of my weight. I ordered a L and an XL. Ended up wearing the L to the wedding.","September 16, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP52","Stefanie","Statement colors for a summer wedding","Loved the overall cut/fit of this dress, most importantly the pattern and color were so unique from typical dresses I have rented and worn before. It was great for a summer wedding and the midi length allowed it to be a little more formal. It hugged my figure in all the right spots. I am short but I didn't feel like it drowned me. The zipper was extremely difficult- I almost didn't wear it but was lucky to have someone help me. It's not so much because the dress was formfitting as it is the material (all lace- it was hard to even unzip from the hanger). I definitely recommend renting your normal size plus a size up for a back up. I ended up going with a small but probably would've had an easier time moving around with one size up. I was able to dance sit and walk just fine but it's not a dress that allows for a lot of free movement. Beware of using the bathroom- practice moving the dress beforehand or bring a friend :) Other than that I love this style and was happy with how I looked!","September 9, 2019","Wedding"

I wore nude stacked heels with fewer straps for less distraction, but I would wear again with higher black strap sandals for an edgier look. Rented a size 0 because it was the only one available and I was running out of time before trip departure.

I loved the pockets- I didn't carry a purse- just enough space for lipstick, my phone, and a card case for my ID/debit card. I thought the dress was going to be a brighter yellow, but it was more subdued which turned out to be nice, too. I have never worn a yellow dress but it went nice with my coloring, darker hair, and a lip with a pop of color. I love Kate Spade and every dress I have ordered from RTR that was designed by her company. Oh, and the dress has snaps in the shoulder area to keep your bra straps from showing- an added plus!","August 7, 2019","Wedding"

It's so beautiful and flattering, not to mention comfortable. Runs a little big, I'm a 4/6 and I could have prob gone with the 2 but the 4 was fine! I wore it 3 times and wish I could have kept it.

It was a huge wrinkly mess out of the bag. I steamed it, I ironed it some on the bottom, and it still bothered me bc it was so wrinkly. I also didn't think it was very flattering on my body type. The color wasn't the prettiest mustard yellow either. I think this dress would look better on darker skin and darker hair. I won't rent it again, but may work for others.","July 21, 2019","Everyday"

The top part of the dress is like wearing nothing, but the pleats and folds on the bottom give the dress the structure it needs for PERFECT swirls and twirls. 3. I have never received so many compliments. The ruffles are fun and the length is perfect for wearing flats if you're not someone who likes heels. 4. My only complaint...The color is a bit more of a mustard than a daffodil.

So beautifully made. Loved the color block and print mix. I thought the print would be a standard floral, but was happy to see it had a few surprise well manicured hands holding flowers mixed in - I am all about a sneaky print! 9 out of 10 people won't even notice that detail when you wear it. The pleats were perfect too! Pleats can go wonky and look awkward on me but these were just right, stayed smooth and didn't add bulk to my frame. It did run small. I have been a consistent US 6 in Three Floor, but had trouble zipping this one. I got it zipped up once, but the second time I put it on I couldn't get the last 2"" zipped. It was fine everywhere else, just the ribcage area gave me difficulty. There's no stretch either, so size up. Can't wait to wear it again when the world opens back up!

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SA146","RTR Customer","PERFECT for a Winter Wedding!","This dress was absolute perfection for a Winter wedding. Long sleeved but with an asymmetrical hemline for an added bit of flair to show a little leg. GORGEOUS emerald green color with a hint of metallic for dimension. I am 5'4 around 160lbs postpartum and wore a size 10. It was incredibly comfortable and lightweight (not a heavy material despite the velvety appearance of the fabric), sat right at the waist with the right amount of give so I didn't feel self conscious.

So if considering keep in mind that the shoulder pads sort of change the tone. I'm normally a 0,2 or 4 but only the 6 was available.

I am curvy so that's just how it goes. If you are curvy, size up. If you are slender, normal size probably will be fine. My husband loved this dress on me. I got compliments all night long.

Note that the stitching has gold thread running through it which gives the dress a bit of shimmer without being over the top.","November 5, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BAB2","Trudy","Beautiful dress, but runs very small","Gorgeous stitching, loved the look and quality was very nice. Definitely a show stopper, but dress under the sheer portion is very very short and overall ran very small.","March 19, 2020","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BAB2","Alex","MOST AMAZING DRESS","This dress was slightly different than what I'd usually rent for a wedding, but WOW i got so many compliments and the cut and quality of the dress was amazing. Its so much more beautiful in person than in photos, the embroidery is amazing. I felt sexy, but still appropriate and despite being slightly snug in the shoulders (no stretch) could still dance the night away. Would rent again.","March 9, 2020","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BAB2","Jenny","Beautiful, standout dress","Fit true to size. I have broad shoulders, typically avoid a sleeve of this style but the cap sleeve was not too form fitting and therefore worked well. Love the details of the dress, received many compliments. High quality, but the black slip does ride up. I read a review that said she wore black shorts underneath so I did the same and it was definitely the way to go!","March 1, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BAB2","Karin","Stunning, short liner","My sister ended up wearing this (5'6, 115#) and wore the XS. It fit her perfectly and was a gorgeous dress. The liner is super short, but with the shear outer piece it made the dress much more conservative and you couldn't tell the liner was short if you weren't the one wearing it. She might buy it because of how unique and gorgeous it looked on.","February 1, 2020","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BAB2","Kathryn","It would be a mistake to pass on this dress!","This dress is fantastic and the pictures online don't do it justice. The detail is amazing and it's beautiful on. It runs a little small through waist and the slip underneath is short. As a girl with thick thighs you have to watch it riding up but other than that it's an amazing dress. Compliments all night! Perfect for a wedding around the holidays. Rent this dress you won't regret it. No pics, sorry to busy dancing!","January 3, 2020","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM585","Vera","Fit like a glove!","I love the way badgley mischka fits, and this was no exception. I am on the tall side and this hit right at the knee. The color was a beautiful light purple and the fabric was a quality medium-weight fabric. I would have given it 5 stars, but the garment was pretty worn - the slit in the back was torn and the fabric showed signs of serious wear. Still happy I rented it, but RTR should probably take it out of the rotation fairly soon.","November 1, 2019","Work"

I typically would never pick something form fitting. I tried it on just to see and to my surprise, it was soo flattering! It hugged all of the right curves. It also felt like it holds you in but not in an uncomfortable way! Overall ever pleased with it!","September 26, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM585","Cristine","Structured & Cute ... but didn't work for me","I rented this dress in hopes to wear to a semi/formal wedding but unfortunately the sizing did not work out for me. There is NO stretch in this dress and my usual size 16 did not fit my tummy area. The size 18 fit but was too big in the hip area (I do not have hips lol). It fit my full best very well. The neckline is a little weird and the back / zipper felt a little high. I would have really loved to wear this dress, but the overall fit was not flattering for me.","July 25, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM585","Tali","Stunning power dress; great for important meetings!","This is a beautiful, classy, dare I say almost sexy dress. Wore it to an important meeting and I definitely felt more confidant in it. Pros: the neckline is gorgeous and creates a gorgeous line with the higher neck and the longer, fitted length. The cut is fitted but roomy enough for my big chest. My racer back bra worked well with it. And the color is so dang pretty for summer/spring. Cons: it is tight through the hips and thighs. I hate wearing smoothing undergarments but had to wear some medium compression. The color while gorgeous is unforgiving, especially in photos. It won't be the dress that makes you look ten lbs lighter but listen as a size 14, I'd rather wear a beautiful dress than always wear black.","July 22, 2019","Vacation"
