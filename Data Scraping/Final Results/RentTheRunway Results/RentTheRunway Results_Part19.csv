https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/CD33,RTR Customer,Gorgeous dress but terrible zipper,"First the pros: adjustable straps meant not having to wear a bra (I have a large chest and AWAYS have to worry about the bra situation), the length was a perfect tea length, it was comfortable material, and I got numerous compliments throughout the night. The cons: these dresses are well loved and therefore well worn. Definitely some wear and tear on the white lace top, although nothing too noticeable. The biggest issue I had with this dress, as other people had mentioned, was the zipper. I had ordered the 8 and the 10, and spent about 30 minutes with my mom and sister fussing over trying to get the zippers on either dress down - without me even in the dress. I think the 8 could have fit, but I opted to wear the 10 simply because we could not get the zipper on the 8 to work. I baffled how such a pricy dress can have such a terrible zipper!

The lace is beautiful and well made. The material is on the thick side which I enjoyed since it was my first formal affair after having a baby :). I didn't need to wear a bra which was nice. It was a little longer than I anticipated but it didn't matter. If my torso wasn't so broad I would have worn the 2 because it fit better on the bottom but there is no stretch so I couldn't make it work. Even though the 4 was a little big, it was still flattering. The zipper is horrendous. It had nothing to do with being tight because the dress wasn't at all. There was a plastic piece that would get caught when it would get to a certain point behind zipped up and if physically could not zip with that part stuck. Once I figured out that was he problem, it was easy to zip but I almost gave up on the dress. Glad I didn't.","June 16, 2018",Wedding

I think I could have gone down to a 2, which is my size for certain designers. The top did not fit as snug as I wanted but the straps helped and I used double sided fashion tape to hold down some of the flower fabric around the chest area. The side zipper is very difficult to zip up. Gets stuck just before the transition from the black to white (chest area). Overall, the dress was high quality fabric and the lace overlay was gorgeous.

Straps are adjustable and didn't need any undergarments for support. Larger chested women may.

I wore it for NYE from 7:00 till 2:00am and could have slept in it lol! I did have to use a bra strap expander thing (not sure of the technical term) so the bra did not show in the back.

The base is black but almost looks plum and the red, and hot pink embroidery is beautiful. It is a bit low-cut but still tasteful and the straps are adjustable so it's easy to go without a bra. They are a bit thin though, and slightly cut into you if you wear them too tight, but it wouldn't stop me from renting again.

I'm 5'6 and wore my tallest heels (3.5"") and the dress still brushed the floor. Had to hold it up while dancing. Unless you're very tall I would go with a regular length.

The fabric is smooth & soft & matte satiny but doesn't wrinkle too much. The color looks deep golden yellow in pics but it is more of a light terracotta.

https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP71,Melissa,"Its an ""ok"" dress","I am 5'4 and ~137lbs, I have hips, butt, and boobs and this dress was not the right one for me. Pro's - The slit was very high and I thought it was very sexy without going too far. I got a lot of ""Jessica Rabbit"" compliments. I would've given it 3 stars but the quality of the fabric and faded color bumped it to a 2. The design is pretty and this might be a comfortable dress if you have the right body type. Con's - I usually wear a size 4 but there was NO way that was zipping up over my hips or butt. The boning in the rib and chest area was formed really weird (the size 4 was not like that so I think it was just this dress) and it made it look like I had cone boob. The boning also goes down a couple inches (maybe 2?) from the cup area which was awkward. The dress is not vibrant red but more of a dull red like its been washed one too many times and the fabric quality also looked worn. The back is longer, like a train, which I thought I liked...until the material kept snagging on my heels which I spent all night trying to tug off. If it had just been smooth and not snagged I wouldve liked it much better. PSA there is ZERO give in this dress- NONE, NADDA, NIX! There is no give, stretch or negotiating with this dress, either your in it or your not and breathing due to the boning and fabric may or may not be be achievable. Also when you sit that slit goes alllll the way up to almost your hip so what kind of underwear will be a consideration when wearing this. If you have large boobs be prepared to spend the night pulling it up and readjusting, also the higher you pull it up to cover the girls the higher the slit goes.

The slit in the skirt was tasteful and not too revealing. For a chest size of 36B, the fabric in the bust area was perfectly supportive with no bra. It was easier to get someone else to zip up the back, but I'm sure it would have been possible to put on the dress by myself if I had exerted more effort. I wore this dress to a black tie optional gala, and it was lovely to be a bright red spot in a sea of black floor length dresses. During the banquet portion, I was definitely sitting a little straighter in my seat because the dress has enough body to it that you can't deep-couch-sit relax in it.

Not actually wearable, but it looked so stunning, my boyfriend was so impressed and had tons of compliments. There's no denying that the retail price is high for a reason.

I have a wide rib cage and larger chest, so I sized up and I am happy that I did. I could have worn a smaller size in the hips and waist, but with the slight stretch it still hugged my hips well and didn't look too big. The dress was very comfortable and easy to move and dance in.

I am 5'6"" and I think 1-2"" heels would've been ideal. I had to wear my wedges with 2.75"" heel bc of the grass and it felt a little short. My only complaint about the dress was the fact that the pink fabric sometimes didn't photograph well around my midsection - could be because I went for the larger size, so there was more fabric.

I am 5'4"", 145 lbs (on a good day) and kind of in shape but nothing crazy (gotta love the love handles). I wore a 6L (it was between that and a 10) and I was worried it was going to be too long but with 1 1/2"" heels, it was perfect. The hanger straps were the only annoying part to this dress; I wish someone would just cut them off already because I've seen other people complain as well. I did wear light beige Spanx shorts with this and they allowed me to feel extra sexy and secure in this dress (I did go commando). Highly recommend!","June 6, 2019",Wedding
https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JS99,Stacey,"Love, love, loved it! Classy, comfortable and colorful - so many compliments!","I loved this dress so much! The basic silhouette of the dress is very classy, but the notches at the shoulders and cutouts at the ribcage give it just enough edginess to be current and fun. I wore it to an evening MDW wedding, and the color was appropriate but also a standout. Got so many compliments! The dress was very comfortable, I wore it with a strapless bra, but you could probably find a racerback bra that worked too. It's hard to see the cutouts in the picture, but they are just at the right spot to be very flattering and just a bit sexy. My only complaint is that since the bottom part is lined (as it should be, with the light color), I got very warm out on the dance floor! Certainly a small price to pay for a beautiful dress and a very fun wedding. Beware that this got very wrinkled during shipping so definitely expect to spend some time ironing or steaming before you wear. Now for sizing details: I am 5'6"", 133lb, 34C - normally wear a size 2 or 4. Based on other reviews (thank you!), I was pretty confident that 4 was the right size, but wasn't sure about length. I ordered the 4R with 4L as my backup. Number size was pretty spot on - I probably could have gone down to the 2 in terms of fit through the waist (28"") and hips (35""), but the top would have been tight as I have a wider rib cage and shoulders. Turns out my height is smack dab in the middle of the length two ranges. The R perfectly skimmed the floor in bare feet, but the L was easily 4-5 inches longer - so any height heels in the R would make it awkwardly short, but I didn't want to wear 5"" heels all night to make the L work. Problem solved by buying a pair of cute bedazzled sandals to wear with the R, and being super comfortable all night!","May 30, 2019",True to Size

It's difficult to see in the picture, but the cut around the waist and hips created a strange framing of my lower stomach that made it look like I have a potbelly (this isn't normally an issue for me). As with many Saloni dresses, this one is cut very narrow at the waist, which may have contributed to the tummy-framing effect.

The halter neck angles at just the right spot for the shoulders to be the center of attention and the peplum with the velvet ribbon cinch at the waist and flare out in a gorgeous way. Specially for girls with more athletic and straight body types, this top will enhance your waist and make your hips seem a little wider and curvier. #flattering The so-so: The lining that they used for the halter neck is tulle which can be a bit scratchy at times. The bad: Zips all the way up in the back, so you might need some help closing the zipper. Fit: Comfort 8/10 Even thought this cinches at the waist, it doesn't cut in. There's still room to eat and sit down and breathe which is always appreciated. Stretch 0/10 Does not stretch. Order your true size.

The 4 fit my waist exactly, but wasn't as comfortable as the looser 6 would've been. Everyone who saw this loved it though. The only 2 issues I had with it is that, like most designer garments, the zipper isn't heavy duty but it almost always has to go over a thick seam somewhere, which made it very had to pull up, especially I if it's in the back & you aren't especially bendy like I am!

The detail on the bodice also was lovely and didn't add any extra bulk. Also if you don't have a booty this will do wonders for you. I love the color, the fabric felt expensive and it wasn't boring compared to all the other sparkly NYE dresses. Do yourself a favor and rent it. You will not regret it.","January 2, 2019",Party

I'm 5'8"", like 155, 34A, more pear shaped, and it felt a bit too big up top at first, but I got used to it. Overall very comfortable and allows for stretch. No-show underwear was fine, didn't need a thong. Hits about mid-thigh. However, it did feel like when you wear a pair of leggings too many times and need to tighten them up in the dryer. (unsure if that's just how the fabric is, or the nature of how RTR works with people wearing it a bunch) It wasn't super baggy, but I should have tried the small as my backup size instead of the large.

As others have noted it can be worn backwards for more of a traditional/v-neck look but I think the straight up and down cut of the dress is really a key part of its design and the straight-across boat neck plays to that. The shape isn’t normatively flattering per se but it’s super chic. The fabric is extremely light/thin for a sweater dress, so it will work for summer, even hot weather probably. It also is a little clingy in terms of panty-lines though so it works with tights on that level, and looks good with boots.

I'm not usually a cleavage queen (I'm more of a Diane Keaton turtleneck in the summer type of gal) but I wanted to go for it at my last grad school function, and go for it I did. This dress was definitely a head-turner--if you're larger than a B, and looking to live your wallflower fantasy for the evening, this ain't it. With that in mind, I think this dress would be especially appropriate for an ex or frenemy's wedding. The color is gorgeous--more burnt orange or terra cotta red than the photo reflects--and is a fun, slightly boho alternative to the navy, black, red, and metallic gowns that tend to populate formal events. As far as fit goes, I didn't feel the need to use boob tape (as an avowed prude, I am not shy with the double-stick), and found that the dress hid shapewear very well. The length was great. I was about 5'8"" (5'4""-ish in 3.5"" or so heels), and the hem neither dragged nor showed my shoes. Overall, great dress. Would recommend.","June 6, 2019",True to Size

It wasn't too long, the straps are adjustable which is super accommodating to all bust sized. This dress actually gave me cleavage for the first time in my life lol.

I got stopped by so many strangers (mostly women) complimenting me on the dress. One even touched it as she walked past me! The skirt is fun and flows, which I adore. Also, the skirt has red piping in the pleats, which I didn't notice in the photos. When I first received the dress I was surprised but I found myself loving the dress even more because of it. Things to note: the dress fits true to size. I'm usually a size 4 or 6 and went with the medium. It fit me very nicely but a small probably could have worked too. I was very happy with the medium. The belt is sewn onto the dress. You can still cinch it, but it's a little odd at first. Especially since the zipper has to go through the belt. And the zipper is TOUGH! You will definitely need assistance in and out of this thing, but it's totally worth it! I wore a standard bra and had no issues. Take a chance on this gorgeous, one-of-a-kind dress.

Also as other reviewer mentioned, opening of the arm area is big so it'll show a part of your bras (see my pic).

It’s made of polyester and spandex, so if you accidentally spill on it, just dab a little soap and water on it and let it air dry. That’s a huge plus, in my book. Most formal dresses will show water spots. The only thing that I didn’t like about it is that the rubber strip at the top of the bust that helps the dress hug your body and stay up was visible to others.
