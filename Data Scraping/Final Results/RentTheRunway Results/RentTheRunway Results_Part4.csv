I think it's best to order Long if you plan to wear heels. Luckily, I was wearing slippers because this was #stayhome event during the pandemic; the length was perfect. Buttons at the back of the neck were too tricky for me to do on my own.","April 10, 2020","Formal Affair"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL94","Lauren","Couldn't wear the dress as event was cancelled :(","Couldn't wear the dress unfortunately, as the wedding was cancelled due to Coronavirus :( The dress was a bit big on me (size 6R) so for my measurements I think I would've fit better in a 4R. I'm not wearing any shoes in the picture and I'm 5' 4"" so would've needed some heels for sure. I liked the style and it seemed very comfortable. The coloring is pretty, nice vibrant pink and does have some stretch. As the style is definitely unique, I'd just make sure its appropriate for the function, but overall very pretty!","April 8, 2020","True to Size"

The color and style of this dress captured my eyes while looking online, and then exceeded my expectations the moment I slipped it on. The material is light weight, and flowy ... perfect for dancing the night away. I received so many compliments throughout the evening, and afterwards in photos.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL94","Alex","FABULOUS!","This is one of the best dresses I've ever rented! The hot-pink is gorgeous. The cut-out is in just the right spot: it nips in at the natural waist and is mostly around to the back, so it's very flattering. The one-shoulder/collar/cape combo is glamorous and fun. The skirt is forgiving for larger hips, and it drapes beautifully - not clingy at all. I am 5ft-6in tall, and I wore it with 4in heels. It just grazed the floor, wasn't too long or too short. Seriously, a fabulous dress. I wish I had more occasions to wear it!","February 11, 2020","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL94","RTR Customer","I wore this to a Ball.","The dress was very comfortable, petite fit was fine with 1 1/2"" and 2 "" heels. I did not trip over the dress at all. It is forgiving after a meal and you can dance easily in it. The color is beautiful. I wore stick on silicone bra with a center clasp and would recommend this for ladies with larger chest. Silver or Gold accessories work with this. I wore the 2 petite not the 0 petite. The O petite wasn't even a close fit (way too tight). I'm 5' tall and 115lb. 34C. If your chest is bigger than a 34C I would not try a 2P, move up a size.","February 10, 2020","True to Size"

Unfortunately, I was unimpressed by this dress. The color is not a deep rich pink--it is hot pink. Like....Legally Blonde hot pink. While I am a 6L, the 8L fit only slightly large. The length was great. It just wasn't very mature looking. It would be great for a prom dress, but not well suited for anyone over about 22.","January 11, 2020","Formal Affair"

The pictures were very accurate in terms of the length of the pants and draping up top. This was my first time in a jumpsuit and basically all my fears were realized: it was weirdly long in the crotch (lots of extra fabric there) and you should just plan not to use the bathroom because getting in and out of it was definitely not the easiest (two zippers, three buttons). Paired it with red pumps and gold jewelry and I looked fine but wasn't too sad to see this go back.","February 25, 2020","True to Size"

It was also weirdly static-y and no matter what I did, never went away. I worry that as more people rent this, it won't hold up to continuous wear.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FAV4","Madeleine","Favorite dress ever!!","This dress fit like a glove, I accidentally caught my skin on the zipper when I first tried it on, but it was avoided on the day of. The dress has built in padding so no bra required. The fabric is soft and it flows beautifully. It has two layers of a silk-like fabric under the top layer of fabric, so it's slightly weighted but it felt good! Heels were worn, I'd say they were about 2 in, maybe 2 1/2 in. The fabric was just high enough off the ground. Loved this dress so much!!!","March 22, 2020","Wedding"

I'm typically a 4-6R, and even the 8R was too tight within my rib cage to wear. I lasted a whole ten minutes in it before I had to remove it. Disappointed I was unable to wear it for the event, I wish there had been a recommendation to size up well beyond my standard size.

I rented this dress from Hah and it ended up being so perfect for our small, outdoor mountain ceremony. The dress is really stretchy/form fitting so I recommend sizing up if you plan on eating/want it to fit less skin tight.

I'm a pretty standard size 2 and this was so loose in the shoulders and bust that the sleeves just fell down (it's a square neck so it's NOT a cute look) & the elasticized waist was loose.

So flattering and so sexy; my husband LOVED it. I could have gone with a size 4 and would have been happy.

I was a little nervous because since I'm a bit bustier, I typically size up for fitted clothing like this. My larger backup size wasn't available though, so I had to take the risk and hope my true size would fit. It fit like a glove. Even the length was perfect. They don't offer this jumpsuit in petite lengths, so I was fully prepared for this to be too long, but it cut right at my ankle where it was supposed to and looked fantastic. My only gripe is RTR is now 3 for 3 on messing up my order this year. My first two orders of the year just never made it to me, period. I paid for the 8-day rental on this jumpsuit so I could have it before I left for NYE, and not only did they not have my backup size available, but this got delayed in shipping and ended up getting to me literally as I walked out the door to head for my vacation.

I think others mentioned the straps being too long, if I had pinned them that might have helped but they weren't as long on me to where they were slipping off. The cutouts on the side were fun. Great material, comfortable enough in it to do some karaoke leg kicks! Downside: the zipper gets a bit stuck around the belting so I needed help to get it on and off every bathroom trip. Worth it!","August 21, 2019","True to Size"

If it weren't for the straps, it would have been 5 stars, because it's a gorgeous piece! I still highly recommend renting if you don't mind maybe doing a quick fix on the straps before your event.","August 17, 2019","Other"

The legs were snug but doable even with a curvy booty and thighs. The backup size 10 the pants part wasn't much bigger and the rib cage was too big, so the 8 was better for me. I am a 34B and wore a black lace push-up bra underneath and safetypinned the straps a bit. The pants were ankle length.

I would have had to shorten the straps and tape the chest down to comfortably wear this. Instead I went with the size 4, which I had to squeeze into a little bit. The straps and chest fit perfectly, but it was tight in the thighs and hips. Most of the fabric gives a little so it wasn't too bad. However, I ate enough for dinner that I was very uncomfortable afterwards, since the lace had no give. I walked home half unzipped so I could breathe. Up until that point I really enjoyed this. It was a fun jumpsuit that could be dressed up or down. I'd wear it again if it had fit better.","June 11, 2019","Large"

However, it is a stretchy garment and if you are between sizes, I would go down. Some spanx and two girlfriends to zip you in should do it. I've never received so many compliments! I'm 5'4 139 pounds and the small fit perfectly. Now to the most important part: I wore a regular bra! I HATE strapless bras, and any cocktail dress where I can wear a regular bra is a win in my book. I highly recommend this dress, I felt like a movie star and frankly didn't want to send it back.","February 10, 2020","True to Size"

The size 6 I received was a little damaged (I let the customer service know), but the 4 was actually a better fit. I would have rather had it shorter but the L size was the only one left in that size. I really loved this dress a lot and the colors were awesome!

It did hit the floor in the back but it looked like a dramatic train. The fabric is so light, it flows out beautifully behind you when you walk. The one downfall is that it definitely fell down through the night. Never to the point where I felt exposed but the only strapless bra I own is white and it definitely showed in some pictures.

It could be worn to work if you're going out for drinks later, worn to a party, and popped out for any semi or very special occasion. It is pretty fussy to put on. There are lots of fabric covered buttons with fabric loops and the metallic threads make the fabric on fabric pretty hard to button. I wouldn't have been deterred by this - I had honestly planned to buy this dress. Unfortunately I have very rosy cool toned skin and the gold was far too gold for me so I had to put her back into the ocean for some other lucky person to catch.","May 1, 2020","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PATU3","Rachel","Direct from the runway with the measurements for a runway model","The fabric is as fine as a Hermes scarf and skims over a body like a cloud. The problem is the cut is for a woman with a body built for the runway. I am 5'4"" and a natural 32DD which permits some flexibility but the bust seam should be two-inches lower. The bodice won't work with implants larger than a B-cup because the cut and fabric won't adjust. The length is to the floor if you aren't at least 5'6"". Try pushing the sleeve cuff up as I did which makes the sleeve more architectural.","April 30, 2020","Everyday"

So I did size up. There's no stretch in the fabric as other reviewer's have noted which makes it very hard to raise your arms over your head if it's fitted the way it is on me in the pic.

It was -Extremely-difficult to get into the top half of this dress (sized up one size!) to where I thought at one point it may be impossible, (and I have a flat chest and wear XS tops!)

The top has an odd fit and I don't know if someone with an larger chest could wear it. It was a little loose on me (I'm a 34A) and low cut but could have managed with a little fashion tape. But it was then tight right under the bust line. But the deal breaker was the length. This dress is LONG. I thought it would be more midi length but even with heels it was dragging on the floor a bit. I'm 5'6"". Sadly this just won't work for me.","March 10, 2020","Other"

One thing that I need to point out is there is no slit in the back! It forces you to shorten your steps and while it wouldn't deter me from renting it again, because I will, it certainly takes some getting used to!

Recommend ordering a second free size.","At first I was unsure about which size to order because of the reviews, but I decided to order the XS with the Small back-up because it was free, so why not - I’m so glad that I did! The XS skirt was a little loose, I ended up pinning it to fit me and it worked perfectly because the patterns and amazing built-in pocket give wiggle room to make it look like a custom fit. Both the XS and Small top fit - XS was a tighter fit so I ended up wearing the Small which gave me a fuller bust with the built in padding. The dupatta was perfect and so soft.

I typically and between a medium and large but large was the only one available and I'm glad I got the large because the slit is really high.

The dress is a perfect combination of feminine frills & sex appeal with the thigh high split.

You will need fashion tape if you don't mind how exposed your chest will be ...or a safety pin if you don't want your chest exposed at all. Besides that the dress is very lightweight and flow-y.

As a warning, the chest area can be tight and if you're chesty it might be very low cut. Used a lot of double sided tape! Also is slightly high low but in a very tasteful way!

It had a few loose threads coming off of the embroidered flowers but it was almost not noticeable because the dress is so colorful and busy in the first place. I usually wear XS or S, or size 2, and size 2 in this dress fit perfectly. However, if you are busty, you might go for a size 4 since I am a 36 A in bras.","December 31, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/VNE11","Ariel","Gorgeous color - not so sure about the fabric.","I rented this dress for work purely for the color - I'm a sucker for any form of pumpkin orange! Seeing it in-person had me even more excited - it's exactly the same color as the photo! The neckline is super interesting and the tie at the waist was a great touch - it helped keep everything cinched in nicely. The zipper is a little snug at the armpit, but nothing too unbearable. The only qualm I had with this piece was the fabric quality. It was soft and didn't wrinkle on my commute, but it really screamed ""bridal party"" rather than ""designer"" - if that makes sense. That being said, I think it would work great for a wedding or other special occasion.","November 14, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KPL75","Christa","Perfect Spring/Summer dress","I rented the 0R which fits like an Xs or a 0/2. The bodice is pretty fitted so if your busty you might want to size up. I weigh 122-124 lbs with all the weight in my lower body. I have a slim rib cage and no fat what so ever in my upper body. I measure 35-25-37. I wear a 32D or 32DD depending. I would recommend the OR size only to people with a 32 band and a bust size C or smaller. This is a beautiful breezy light weight dress perfect for summer. The bottom is lined but the top isn't so keep that in mind. You won't be able to wear this bra less because of the sheerness of the top and the holes in the lace. Sorry about the red bra I'm wearing here (that's what I had on when I tried this on,I would wear a nude bra if I was leaving the house). Very pretty dress.

I walked into the party and everyone swiveled to take in my nearly head to toe sequins. I felt so effervescent I this dress, and the little skits on the side made me feel just sexy enough. Tons of compliments and the sequins perked everyone up. The dress has black undertones so I would recommend black shoes rather than silver. The dress is very well made (lined) and has no stretch. Even without the stretch it fit my big girls properly. Great for hourglass figures!","December 16, 2019","Party"

The colors on this dress are so striking, and I felt like unbuttoning the bottom to let a little leg peak out for nighttime.

However the pants have a surprising amount of stretch in the legs and hip but no stretch on the actual waistband, making for a weird fit. They will not pull you in at all in the hip or thigh. I opted to hike them way up and leave the zipper undone a bit vs. sizing up and having the thighs look baggy. However, if you have a flat stomach and are pairing these with a long shirt or sweater, get your true size and you'll probably be fine. High quality. lightweight - not heavy.

Any stick on bra that doesn't have a front closure would work though. The three slits run pretty high but a pair of opaque black tights keeps the look from being too revealing. The sleeves are wide enough for women who have bigger arms and typically struggle to find dresses that fit them.

This dress fit everywhere except in the chest/shoulder area. It would have been perfect if I could take binder clips to the top of the dress (where the dress sits on top of your shoulders/collarbone area) to pull the dress up about an inch on each side to keep my chest from falling out of the dress. I don't think I could have sized down as it fit me perfectly around my ribs and through my arms - and the slits were already very high as it was so a shorter dress would have exposed all sorts of things. I maybe could have worn a bralette underneath but it is very, very low-cut and so I think even the bottom of the bralette would have been exposed. Plus, it still would have been noticeably gaping so not really sure a bralette or cami would would have worked that well. I wore this dress for all of 3 hours and that was all I could handle. Otherwise, the dress was beautiful and a great color. I just don't think my chest was large enough to fill it out.","November 5, 2019","Large"

The dress fit fine in the hips, arms, even the waist, but would not button at all over my chest, not even close (so bad I couldn't even take photo to show you).

The waist for perfect in the size 16R, bit the top was a smidge loose though I wasn't wearing a bra - that might have helped.

Short girls beware, though! I'm 5'3"" and if I hadn't worn heels, the bottom of the dress would've been toast.

The size 8 fit perfectly but because of my height (6'2"") the straps weren't long enough and they were way too tight so I went with the 10.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL252","Candace","Stunning dress! So many compliments!","This dress is gorgeous! Some reviews about the bones said they were uncomfortable but I didn’t find it uncomfortable at all. The under skirt provided plenty of coverage and didn’t rise on me which is hard to find because I’m curvy! I wore a strapless bra but I think I could have gotten away with not wearing but I liked the extra coverage. My only complaint is that it was a little long on me and my stiletto heels kept catching on the dress when I walked but I just held it a bit which was a little annoying. Looking back I would have worn different shoes. I would recommend walking in the dress and shoes around the house if you’re short to make sure the shoes won’t catch on the dress. Other than that no complaints and I would definitely rent again! I’m 5’2 138 lbs for reference and ordered a size 6 which fit perfect!","September 19, 2019","True to Size"

I would recommend ordering this a little in advance. When I went to pick it up, the woman told me that this dress can be hard to get because everyone wants it!","September 18, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL252","Alana","Beautiful, but painful!","This dress is absolutely gorgeous, the type of dress where random strangers in NYC stop you and tell you how good you look! It is flattering and I felt confident and beautiful! The embroidery is breathtaking (much more beautiful is real life) and the colors were so much fun to play with. I did a red lip and yellow nails and it all pulled together perfectly! However, I was in this dress from 2PM until 2AM, and by the end of the night the boning in the sides of the dress had rubbed me raw! I would definitely recommend trying in your size and the next size up to avoid the pain of the sides of the dress. Unfortunately, the next size up was not available, so I just dealt with the pain. I am only taking away 1 star because I still loved the dress and am glad I rented it, even though there is residual pan!","September 10, 2019","Small"

Ruching was super flattering to the stomach, but was a little baggier down lower by the crotch. I couldn't tell if this was because the fit had loosened because I'd been dancing for a while in a packed (i.e. hot) area, or if it meant I should have ordered the Size 4. (Honestly though, I don't think I would've been able to zip a Size 4 up over me lol, and if I had been able to, it likely would've been too short/skimming my butt).","January 27, 2020","True to Size"

Running true to size, I recommend sizing down as a backup (especially for short girls - I'm 5'3"" - as this looked more like a maxi than a midi on me - loved it just the same). With a deep V you might want to use fashion tape to keep yourself in place although I don't think it's a necessity (I didn't). The top fit nicely and the puff sleeve had an elastic at the end to keep its shape. The waist down was very airy and comfortable. I styled it with black heed mules and simple jewelry to let the dress speak for itself! I wore this dress to a summer party and got tons of compliments - will rent again!","August 1, 2019","True to Size"

It's wayy too low cut, and there's not enough fabric to tie it tighter and make it work. Not even in a sexy boobalicious way, it was just totally impractical.

Luckily the material was stretchy and gave a bit,and actually comfortable, but I would have liked to have tried an 8- not a normal size for me. It was too late and the weekend, to get a replacement. The material helped hide areas most are self conscious about- stomach & butt. I wore with black heels and dazzly/dangly earrings- no other jewelry - and got many compliments.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM398","Tasmin","Loved this dress, on the shorter side","I ended up wearing this dress about 5 times but somehow forgot to take a pic every time. Overall a cute dress! The material is a little more durable than I expected. I will note that the dress is on the slightly shorter side and the zip on the front side of the leg tends to come undone very easily so expect to wear this with tights in most situations. It fit well on my larger bust and I could comfortably wear it without a shaper","February 16, 2020","Everyday"

A little baggy around the mid section but I think if I sized down it would be too short. Love the zipper detail at the bottom. Wore with a more fitted leather jacket to help with the shapelessness. Would rent again.","January 8, 2020","Other"

The shape is stylish and classy and the eye motif adds a playful element. I paired with chunky yellow heels.","January 3, 2020","Work"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM398","Angela","Versatile!","Contemplating keeping this. It's a very versatile piece. Runs a bit big, but not unwearable. I have unzipped it all the way and worn it as a shirt over boyfriend jeans with chunky boots. I've also worn it as a dress with tights and a black turtleneck underneath. Love it.","December 9, 2019","Everyday"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM398","RTR Customer","Weirdest size dress","I don't think you can see it in the pictures but there's a seem across the waist that cinches this dress in. I thought it would look good or fit like a mumu since I have wide hips but it was really large on top and too narrow on the hips. Really bazaar sizing for such a cute dress.","November 27, 2019","True to Size"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM398","Elizabeth","so cute!","This is an amazing dress! It runs TTS. It is a little big through the chest, but I think this is the intended cut. I rented it for my birthday next week. Looks great with tights and boots.","November 9, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM398","Kimberly","Beautiful and unique","I received compliments galore for the evil eye dress! The stitching that creates the eyes is beautifully detailed with rich, vibrant colors. The rest of the dress is thickly-lined and well made. I'm usually a size M/6/8 in dresses, and the M size in this dress gave me a roomy fit. I could have sized down, but I liked how the M allowed for a boxy look. And, it was very comfortable to wear all day. I paired it with tights and velvet booties (both in a wine color), and loved the entire look. Highly recommend this dress for work, parties, dinner, whatever. It will look great anywhere.","October 25, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/NM398","Carolina","Interesting, fun dress.","It's a nice shift, good drop-waist fit. The Evil Eye makes it interesting. It' s hair on the short side for bare legs-- I would recommend wearing with black tights, and maybe boots. Will definitely rent again.","October 1, 2019","True to Size"
