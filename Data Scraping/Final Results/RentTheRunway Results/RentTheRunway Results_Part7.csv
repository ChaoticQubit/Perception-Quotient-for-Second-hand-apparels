"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG153","Nari","Showstopper of a dress","Absolutely stunning dress. The fabric is thin but not flimsy, with the nude liner stitched to the leopard print. It's styled as a wrap dress but isn't and has a zipper in the back. The fabric has no give at all but the fit is generous everywhere except right under the bust, where the zipper comes together. Having said that, I typically wear a 4 but sized down to a 2, which fit comfortably (I'm a 32B in the chest).","April 29, 2020","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JG153","Amy","Great dress!!!","I absolutely loved this dress! There is a thigh high slit and it was cold outside for an outdoor wedding in October so I wore over the knee Jeffrey Campbell boots and a fun cropped sweater (seen in pic). I also rented a cute crop light pink jacket from RTR to go with it! Everyone loved the outfit. The back fits so well it is open with spaghetti crisscross straps. Sometimes these sort of designs don't fit me because I have an athletic shoulder build and larger bust, but this one was perfect!!","April 17, 2020","Party"

I'm large chested and solid build, wear a size 4 pants and a small or medium top, but since it's a lower cut I sized up big time knowing boobs are normally an issue. I wore the 10 but probably could have gotten away with the 8, however it would have been too short. Got so many compliments on it and felt sexy and fun but still comfortable in it!

I have a small chest & did not wear a bra because the back of this dress off backless. When sitting down, the dress opens up like wrap dresses do. It makes all of your legs show. I had on nude color spanx shorts. That made the dress more comfortable when I was sitting, I didn't want to chance flashing anyone! This is a fun, lightweight, sexy dress. I recommend it.","December 30, 2019","Party"

I'm normally a size 4 and dress was true to size. It has no stretch and like the other comments, the waist was snug. If your waist is more than 27"", I recommend sizing up to a 6. I'm a 27"" and the waist was snug but not uncomfortable. Length was perfect for 3"" heels. Would definitely wear the dress again!","December 1, 2019","Wedding"

Im not petite but that was the only size they had available, a regular fit would've been better I think. No need to wear a bra for me but you can also do NuBra, i dont think a regular bra could work because the back is low.","October 19, 2019","Wedding"

Everything about this dress was gorgeous that I really wanted to keep it. I struggle with length in maxi dresses but I was able to comfortably wear flats without it looking too long. You can Dress it up or down and versatile for day or night. Material was light and not as formal as the photo may look.","September 18, 2019","Date"

I did have to wear pretty tall shoes, but didn't need any temporary hemming with fashion tape, which never happens to me with a maxi!! The dress also has a very sexy slit up the front (more like a wrap dress slit, so off to the side) - so it's easy to walk, not too restricting. I was able to go comfortably braless with the 0P and the straps were perfect (not too loose or falling down) - larger chests may want to size up.","September 11, 2019","Vacation"

The hips were a little tight, if you are in between a size definitely go up. I;m 5'4 and wore 3 inch heels and the dress was LONG (only a long available) So it will work for tall girls too. Two complaints that did not affect my evening at all - the slit is annoying to sit with and walk fast, and the bunching of fabric where it wraps at the waist isn't forgiving in photos.

Was able to wear my regular XS even though 13 weeks pregnant with a little bump. If wearing further in pregnancy would of definitely needed to size up to a S for more comfortable fit, but S too big currently.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LP120","Mallory","Beautiful Baby Shower Dress","I wore this dress for my baby shower at 28 weeks. The medium fit just right, if not slightly tight in the chest. Though, I didn't mind it being tight in the chest because that meant I didn't have to worry about anything popping out that I didn't want seen. The dress hit right at my ankles, though at 5'10"" that didn't surprise me. I got a lot of complements and felt comfortable the whole time. Highly recommend!","August 29, 2019","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LP120","Katie","My favorite RTR yet!","This is the first RTR rental that I have ever taken out of the bag and put on and said ""YES this fits PERFECTLY!"" I rented this for my baby shower at 26 weeks pregnant. I'm 5'5"" and wore a medium, and the length was perfect with flats. This was the most comfortable dress ever, perfectly appropriate for my tea party baby shower. The fabric is stretchy, and light/breathable and flowy which was perfect for a Mid-Atlantic 85 degree August day. It accommodated the bump comfortably, and I could have worn it later in the pregnancy, too, I'm sure. It was not clingy, it was not hot, it was not see through. The colors are vibrant and beautiful with even some blush/pink tones throughout. Some reviews say this dress is too casual, which is true if you're trying to wear it to a formal wedding, but if you're going to a Spring or Summer daytime party it's perfect! I got a ton of compliments. It's a flattering fit (and honestly I'd rent it even if I wasn't pregnant). You can wear a normal bra with it too! It has the potential to be revealing in the front but I was able to fix that without even using fashion tape. The shoulders have the loops on the inside that fasten to your bra strap and I just positioned them far enough back on the strap and it held the front in place so it didn't show my bra. I did not want to give this dress back! In this dress I felt like I looked good and I felt confident- so important when it's an event where all eyes are on you. I hope RTR carries more like this style because it was seriously the most comfortable rental I've ever received.","August 12, 2019","Party"

I usually wear an XS/S in Lilly pre-pregnancy and weigh 114ish. In the third trimester I weight 140 and this worked perfectly. Band is tight on the upper waist, but not uncomfortable. A bigger size may have been too big in the arms/chest. Perfect for a baby shower.","August 5, 2019","Party"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LP120","Erica","Perfect for pregos","Loved this dress so much. I wore the size M at 36 weeks pregnant (I'm a s/xs not pregnant in Lilly dresses) so the sizing is generous. Stretchy but thicker material and easy to wear a normal bra.

I got so many compliments and was so sad to return it. My pre-pregnancy weight is 145 so I think a medium would've fit if I hadn't been pregnant. I ordered the XLR as a back up size but I think that would've been much too large. It runs big/looser in the chest and sleeves. But it's a very comfortable dress, and a regular pair of wedges made the length doable. No tripping or holding the dress up. I would 100% order it again.","May 15, 2019","Party"

When I first tried on the dress, the one of the boning pieces in the bodice was noticeably digging into my waist. But atlas the first the first dress didn't suffice so backup dress it was. I stuffed the boning back in the seam when I could but it generally did come out throughout the night. Not sure if it was my specific dress or the actual dress design in general.

The off - shoulder detail felt so feminine and sexy, especially with a modest tea-length hem. I paired it with a pop of red handbag and pearls for a retro yet timeless ensemble. It was so much fun to dance in :) the shoulders are really snug and you can untie the bows on the shoulder completely to get it at just the right height and fit for you.","October 7, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL51","RTR Customer","The most compliments I've ever received from a RTR dress","The Good: The fabric is thick and stretchy so it holds really well and does not wrinkle. I packed this for a trip and it was perfect for the occasion. The ties on the arm are adjustable so you can loosen them to drop lower on the arm as I did or tie them tighter if you prefer to wear them on your shoulders. The disclaimer: I'm short (5'2"") so the dress on me was tea length. For a wedding at night, it was perfect.. but the longer length for a day dress might pose a problem for other shorties if you plan to use it for a more casual setting. The Bad: it has boning built which holds the shape beautifully, but unfortunately it was popping thru the inside of the dress so it was poking me all night long and became super uncomfortable. If I had owned the dress, I would have either added fabrid to re-seal the top and bottom of the boning to secure it in place, or removed it all together... Aws more people rent this.. its going to get worse with wear... spanx that were high wasted saved me the night I wore it!!","October 5, 2018","Large"

The wire/plastic bodice was very sharp and poked me all night until I finally stuck bandaids over the areas that were rubbing. Skin was rubbed raw in places. Fabric is much more synthetic then it looks in photos...almost like a swim suit. All that to say, it was still a beautiful dress but wouldn't recommend due to it being quite uncomfortable.","July 16, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL51","Kirstie","Cute but elegant; bring the polka dots back!","I wore this to dinner and the premier of Hamilton at the Kennedy center in DC. Received many compliments and it's a good style for someone with a waist or hint of a waist. Only negative is that there is ribbing in the dress and it cuts into your sides a bit. I sized up one just because I wasn't sure if the dress would be a large fit or small. I easily could have worn a smaller size. It's a flexible fabric. But am happy that I chose the size that I did because of the ribbing. Would certainly rent again.","July 2, 2018","Other"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL51","Anita","Hard to decide on this one","This is a dress I have a love/hate relationship with because of a few things: the sizing, fabric and cut. From the photos, it's adorable. So retro. But in person I'm not sure it comes across so well. Sizing: the ten was too small but the 12 was too big, especially in the skirt area. It added extra ""pounds"" to an already full dress. The 10 was just too tight in the waist. Fabric: be warned -- the fabric is like a scuba suit. It's that's type, which I didn't realize when I ordered it. From a far, it looks great. Up close, the print is blurry and doesn't feel appropriate for the high-end event I attended. Cut: this tended to flatten the girls and needed a few more inches in the torso length. I also think it cut the arms and made them look larger. Overall, a fine rental for a party, but not a gala.","June 24, 2018","Formal Affair"

It's not a huge issue bc the dress itself is spectacular and the color blocking is so fun!! I had to wear my highest heels (I'm 5'4"") to keep it from dragging on the floor, so the 2P would have been great if available. I also ordered the 0R which I almost wore, but it was tight in my rib cage.","January 26, 2020","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/JS161","Kathryn","Showstopper!","Not sure how to review the fit; I feel like the dresses I received may have been mislabeled. The 4R was longer and larger than the 6R. I ended up wearing the 6R. I'm 5'2"" and with 4"" heels the dress length was perfect in the 6R, while in the size 4R I had 3"" of extra material trailing. Because of where the cut out was on the torso, I had to wear adhesive cups and could not wear a strapless bra as I had planned because the bottom of it was showing. Not a problem for me, as I have pretty small boobs, but larger-busted ladies may want to steer clear. Otherwise, the dress was absolutely gorgeous. It was comfortable to wear to a Florida wedding, light and breezy. The color combination was just stunning and I felt really beautiful. Lots of compliments all night.","January 2, 2020","Large"

It could have been the design of the dress but I was very discouraged trying on the 14 & I had to get 2 people to zip me in lol But luckily it was only uncomfortable zipping and never throughout the night except slightly under my chest where the dress goes out.

The 2 tones of red (classic red/orangey-red) added interest to the design and structurally I loved the unique neckline as well as the small cutout on the breast/ chest area. I arrived at the wedding and was horrified that the length was so long (my fault for thinking I could get away with a L length). I'm 5'5"". But I was able to tuck the extra fabric underneath the band between the bodice and skirt and it did just the trick! NO bulk, no discomfort.

I think this dress would fit almost any body type. I usually wear a 10-12 and the 12 fit really well for the stomach area. I wore this with spanx to smooth out some tummy lines, because while this dress isn't tight, it is slightly fitted to the waist. They were out of the 12Regular so I got the 12Long, which was WAY too long - I'm 5'8 and even with 4 inch heels this dress was dragging. It wasn't a deal breaker but I wouldn't get the long again. In person you I got a lot of compliments on the dress. In the pictures the colors look the same but in person you can tell its two different colors.","July 30, 2019","True to Size"

As a reporter, I need to look glamorous for these events but also comfortable when I stand in the blazing sun for hours then sit through an awards show afterwards. This did not let me down. The contrast of red and orange fabric is really unique, and the flair works perfectly - especially when combined with a slight breeze. The zipper on mine was really still, but I think it was a new item. Be careful with the cutouts too, I kept checking it all day to make sure everything was kept in place but happily didn't suffer any fashion trauma.","July 19, 2019","Formal Affair"

If you are petite this dress may not work for you due to the length,the zipper was a little difficult to pull up especially in the area where it gathers ( you definitely need someone to help zip you) The dress had a high slit which made it sexy , the style was perfect for hiding bumps and bulges. I wore sticky cups because a regular strapless bra was visible once the dress was on I did not have to do any adjusting. The color was amazing and I received many compliments .

The neckline on this dress is so different and elegant! The straps can untwist/unfold to cover more of your shoulders if you'd like, or you can twist them up to be thinner. I wore them right on the edge of my shoulder. The little keyhole didn't pose a risk of exposing anything and was a fun little detail! I would say it runs a bit small. The waistband has zero ""give"" to it (and can be tricky to zip due to the folds/pleats) so if you have a wide ribcage like myself, sizing up for your backup size may make for a more comfortable fit.","June 18, 2019","Small"

The 2R, which is what usually fits me 80% of the time on RTR was too small. I have wider hips and it took some work to get the bottom half on, but after I did the top was too short for my torso. I couldn't get the straps over my head even though the straps are adjustable. Might try again with the 4R.","April 9, 2019","Small"

It was a very bizarre fit and I'm glad RTR sent me another jumper to try because that's what I ended up wearing (see other reviews for photo). The material is very, very thin as well.

If you sweep your shirt to the left, you get snakeskin, to the right, you get gold bling. As a result, as the night goes on, gold sequins peak out of the shirt. Its the perfect amount of sparkles. Shirt is a slight crop that works well with mid rise pants. The fit is meant to be on the larger end so the XS fit well.","February 15, 2020","Large"

It is also reversible sequins- if you run your hands along the shirt it will change from snakeskin to gold sequins. The top will still show some gold even if you put it on the snakeskin side because over the shoulder purses, coats, and getting up and down from chairs will cause parts of it to flip to gold. Even though it wasn't what I expected I really liked the shirt. It is not as boxy as I thought it might be and it's really fun and has a cute back!","January 7, 2019","Date"

It definitely fits a little boxy, but I think that's part of the design. The sequins are super high quality. It can be worn on the snakeskin side or if you swipe them over, the sequins are all gold on the opposite side! 2 tops in one! I usually wear a 2 or 4 in tops, ordered the small and XS and ended up wearing the XS because I liked the fit better. It ran a little shorter than I expected, but that was fine. It is fully lined so the sequins aren't itchy, however I did find the tags to be very itchy (would have cut them out if I owned it!) The lining also occasionally shows at the hem. Wore it with black jeans and over the knee boots for a low-key but still festive New Years Eve dinner.","January 4, 2019","True to Size"

The dress does have some stretch and is very forgiving, so I'd recommend sizing down at least one size, two sizes if you're smaller chested. The dress was longer on me than on the model, but that's pretty standard because I'm shorter. Still looked great with low heels. I would 10/10 recommend this dress.

I rented it for my daughters' dance recital...a day that is usually hot and I do a lot of running around. This dress suited the occasion perfectly. I was super comfortable and almost everyone I passed complimented the dress. The style of the dress (cap sleeves, flare at bottom, keyhole back) coupled with the lace/brightly colored embroidery are very eye-catching and unexpected. As far as fit - I would have preferred to wear the medium as it fit me better in the bodice however it was WAY too short. It would have been okay if my day consisted of only sitting or standing still, but with all the moving and up/down I'd be doing it wasn't going to work. So I went with the large to give me more coverage over the butt. It was a little roomy but not to the point where it looked frumpy at all. Highly recommend this one!","June 11, 2019","True to Size"

Very forgiving for postpartum.","Very comfortable classic dress for black tie event. 6.5mo postpartum; the dress is very forgiving, paired with spanx. It hugged in all the right places and hid my problem areas. Was able to wear it with a strapless bra - the neckline is flattering but not too busty. Wore it with modern RTR earrings, and silver mesh RTR clutch. I'm 5'6"" - the 12L with 3"" heels just barely touched the ground.

Pros: color matches perfectly with the Air Force mess dress, hugs you in the right places, can wear Spanx underneath as long as it's seamless. Cons: the bottom hem came out of my dress so it was way longer, I did have to pull it up throughout the night but it may not be a big deal for you! Also the hanger straps kept poking out.

Very comfortable - I did find it to be a little low cut but nothing inappropriate. I wore a 2R with 3.5"" heels and it was still probably 1/2"" long on me. I'm 5'6. The hips and pleating in the skirt are very generous - full and flattering so if you have a bigger rear end or wider hips then this dress will still work great for you.

It's true to size - it was a close call between the 6 and the 8, but the 8 gave me a little more room to breathe during a long evening. No Spanx required, but still form fitting and slimming!

It's boob city but it's long and loose at the bottom (but still very feminine feeling not baggy or bulky) so it evens out nicely and feels trendy and edgy not skanky. The ties aren't adjustable but the straps are. I have a somewhat wide chest/rib cage but not huge boobs and they were pretty exposed. The 6 didn't feel too tight it zipped easily but was fitted enough with a bit of stretch on the backside too. Pretty comfortable.","February 13, 2020","True to Size"

I ended up going a size bigger than I typically would because or was the only size available. So I think the dress was just slightly too big but overall was beautiful. But beware! This dress shows a lot of boob! I personally didn't mind it, but if you are busty or conservative, this may not be the dress for you. But otherwise the print, the boob-age, and the cut and style was edgy and sexy and cool!","December 21, 2019","Wedding"

The top fit my smaller frame perfectly and the flowiness of the dress was very flattering. It is a bit long for my height, I'm 5'3 so it went down to just above my ankles, not exactly how I expected it to look but I think it still looked great. The material of the dress is cotton but it had a sheen that almost looks like silk so it's very comfortable to wear but it looks more extravagant.

I have a hard time with jumpsuits, having thicker legs, and felt this was nice and roomy on my thighs while still being flattering up top. The tie details at the waist do a good job of hiding the tummy, making for a super flattering fit. Overall it was fairly comfortable but the other reviewers are 1,000% correct that this jumper has an oddly short torso. As someone who is 5'6 with a fairly long torso, this made wearing the jumpsuit a little uncomfortable but bearable. It felt like the jumper was constantly riding up but didn't look like it was riding up. Beware that it does also have a full zipper in the back and you will most likely need to enlist some help to get zipped/unzipped.

I wore this on a rainy fall day and snapped this picture once I got back home. I received so many compliments on my entire outfit. The best part about this jumper is the fact that without a jacket it's still work appropriate. One down fall is the torso is a bit short so zipping yourself in/out gets a bit intimate when you try to reach your arms around and it seems like your shoulders might bust a seam.

I often rent a size small when those are the options, but noticed a medium was a size 6, so I went with that. It was so tight all over and magnified every area in the worst way. It also just grazed my knees which made the all around unflattering look even worse. If it had been tea length, I feel like it somehow could have balanced out. I just looked enormous and stumpy.","December 18, 2018","Party"

I wore the 0R in this dress and it was slightly large in the waist and the bust. I used fabric tape to keep the neckline down and to keep the waist from gapping. I expected the neckline to be very low (and it was!), but it also felt like maybe there wasn't quite enough fabric width-wise on the front of the dress, so be prepared for some potential side-boob as well. It's a beautiful dress - fun to twirl in (taped up, of course), and reached the ground in three-inch heels.","January 10, 2020","Large"

I would recommend sizing down because it's not really that tight anywhere and I added a small sash that helped make the waist smaller and define my waist nicely. I wore 4"" heels and you could just barely see my shoes, and when I took them off to dance the dress barely brushed the floor. Super easy to dance in and it's not very tight so I didn't have to worry about bloating after dinner/drinks. I had no issues with my breasts falling out and didn't wear a bra/need sticky tape.

I'm fairly petite (5'4, 100) and it was not overwhelming at all. The style is not fitted, but in my opinion still really flattering and surprisingly comfortable. While the dress is low cut, the heavier weight of the fabric kept the top in place and I had no issues with that aspect (despite many hours of sitting down, dancing, walking around, etc.) My only concern was the length. I got the size 0R and the dress was still a little bit too long, despite wearing heels.","January 14, 2019","True to Size"

My only negative is the top of my bra would sometimes show on the side that was sleeveless.","October 2, 2019","Wedding"

I thought the print and style of dress was good for that occasion however I did not really love it overall. The sleeves are a lot puffier than they appear in the photo so just be mindful of that. I felt it ran big I ordered a L and XL as my backup because I am tall so I did not want it to be too sure, but I probably could have got a M. I wore it with knee high boots as it was a bit chilly out but it would look great with heels or flats too. I thought it was just an OK dress, not my favorite RTR.","August 20, 2019","Large"

A bra is impossible to wear with it, but fashion tape and petals did the trick for me. I showed a lot more chest than i'm used to, but you're so covered everywhere else the whole look is balanced. It's elegant, feminine and fun. Will likely rent again!","January 3, 2020","Wedding"

Checked all the boxes: fantastic fit, beautiful, glamorous, covered up & still sexy (appropriately so!). It has a different & potentially challenging length that was what drew me to the dress initially...not too long or too short (I'm 5'9""). It's fitted through the bust to waist and then has a gently full-ish bottom. Good for walking, dancing, sitting, getting in/out of cars, using the loo. Lining stays in place. Never ever would I have bought a green sequined dress. It would have been black and boring. This dress would have been unthinkable before RTR. Now I could actually live the fashion fantasy and indulge in something stunning & decadent. This is a dress I felt fantastic in, and part of it was definitely that I didn't have to spend a fortune to buy and then another fortune to dry-clean and let sit in my closet for...ever. It was liberating.","October 31, 2018","True to Size"

I have quite a small waist so I thought it would hit on the smallest part of my waist and be very flattering. Unfortunately, it hit just below my waist which is a very awkward spot for a dress to hit in general. I think it was doing this because the shoulder staps were a little too long on me. My shoulders are not very broad but I am quite tall so I'd take this into account before you rent this dress! The long straps caused the whole dress to slump down on my body.

Length seemed like it would be good for a variety of people, I am 5'5"" and wore 3"" heels and dress barely grazed the floor. The back of this dress zips up the skirt to waist, and then has 2 eye hooks on the back: one in the middle and one at the neckline. THE BACK IS OPEN aside from these closures, I ended up wearing a lacy halter bralette as a regular bra would have shown in the back. There is NO stretch in this dress, keep in mind for fitting your hips. I am a true apple shape so the waistline was tightest for me - I ended up wearing the size 12, I didn't even try the 10 on even though I usually wear a size 10 (but I've been a bit sloppy with my diet sooo it could be true sizing right now lol). My tummy pooch is the one area I want to hide and this dress did do a surprisingly good job of that despite the tight fit in the lower abdomen and hips. Also note: you WILL need to steam or iron this dress if it arrives slightly wrinkled. I used a low-heat iron on the back of the fabric and it worked great, it didn't seem to be an issue the rest of the night. There is also a slit up the left leg (which I personally like). Overall, it's a beautiful and VERY comfortable dress, if you keep all notes in mind. I appeared to be the first to wear this dress as there were no prior reviews and both dresses arrived with tags. Took a chance, glad it worked out, but would probably not be my very first choice if I hadn't needed to rent 3 days before my event. But I'd wear this pop of color over a safe black dress if that's your thing!","September 9, 2019","Formal Affair"

While the dress fit in the 12 and wasn't tight, the material is thin, so it outlined my stomach area/belly button which I'm super picky about and avoid on all dresses. The 14 was huge at the top, but i draped it primarily in the back and held it with fashion tape. It looked beautiful, drapey, Grecian, and the color - just wow. I would absolutely rent this again.","November 13, 2019","Small"

Great dress for larger busts, but may want to opt for a mid-rise control top thong to keep it smooth on the bottom half. The sheen would accent any bulges and the material is thin. I ordered an 8L and it fit like a glove. Def needed longer length for heels. Also, this dress has a peekaboo back which I didn’t expect, but liked a lot.

I found the bust and waist to be a tad lose on me (32B/C), so unfortunately I was tugging at it, especially while dancing.","August 5, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH265","Cassie","Super fun to wear","This was a super fun piece to wear. It was super flattering and really flows nicely and was a blast to dance in. I felt like a can-can girl all night! The pockets are deep enough I did not even need a clutch, and you could not see a bulge in the skirt with all my stuff. My only complaint is the sizing. The bodice has an inner lining with boning so it really is smaller than the actual size. The size I generally always wear was way too snug and the zipper felt really tight. However the backup size was drastically bigger. I was able to make it work with a super push up bra, but I did find it slipping throughout the night and I had to keep picking it back up. Otherwise it was super comfortable and I really loved it. I hated to return it. I hope someone else has as much fun as I did wearing it at their next event!!","August 3, 2019","Wedding"

Dresses tend to fit me snug around the rib cage and this was certainly true in this case. I had to wear the 10 and it was still a very snug fit in that area. I'm usually a 6 or 8 in dresses elsewhere. The dress also had some torn fabric along the seam above one of the pockets. I was determined to wear the dress though so I made it work.","July 24, 2019","Formal Affair"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SH265","Ginger","This gorgeous dress landed me tons of compliments!","I really wanted to love this dress, because it is gorgeous in person as it is online. I did receive numerous compliments on this beautiful dress! The event took place mid-Summer in the South (HOT) and this dress is made of a heavier material which wasn't ideal for a mid-summer event. I also prefer light weighted items. My hips are wider than the model's and I felt like this dress accentuated my hips making them appear wider than they are. I would say I am a size 4+ because I'm too small for size 6 but need size 4s to have a little forgiveness. This dress fit my body perfectly like a glove. If your body shape can handle this style go for it. As I said I wanted to LOVE this dress but it just wasn't the best style for my body shape.","July 3, 2019","True to Size"

I received many compliments on the look. Very flattering and a good length for a shorter person who does not want to risk a too-long hem or having to wear 5"" heels to make the dress work. I never go bra-free, but this bodice is actually very structured and supportive, so I went without for a smoother line. No issues with slippage!","July 1, 2019","True to Size"

I thought it looked super cool, but, sadly, it looked a bit meh on me, and I did not receive many compliments on this one. It might have just been too long which added to the voluminous effect to the skirt. Though it was not the most flattering item, I did wear it a couple of times paired with a fitted black long-sleeve top, black tights, and black heels.

The material is shiny and a bit stiff, but the asymmetrical poof gives this piece great character. I wore it with a simple black top and high boots into the office, but it's a piece that can be dressed up, down, or even serve as a base for a Halloween costume.

Yes, the sleeves are tight and the fabric has zero give, but damn, this dress was seriously sexy. I wanted to play up the more casual vibe so styled it with black sandals for a low key night out.

(You can find at your local bridal shop for about $20) The arms were a bit tight, but not uncomfortable at all. The back is plain, so a bright pink pashmina will spice up the look from the back. I thought it had a Spanish feel, but my makeup artist thought it looked like a Russian doll dress. Either way, gorgeous. Very comfortable and tons of compliments. This dress was a last resort option as it was only available in a size 12. I normally wear an 8-10 in clothes, and I had ordered 5 dresses. This is the ONLY one that zipped. My best advice when renting on this site would be to size up a couple of sizes for sure, just so you have a better chance of getting the dress you want that will actually fit.

I wore it to a family dinner and to church. Super overdressed for both but the dress is so beautiful I didn't care. It does feel a bit like a costume with the dramatic embroidery. Very well made, very flattering. I wore with a black tank beneath and it looked like part of the dress.

I ordered it in a 2R and if you are under 5'3 (as I am) I would recommend ordering the 0 instead. In the front it was about 2 inches too long and I had to hold up the dress when I walked. There are many ties and actually figuring out how to put on the dress was a challenge but once I figured it out I really loved how it fit and the material.

My only criticism which is nothing compared to how good I felt in it or a major concern but it is slightly sheer so needed seamless underwear and there is a higher than I am comfortable with slit in the back. Also I used a sticky bra that gave me a slight lift since I didn't want to go completely braless but with this dress you can be braless for sure and still looks good with larger breast.","September 3, 2019","Wedding"

The slightly raised drawstring waist is genius as it can be adjusted to your figure. The only complaint I have about this dress is that the accordion pleats, which would have taken it to the next level, had been completely ironed out - probably in the dry cleaning process.

My daughters both told me to take off the bra and wear some body tape to keep it in place, but that was NOT going to happen. I'm beginning to think that the RTR styles are not for older fuller women.

My mind quickly changed, once I put the dress on. Even without a bra & a waist trainer, I felt beautiful. The fabric is A+, it moves with you, which is a bonus. The only complaint I have, as with other dresses with RTR, is that after a couple of hours, your body heat brings out the ghosts of the women that have worn the dress previously. By that I mean, no matter how much deodorant I put on, I felt a bit musty after a couple of hours, which NEVER happens in my regular clothes. It can make you feel very self conscious. I don't know if RTR can do anything to prevent this, but, I have to let it be known. Other than that, I felt like a queen! Lots of looks and compliments.","February 28, 2020","True to Size"

I was able to wear a regular bra, straps didn't show.

There was a slight stretch in the off the shoulder part of the shirt but it was tight which is great to avoid it sliding but not so great if you have broader shoulders. It did flare up with the wind but otherwise great day top!","May 22, 2017","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/AX67","RTR Customer","Great quality, runs TTS, just isn't my style.","I am normally a size Small in Alexis, and tried this in as XS so it wouldn't swallow my petite frame, but th small would've fit more comfortably and perhaps showed more of my collarbone/chest area. The shirt sleeves stay put and do not ride up on the shoulders. The material is substantial, and the style is cute. However, I don't like to cover my arms normally, as it makes me feel bulky, and restricted. I rented this to step out of my comfort zone and I just didn't like the style on me. But, if you like the look and don't mind sleeves, don't hesitate.","May 2, 2017","True to Size"

Running very small with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted at the hips. It works for cup sizes A-C. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress so you should wear nubra, strapless, or no bra since the denim is pretty, ""supportive"" at the bust. At 5’4”, the length hit tea length on me. The pattern on the dress is amazing in person and makes it a very unique way to wear denim. Pair with black, nude, or even blue heels and fun earrings to complete your outfit!","January 25, 2019","Small"

I didn't realize the dress was denim when I ordered it but thought it would be great. Normally I'm a size 4 but I needed to wear the 6. Mainly because my chest was way, way too big for the 4 although it fit much better everywhere else. There's absolutely no give because it's denim so there was no way around it, I had to wear the 6. The 6 was almost a little too big up top and was definitely too big on the bottom. It worked but it could have fit better. I'd recommend this dress to ladies who have similar chest and hip measurements.","August 21, 2018","Party"

I'm 5ft 2 inches, 160 lbs, and wear a size 34 DD.

I received countless compliments all evening from people who went out of their way to tell me how nice the dress looked. The fabric has a slight shimmer in some places which catches the light subtley. I would definitely say it runs slightly small though, so order a size up for the backup size. The fabric does not have any stretch or give to it. My main complaint is with the silk straps used to hang the dress after you wear it. They wouldn't stay tucked in and kept popping out all night (as seen in second photo).

I wore it out to dinner on vacation in Bali, and I loved it so much, I wore it out again a different night. The cut is so different and eye-catching, so I got a lot of compliments since it's just a unique dress. It think it runs a TINY bit large... but it's minimal, so don't be scared to give yourself a little wiggle room. Since it's strapless and the un-strapped bust part needs to stay secure, I wouldn't start sizing up too much. I'm usually a 10, went with a 12 because of reviews, but as the night wore on, I could tell that a 10 would have been a little more secure. It's a gorgeous dress, and the cut-out peek fits in a flattering place, so it doesn't highlight any trouble areas. One of my favorite rentals to date!","October 21, 2019","Large"

I wore Spanx's open bust catsuit w/a strapless bra underneath for extra smoothness & just slid the catsuit straps off my shoulders. For some reason, the 44L was much longer than the 46, so I went with the 46 & it was perfect w/3.5"" pumps. If you have thick arms like me, the sleeves are also stretchy!","December 11, 2019","Party"

I wore small wedges (maybe 1.5"") and wouldn't have been able to wear any taller heels without it being too short. I have a fairly long torso, so I made sure to pull it down a bit throughout the night (and especially for photos!), but it for comfortably. I got endless compliments all night!

Wore the 8 (44L) because I couldn't get the 6 (42L) over my booty. This jumpsuit has NO ZIPPERS, it is a pull on style as are all the pieces from this designer, so if you've got an a**, I suggest sizing up. The jumpsuit fit like a dream once on and I wish I had a full body pic to share. Did not wear a bra or shape wear as the material keeps you up and in and is extremely forgiving.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF21","Madeleine","Dream dress!","I LOVE this dress! I was a bit nervous renting it because it didn't have any reviews, but the sizing is consistent with other Reformation dresses. This dress is lined and has a great weight to it, which means it drapes beautifully. The skirt is bias cut, but I didn't find that it bulged out in weird spots like some other bias cut materials do. The fabric has no stretch to it, but isn't too tight when you move your arms thanks to a keyhole at the back that gives it some flexibility. Rented this for a garden party and was so so pleased! I'd buy it if I had more opportunity to wear it.","May 31, 2019","True to Size"

I love it. Very versatile. I am tallish though so it can easily be jacked up slightly to look like a great, hot top over skinny 3/4 jeans. If you are shorter, it might look like a dress over jeans. I am sure you can be creative though to shorten the middle. Love this..

My one issue is that the top of the dress was very stretched out from a previous renter. I thought maybe it was the cut of the dress, but the fabric by the bust l had obviously been stretched out and was loose. However, nothing that creative safety pinning couldn't fix!","December 18, 2019","Formal Affair"

I would say that it runs slightly large as I'm normally a size 2 but I wore the 0. I'm short but with tall heels the dress was the perfect length.

Like the other reviews state, the straps are a bit too long (but forces you to maintain better posture) and the slit up the side of the dress will expose your underwear if you don't safety pin it.

However I received a lot of compliments and would rent it again!","October 22, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BH70","RTR Customer","Comfortable and flattering!","This dress fit very well, the top/ bust area was a tiny bit loose, but tying a ribbon around back straps fixed that. The slit is pretty high so if you wear spanx with leg, you might have to fold up the left side so it doesn't show. When sitting down, the slit was really high and I needed to cover my lap with a napkin. Overall the dress was comfortable, looked great, and I received many compliments.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN18","RTR Customer","TIPS to wear this STUNNING + DIFFICULT dress!","Perfect dress for a destination wedding, had been looking at it for a while, and am so happy it worked out in the end! I knew it would run small (rented a 10 when I'm usually 4), I knew it would be extra long (I'm 5'7, definitely Regular length would have been ideal but they didn't have it in my size), and I knew fashion tape would be a must (I took a loooooot, not just for chest area but also in case I needed to improvise a hem), little to say, I took lots of preventative measures. . However, once put together and at the wedding, difficulties wearing this dress quickly pileeeeed up, and had to excuse myself and Macgyver the dress like there was no tomorrow. . LENGTH- best advice is rent correct length ASAP!! I'm 5'7, wore 4"" heels and my impromptu fashion tape hem still had to gather about 3"" of that length! In spite of that, hem lasted only about half hour and a dance. . CHEST- Everyone said ""fashion tape!!!"", honestly, that definitely wasn't enough. I have a long torso and B cup, thought that + tape would work just fine. Know that you'll need INSANE posture. HIGHLY recommend for you to look at what adjustments need to be done while Sitting down, not just while you're standing gracefully. I had to roll the back of the neck two times and safety pin (at the back of the neck) to make it more snug, TIP roll from the outside in, instead of inside out, neckline looks nicer. Although not necessary for the look, I did wear spax, it helped a tooooon with the previously mentioned insane posture.","June 6, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN18","Stephanie","MAJOR SHOWSTOPPER with a belt, total flop without one.","This dress was so unique and beautiful. It is definitely heavier than it looks bc of all the pleated fabric. I'm 5'8"", athletic and normally a size 6 (8 on a bad day in the winter) and the 12R fit me best.

I was able to make it work but I really needed the 8R. So, size up if you can. Also, the Regular is very long. I wore 4inch heels and still had to pick the dress up to walk/dance. I loved the length for pictures though. Lastly, and obviously, the dress shows a lot of cleavage and side boob. You will absolutely need some tape.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN18","Dianna","Unique + interesting piece, stand out from the crowd!","As a quirky girl with a love of the bold and colorful, this was love at first sight for me. Didn't end up wearing as it didn't feel right for the event and season, but may consider it for summer. This dress is so particular in its pattern and just right in its drape, the fabric is textural and bends around curves in such an interesting way. But it is LONG. At 5,9"" and in 3"" heels, it still puddles on the floor. I love to dance, and I wasn't sure I'd feel super free to move as I will with the length and the cut (the lining is cut slimmer than the skirt). On my frame, I feel like the halter could have been tighter/pulled up a bit. Tried rolling the neck (think a Grecian twist) which simulated a better fit. Would have LOVED to try it with the belt to synch in the extra fabric at the waist (the fold of the seam creates additional width right where you want it to nip), and I think it would have added a touch more formality. Still a love from me!","December 10, 2018","Party"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SLN18","Lisa","I blended right in with the Africa theme!","The dress was beautiful but the plunging neckline was tough for me. I have very large (34DD+) breasts and it is impossible to find a bra that could be worn with this dress for me. I tried fashion tape but it is not tight fitting enough for that to be a solution. I ended up pinning the bottom of the two halter pieces together for about 4 inches up the front of the dress to make it more like a deep V then used fashion tape to hold things in place! I'd honestly rent this dress again but would fix it up well in advance versus in the Uber ride to the event!","November 12, 2018","True to Size"

Running small with little stretch, I recommend going one size up for your primary size. This style is somewhat fitted throughout midsection and fitted throughout the hips. It works well for any cup size. You are not able to wear a bra with this style, however I would recommend using either modesty covers. At 5'8 the gown hit floor length on me. I would pair this style with a leather open-toe sandal and simple clutch to complete your look! I added my own waist belt to this look because I wanted a more gathered look at the seam of the halter so that I had more coverage. Having a smaller cup size that really came in handy !

Also the lining of the dress was ripped from the main fabric so I also pinned that. RTR gave me a discount for the poor quality. Even with these issues, the dress was so stunning, it deserved a four stars. PS, you need impeccable posture to make sure the top stays where you want it.

The waistline is the most ""fitted"" part of the dress. My waist is 25in and I had to wear the US size 6. I couldn't get the belt to stay in the same place. It kept falling off but I kept it on because I felt that it gave nice touch to accentuate the waistline. The dress is very long even the regular size.

CONS: as other reviews state, the satin slip underneath is not flexible at all. The pencil skirt style means you are restricted when walking and dancing. I would recommend RTR have a tailor add slits on the sides. It can be done without compromising the dress or affecting the existing back slit. OTHER: not a pro or a con, but the dress is definitely not for the faint of heart in terms of exposure. Your back is fully exposed and the front is tough if you are a C or more. Fashion tape or a safety pin will be your best friend!","January 29, 2018","Small"

I opted to dress it down with a simple tee shirt and booties since the sparkly panel is a lot. I agree that the waist has no give, but runs a little large so the XS was good for sitting at my natural waist. The panels do add bulk to your hips so I had to spin the skirt so that the side zip was in the back, that way the panels didn't line up with my hips so it was more flattering.","February 17, 2019","Other"

It could easily be fashion taped to make it secure, and FWIW, I never ended up exposed. I wore this with ~3in heels and it was about half an inch to an inch off the ground.

The back is stretchy so it's forgiving. The only negative thing about the dress was that the clasps at the back of the neck kept coming undone and the neck piece was a little loose for my neck so I ended up securing it with a couple pins and making it a little tighter around the neck. If I wore my hair all the way up that would've been a problem. Also I filled out the top of the dress just fine, but for women with small bust this dress will be a bit baggy at the top and you'll probably have to get some chicken cutlets; not sure that a strapless bra would work with this dress.

Because the dress has the neck collar, it was hard to even try to fake it or pull it up a certain way to make it work. There's just too much fabric between where the dress hits the waist and the top of the neck so unless you have a bigger chest, I would not recommend.

I will say that I thought it would wrinkle but it held up most of the day - the photo is from the end of the day and there are only a few wrinkles.

I got the XL since I'm busty, but may have been able to get away with a large and perhaps the neckline wouldn't have plunged so much. Had this been an adult evening event, a push up bra might have been the trick.

Was tighter than a regular 6 because I realized that it was Australian sizing but the 6 fit pretty well.

The fabric is nice and thick, with plenty of stretch. I went on the conservative side and ordered a size up (US 12), but I totally could have stayed with my usual size (US 10). The cut is incredibly flattering; I loved the neckline, hug on the hips and the slit. Like other reviews have mentioned, the straps are really, really long. I did a quick temporary stitch to shorten them a little and it worked well. Pair it with a leather jacket and get ready for the compliments to roll in!","September 22, 2019","True to Size"

I wore a 10R (fits like a U.S. Size 6) because I only received one size. It was a little big especially in the straps but since it had a good amount of stretch it wasn't too noticeable, would have gotten the 8R if it had been available as I was adjusting a bit all night due to the large straps. I received a lot of compliments though and really loved the vibrant color! First time red dress renter! Note- I think if I had the smaller size this wouldn't have been an issue but I planned to wear my stick on bra but it kept showing on the sides when the dress slide down cause the straps weren't very tight.","August 19, 2019","Wedding"

But, I went with the size 10 because I could use the extra fabric to wrap around and cover more of my cleavage and i was able to wear a bra.

It has a lot of volume in the sleeves and skirt, which could be overwhelming on a shorter and smaller frame, but felt great for my 5'10 height. On sizing, I probably could have gone with a six, given that there is plenty of room for bigger hips. I fluctuate between a 6, if the primary measurement is on my waist (29"") and a 8 or 10 if more form fitting in the hips (mine are 42"") It's a special standout dress I would rent again.","June 5, 2019","Work"

This is not because it runs large, necessarily, but because there was plenty of room in the bust and hips so I would go for the size you desire for your waist. However, this dress is not just good for hourglass figures, it drapes so beautifully in the bust and hips that it would also work for pears, and the waist is constructed so that if you are more of an oval shape, it would create a waist. The only thing is that I wouldn't suggest it for petites.","June 21, 2019","True to Size"

The pleated neckline/sleeves and oversized balloon sleeves made my shoulders look extra wide and my emphasized my chest in an unattractive way.

Things to consider: The least forgiving part of the dress is around the rip cage. The belly area was going to allow for food and bev to be consumed with no issues and it is starting to flare out at the hips but helping to keep up the strapless bodice is the fitted bodice. The size 2 I needed help getting into and honestly had to let some air out of my lungs to get it zipped but once I was in I was comfortable the entire night and didn't have to pull up on the dress to keep it from moving down ( the typical pain of wearing strapless). I will note I did wear taller heals ( maybe 3"" ) and that was just perfect. If I had gone shorter in heal height I think I would have been stepping on the dress if I stepped back. B/c of the high/low cut this was not a problem when walking ( forward). Something to consider for people dancing though if you don't plan on wearing a higher heal.","February 17, 2020","True to Size"

I have to agree with them; I thought about wearing pasties with it because I was potentially in danger of flashing someone if I made a wrong move, but ultimately decided against that and had no problems. I normally wear a size 0, but the 0R wasn't available the weekend of the wedding I was attending so I chose the 2R and 2L instead. I ended up wearing the 2R because with my ~2.5"" heels the dress reached the ground perfectly and didn't have any issues with it dragging or people stepping on the back. The straps were a bit itchy and kept sliding off my shoulders from time to time, but these weren't really major issues. The zipper was a little hard to get up, as other people mentioned. The material was also pretty thick but not so thick that I was sweating (I live in Texas and it's still roughly 90+ degrees here in late September so this was also a concern); I feel that this dress is really good for all times of the year. I absolutely loved how deep the pockets were. I didn't even have to bring any sort of purse with me.

The dress has pockets which is an amazing addition and I didn't have the same problems others did with the straps despite having a smaller bust so I was concerned the straps might not stay put.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL233","RTR Customer","Elegant yet unique!","As others have stated, the zipper was a bit of an issue and ended up being a two person job. We did put some WD-40 on it to be safe because my second helper couldn't arrive until 30 minutes before we needed to leave. Not sure if that helped or not, but once she was able to hold it closed, the zipper went right up. (One person tried for 10 minutes before giving up due to frustration). Overall, fit great and I got a lot of compliments. Straps are a bit itchy and since they aren't adjustable, I had to use double sided tape so I didn't have any wardrobe malfunctions. I don't like to wear super long heels either and length was great to wear with my standard medium to low block heel.","June 3, 2019","True to Size"

I don't usually have the girls on display like I did with this dress (Very Low-Cut) but they were still well protected. Loved the material, felt like a princess! The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is those dang straps! So so sooooo long. I had to tie and tape them at the top, which was a last resort since this was my back up dress size (the 8R didn't zip up because of the ladies). But it still worked out. I still recommend just be ready to possibly tape straps or whatever better solution you can find!","May 24, 2019","True to Size"

The 4L was way too long so I wore the 4R which was a smidge too short. It was very flattering and otherwise fit perfectly and true to size. I loved the pink underside of the fabric, it was a nice surprise. Be aware the the neckline is VERY low so if you're not comfortable with that, you will not like this dress. Also the straps were quite uncomfortable as they're thin strings. Other than that, I loved this dress and received many compliments. Pockets!","May 1, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL233","Audrey","It has pockets!!!","I absolutely loved this dress! I wore it for my senior prom and received many compliments on the style and design of the flowers! I did have some concerns about the top as it fit me loose in the bust area and the straps were a bit itchy digging into my shoulders. A little double sided tape along the neckline did the trick! Additionally, the zipper and I had some issues: I had previously ordered this same dress and size and the zipper would not go up due to the amount of fabric coming together in the middle. I returned that one and ordered the same dress and size once again, this time with a better zipper. I would recommend having a backup dress just in case it does not zip and have patience through the process! The pockets were wonderful to hold my phone, id, and anything else needed! I would highly recommend!!","April 28, 2019","Formal Affair"

Oh and the pockets are super fun.","April 26, 2019","Formal Affair"

I could actually eat and dance without feeling the dress would burst. I didn't even need a clutch/bag due to the pockets. I'm 5""7 and wore 4inch heels so the shoes were exposed. Later on I swapped out for flats and the length was perfect. So if you are taller, consider an L (vs. an R). I have smaller chest so the deep V was very flattering (I'm usually a 4).

The deep V on the model is lower in person. Gives elegant cleavage for less endowed ladies. The fabric is thicker, so you can get away without wearing a bra. I'm in-between a 6 and an 8 in dresses (wider hips), so I went with an 8 to be safe but I think a 6 would have been fine. I threw this in my unlimited shipment on a whim, and I'm so glad I did! One of my new favorites!","October 13, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BEC12","Lacy","Sexy but sophisticated and not something anyone else will be wearing.","Wore this as a MOH and loved it. The slit is high but it's thin, so it's not really scandalous. The chest is low, but the smaller size you get, the more coverage you get. As others have said, this dress has a lot of stretch, so if you've got some curves or want to be able to move a lot, this will accommodate that without making you feel constricted. It's form-hugging but not uncomfortable. I was able to crouch down and adjust the bride's veil and dance all night without worry. Got the 6 and the 4 and went with the 4 -- the 6 was too broad in the shoulders and had some extra material at the lower back. It also seemed a bit more open at the chest. Get a good low-cut sticky bra!","July 8, 2019","Large"

I wouldn't recommend this for people with a larger chest because it was a little tight across the chest. I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 just because the dress I got looked a little worn out and the embroidery colors looked dull. No one else noticed it so it was fine.

I rented it for one dinner out while on vacation - I ended up wearing it multiple nights in a row because I loved it that much! I'm short so the length was longer on me, it still looked great with chunky heels. Very flowy and easy to walk around in. The top is a very deep V - I could see how it could be an issue for someone with a larger chest but I thought it was perfect and fun (with the right bra).

The sides go straight down with no shape and it hit my chest on a higher spot than what seems normal. I think it might be nice for larger chests and the top would sit correctly, but on my size B cup frame it did not work.

I wasn't sure about this dress when JR arrived bc it looked TINY... but the fabric is really stretchy and the dress looks great, feels comfortable, and is easy to move in. I wore a regular cross-back bra without issue. I would recommend spanks if you are concerned about your midsection, because even though the fabric is very thick, it's tight and sort of unforgiving.

S was a great fit around my slightly wider shoulders, but the rest of the dress was frumpy and bunched up in a very unflattering way. I went with XS, which was great around the torso and legs but pinched a bit around my back and shoulders. Despite this, the LOOK was great. The material is extremely stiff which feels slightly strange but is well structured and prevents wrinkling. I wore this for a friend's daytime birthday party and paired this with a very light cropped suede jacket with 3/4 length sleeves and got a TON of compliments. Would wear casually as well.

Pre-baby, I was 96 lbs. and generally wore 00/0/XS clothing. At my baby shower, I was 33 weeks pregnant 123 lbs. and still went with an XS judging by previous reviews. The fit was great - definitely very stretchy enough to fit my bump. I probably would've been better off getting a S to have a little bit more material & movement but XS fit just fine. It was sunny and high 70s/80s with a breeze that day and I was comfortable, but if it weren't for the breeze, I wouldn't recommend the sweater-like material for a warmer day. I'm 4'11 and the dress looked more like a maxi dress on me, rather than falling on or below my knees. If it weren't for my bump, it would've been a lot longer. I wouldn't have worn this dress if I wasn't pregnant, only because I'm too short to wear a dress like this.","June 28, 2019","True to Size"

The straps were definitely also too long on my small frame, giving them a baggy feel while the waist was perfect. Also as a short person, it was VERY low-cut on me. Thankfully, I don't have much to show in that department, but someone more busty than me could accidentally have a slip or two.","July 23, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL67","Morgan","Loved this too-small dress","The pattern on this dress is so beautiful and the way the fabric flows made me feel super elegant at an outdoor wedding. However!! I had to wear the dress partially unzipped in the back (much to the horror of my sweet, sweet boyfriend) because the size 2 was *so* tight in the ribcage area, and I didn't give myself enough time to have the next size up delivered before the wedding. If you have even the slightest bit wider ribcage, or if, like me, you enjoy a heavy meal along with many cocktails and at least 2 pieces of wedding cake, I would recommend sizing up. But with that being said, please let the fact that I wore this dress unzipped be a testament to how much I loved it. It's really beautiful and I got a ton of compliments.","July 16, 2019","Small"

Silky w/pockets","My hubby loved how i looked on this dress, i usually don't wear something low cut, and this one definitely was low cut for me but just a little adjusting w/some tape ;-) to keep in place. Good length, nicely fitting, even though there's no room around the rib-cage, so if you are wide there (i'm 34B) maybe size up. At the end of the night after a nice dinner, it felt a little constricted there. Beautiful fabric, and loved the pockets.","May 10, 2019","True to Size"

From the photo I imagined it would be a heavy embroidered piece. It's not modest, and I felt a bit ""over the top boobilicicious"" wearing it. Also, it was tight in the bodice and waist. I'm 32D and have a 28"" waist. I ordered a size 2, but I think size 4 would have been a more comfortable fit. My mistake for not sizing up. It's a great dress, tho!","May 1, 2019","Date"

It was a nice fit for an hourglass figure but it was just a little too low cut for me. If it were my own dress I would have had it lifted at the shoulders just a little. It felt a little too loose on the top. The dress has pockets but their placement can make you look extra hippy.","April 24, 2019","Party"

The dress was made from a silk printed panel fabric and the creative use of it is unbelievably pretty.

Fit: Waist is small. I'm an hourglass with a 27"" waist and am between a 4 and a 6 and the 6 fits me like a glove so you may need to size up. The straps are about an inch too long and they want to slip. I will have them altered so I can get a perfect fit.","May 1, 2020","True to Size"

Runs very true to size and since I went with a larger size on this dress, it did get a bit bunchy at times and hung loose on the hips. I suspect I could have gotten by with a smaller size and a tighter fit would have helped with the bunching. The bust was roomy so if you're between sizes like me, I'd recommend going smaller. Easy to wear with a strapless bra.","September 23, 2019","Formal Affair"

Only downside is I saw at least two other women wearing the same dress at the event, likely from RTR. Dress slips on our off, with no zipper. Material is very thick, so didn't show the shapewear I wore underneath. I sized up due to availability, which ended up fitting me perfectly as I am bigger on the hips side. It was a bit big in the bust as a result, but nothing that forced me to be uncomfortable or tugging on the dress. I definitely recommend!","June 19, 2019","Formal Affair"

The size 4 fit my hips and butt just fine, but if the top was fully zipped, it was too tight and fit awkward on my size 32DD chest.

It was the perfect balance of sweet, casual and comfortable. I usually wear a size 4, which fit me perfectly in this dress. I am VERY flat chested, and, while the chest of this dress was a bit big on me, it wasn't miles too large. I do think it might be tricky for someone with a fuller bust to be comfortable in--it would really squash the girls. Additionally, I consider myself to have quite a wide ribcage, which did make me a bit worried when choosing this dress. Sometimes when I wear dresses that are fitted in the ribcage area, they will be uncomfortably tight or restricting. This was not the case with this dress; I felt great and comfortable all night.

It is not made for curvy women unless your bust size is larger as well. The smaller size was too tight in the hips and not practical for dancing, going to the restroom alone, and sitting comfortably. The bust area fit well but was very low cut. The larger size fit in the hips, but was huge in the bust area.

The dress was the right length for me, but the straps were way too long, the hips were way too tight, and the bust is best suited for someone with a modest chest at best. The cups are very small. This dress would be best suited for someone who is tall with a long waist, and who has narrow hips.","February 13, 2020","Small"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/FNP74","Julia","Pretty, but not for petite pears!","This runs both small and large. I ordered the 2P (which is generally a size that works ideally for me). This was far too snug on the hips, and far too large in the bust. If you are apple shaped, I think this would be great for you! It's a pretty dress, and if you fill out the top I think it would look amazing, but it did not remotely work for my figure. If your measurements are like mine (32A, ~115 lbs, pear shaped), don't bother - this won't work for you! If you're busty, though, I think you might really enjoy this.","February 12, 2020","Small"

The dress makes you look very slender and is somewhat forgiving towards those less than perfect areas (i.e. in my case taille and arms) while still looking very feminine. I am in between a 4 and a 6 and while this dress appears to be true to size, I'll order a size up to compare which one looks better on me.

I was first struck by the material, which seemed a little worn. Overall, I think the style is great-- but one that is meant for a curvier petite figure. I am tall and slim and found the cut to be too big for my hips. I think I should have ordered the tall version too- as the hips of the dress landed closer to my waist. Finally, note that it is extremely low cut. Could be a perk depending on the look you are going for, but if you are looking for something with more modest coverage, this isn't the right pick.","January 12, 2020","Large"

Simple yet sooo glam, plus the material is thick enough to hold you in and smooth your figure, yet so stretchy, it's crazy comfortable, too. The slit is pretty high, which I think makes it feel a bit dressier than you might expect, although I definitely think it could be worn fairly casually if you styled it right. In terms of sizing, this is a typical stretchy bodycon. For more structured dresses with less give, I often have to size up a bit because I have broad shoulders and wear a 34F, but the size small fit me like a glove, and my guess is s medium would have worked fine, too.","January 29, 2019","Other"

I am small chested and didn't quite fill out the top but it still looked good. The slit is very high and can open up a ton...be careful if wearing outdoors and the wind catches.

It was still too small in the chest for me to clasp it, but it worked unclasped and I just had a lot of cleavage (which I'm fine with). Waist has a good amount of give with smocking in the back and the slit, while high, was not a problem for me at all.

So different than anything I've worn for a black tie wedding, and very comfortable. Either size would have fit but the chest was falling a bit weird in the 1 so I went with the 2 (the ties made it easy to size up or down). The only thing that was tough was that the slit is high up so any wind blew the dress open. I had to hold it closed when we weren't inside.","November 3, 2019","Wedding"

The chest and leg slit were no problem for me, maybe size down for better luck there. The long ties in the back were not super-obvious from the photos so I didn’t realize they were even there until I tried it on. I wrapped both the ties around the front and tied it in a small bow in the back: just a knot just looked sorta sad.

I liked how the gold wasn't rhinestones or super flashy, but actually part of the fabric. I do agree with other reviews that the slit is very high, not a problem when you're standing or walking, but when you sit down or if you twirl too much on the dance floor, it gapes open. I safety pinned it a little further down from the top so it wouldn't open too far, but still left plenty of room for a dramatic look. The top is low cut, but it didn't bother me and I don't think showed too much off. I had to use a safety pin just to stop it from gaping underneath the clasp it comes with. It is very light and easy to wear. The shoulders can get a little itchy (because it is not lined like the rest of the dress), but it didn't bother me. I got the 1L and it was perfect!

It's really stunning in person. The dress is airy, comfortable, and very sparkly. Perfect for a glamorous spring/summer event. I received compliments all night. My only complaint is the placement of the high slit. It's in the middle, rather than on the side, so unless you want to expose your cooch all night, it's not a very fun detail. I ended up using a few safety pins to relocate the slit to the side so I could show some leg without worrying about flashing people. As for fitting, I felt it ran a bit large. The shoulder/bust area were very loose. Since the waist is stretchy and forgiving, I'd recommend going a size down, unless you're already top heavy.","June 12, 2019","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BSH56","RTR Customer","Gorgeous showstopping dress!","I was attending a huge televised awards show in New York City and I wanted something appropriately fancy and fun but also flattering. This dress did it all! It had sleeves, which I really wanted but felt impossible to find, a cinched waist, an A-line shape, a V-neck, and was a stunning shimmery gold. I got so many compliments and was stopped by people all over telling me how great I looked! I am only 5'3"" and wore about 2 1/2 in block heels and the length was manageable, although I had to be a little bit careful about not stepping on the hem. Because I am on the shorter side and not as busty, I did use some fashion tape and pins to make sure the V-neck didn't slip too low, but those were enough even without using the snap that's sewn in (although anytime I sat, I snapped it closed, just in case!). The way the skirt meets in the middle actually makes the dress super easy to get on and off but if you're worried about the slit flying open when you're getting up and down, you might want to pin it (I did!). Otherwise, such a stunning dress, when it hit the light it looked amazing. I was on TV later in the evening and got so many messages from friends and family who spotted me right away because I was glowing. I was super comfortable and felt beautiful all night. Rent this dress, you won't regret it!","June 11, 2019","Formal Affair"

The length wasn't as long as some have described. I wore about two inch heels and had no problem getting around. The material and fit was very flattering. I'd say the only slight drawback was the low cut neckline. I'm a 32DD but had a hard time filling the bust out. I had to use dress tape to tape the lower parts together so too much cleavage didn't show. Overall, great experience!","June 4, 2019","Wedding"

It's light and breathable in a crowded ballroom and a total stunner! I received so many compliments throughout the night. For reference, I'm 5,9 130lbs and wore the 0L. The 0R would have been long enough for flats or cute dressy sandals, but the OL was the perfect floor sweeping length for my heels. There are a few ways you can wear the sash - I decided to knot mine to the side. I removed one star for the slight breakage of the metallic threading in a few areas of the dress, most likely due to several wears and cleanings (only really noticeable when looking at it closely) and for the height of the slit. I had to fashion tape it near the top to prevent any possible wardrobe malfunctions. Overall, a great dress!","May 22, 2019","Formal Affair"

I had to use 3 safety-pins to feel somewhat secure that the wrap neckline wouldn't gape. But I'm pushing DDD these days. I wanted the long version but it came with a torn hem. The back-up regular length ended up working just fine. It's longer in back than in front. Also, the front slit is high! But it doesn't show except when you sit & it's easy to fold one side over the other.","May 19, 2019","True to Size"

I would have normally ordered the 8 but reading other reviews about the high slit I opted for the 10. The 10 fit great and is so forgiving. If you have a tummy pooch this does an awesome job concealing it. This was so comfy and I felt like a million buck-a-Roos. It’s a bit low in the front for what I normally pick out but I’m sure had to do with it being a 10. The straps are not adjustable otherwise I would have made them a bit tighter. I didn’t wear a bra and wore spanx for extra support but did have to roll them up on my legs so they wouldn’t show with the slit. When I sat down I just put my hands folded over where the slit was, otherwise it would be a close call, if ya know what I mean. I’d probably recommend sizing up a size, I’m super glad I did.

It was still very flattering though, and overall I felt great wearing it. I pinned the slit about two inches lower than where it naturally separated which helped somewhat, but there was still a lot of leg showing when I sat down or danced, as other reviews have suggested. I was drawn to the unique color but also worried about how it'd look on my fair skin. With a little bit of tanning lotion I felt like it didn't wash me out at all.

This dress was beautiful!","This dress is great for a formal occasion, I was very pleased with it. I ordered a 4R and a 2R as my back up, I ended up wearing the 2R. I typically wear a size 4 but when I first tried the 4R on it was kind of loose in the chest area between my bust and neckline. The 2R fit great other than the length but they were out of 2P or 4P when I ordered so I expected it would be a little too long being 5'1"". I just used hem tape and it worked out fine. The material is thick & stretchy and fit snug. I felt comfortable all night in this dress.","January 1, 2020","Large"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BM580","Emily","Effortless Elegance!","I loved this dress! The only problem was it was about two inches too long and I kept getting my heel caught in the bottom hem of the dress. I'm 5'4"" and I wish I would've looked for the dress in petite. It definitely garnered some gasps! I felt like it made my arms look long and slender because the cut exposed my shoulders. It is duel toned, navy and black. If I were to borrow this dress again, I would probably invest in some platform heels versus stillettos.","December 17, 2019","Formal Affair"

I felt like royalty in this dress. The back is open for a couple about 3-4 in below where your bra strap would be, so wear stick ons. The cut on the sides fit my bust, but you could easily use some fashion tape if you're prone to side boob. I got both a 2 & 4, but decided to go for the 4 because it runs true to size and I didn't want it to look body-con.

The only advice I would give is, if you're an A cup or smaller, then you'll need to get some padding.

It is a heavier material so it hung great and fit perfectly. My only issues: you must have larger breasts to fill out the top so I had to wear an add a cup bra but the back is very low. You need a low back bra if you have to wear padding. The slit is very high on the leg so Spanx will show unless the legs are super short. Overall I got lots of compliments and the dress is pretty comfortable.","May 18, 2019","Formal Affair"

I cannot say enough good things about this dress, and it saved my weekend as the other dress I rented was a complete disaster. I wore it to an art exhibit in the evening, then an informal BBQ the day after. I felt neither underdressed or overdressed at either, and the dress stayed comfortable throughout. Didn't need to use fashion tape at all. I usually don't look good in these ruffle-y monstrosities, but seriously, as soon as I put this on, it was incredible. Sash keeps your figure accentuated but the ruffles add a lot of forgiveness without completely engulfing you. I'm 5'2"", and wore 5"" wedges in the evening, then flip flops during the BBQ. I just adjusted the straps and voila, perfect length. Why don't all maxis come with adjustable straps? Seriously, this is the most well designed maxi I've had the pleasure of knowing.","September 25, 2017","True to Size"

My first impression was that it was much more blue than I had imagined, but I reviewed photos and it's pretty similar to what's shown. More of a silk than a chiffon. The slip was a little tight around the bust (34D) and the length was a little shorter than I'd prefer (5'8) so I'd consider sizing up if you are tall/well endowed.

Running true to size, we definitely recommend sizing up for your backup, especially for women with larger busts. This is a style that is best for A-C cups, as it is fitted at the top, and should be worn with a strapless bra but can be worn without one as well. Although the fabric has no stretch, this is a loose, flowy style from the waist down, and has comfortable room at the hips. At 5'5"" with 3"" heels, this was a floor length style on me. Paired with wedges and gold jewelry, you'll be summer ready!","June 9, 2017","True to Size"

Looking back at photos, I miss this dress and wish I had it in my closet. I highly highly recommend this for formal occasions. I got tons of compliments. I'm taller (5'8) and wore three inch heels so the dress length hit perfectly.","October 20, 2019","Wedding"

That being said, the L and the XL weren't far off from one another. Not much give in this dress, but it's still comfy and not scratchy. Loved it, wish I could've kept it!","October 13, 2019","Wedding"

I felt so beautiful in this dress and I was even the first to wear this particular one as the tag was still attached! I am typically a size 8, needing room in the hips but can fit into a 6 if the hips are less form fitted. The Medium on this was snug in the hips on me, but in no way unwearable. I was comfortable all night! Overall a spectacular option to feel special, yet classic.","October 12, 2019","Wedding"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP41","Gina","Fit can be funny","I am 5'4 about 145 .. I wore the medium because my selected size small didn't ship. It's a thick lace with no stretch that is nice but unless you get a newer dress it will likely be stretched out from other people wearing it a bit snug themselves . I could have definitely fit in the small and it would have looked a bit better/ more fitted but overall the dress was nice. I had to trim some threads and reinforce a strap that was on its last leg as well.","September 17, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP41","RTR Customer","Great dress for a late summer wedding","The fit was perfect for my body type. It kept everything in nice and snug.

I had to adjust the straps a lot, but they were adjustable which was a huge bonus.","September 4, 2019","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP41","RTR Customer","Loved this dress, fabulous color!","Loved this dress! Rented for a black tie optional evening wedding. I ordered an XS, my normal size; it was a little snug but still zipped up and I could move/dance around in it. I’m very short, but with heels the dress fell to a length I liked. The dress didn’t look too long on me, especially since the slip underneath was shorter than the embroidered top layer. I ordered a S as a backup, it fit but was a little loose around the waist and was a bit long (even with heels). The dress was beautiful and I received many compliments on it. I felt great all night and could dance around comfortably.","September 4, 2019","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/DTP41","Kendall","Perfect dress for a wedding","Received compliments on this dress all night! Perfect for those who have larger busts, I felt supported and wasn't adjusting my top all night. Adjustable straps were key! If you have wider hips I'd recommend you go up a size, could be a bit narrow. Definitely need a heel if you're on the shorter side so the dress isn't too long. Color looks dark here but photographs in better light really well.","September 3, 2019","Wedding"

The perfect amount of class and sexy. I love this style of a dress, it's flattering to my more athletic shape. I'm an 8/10 and have worn both medium and large sizes from RTR so I love getting both because it definitely depends on the dress/style and fabric for me. I am bigger on the bottom than the top.

I was worried it would be small on me but this dress fit perfectly! It was very comfortable and I was able to wear a strapless bra (and the dress held it up all night). It was great for dancing and I got a lot of compliments on it. My only complaint is that the material is a little heavy, so it's not the best option for an outdoor August wedding and it had a few small rips in the lace, but it was easy to hide.","August 19, 2019","True to Size"

Everyone was saying how gorgeous and sparkly the dress was 😍 I wore it with gold shoes and I think it went perfectly!

I ended up just buttoning one of them to keep the sleeves in place. The button portion goes along your entire forearm so it's also not possible to roll up the sleeves. The lace and color of this top are gorgeous. I paired it with mom jeans and flats. The top isn't as transparent as it looked in the photos, so I was able to wear a nude bra underneath and wear the top to work without it being too revealing.

Running small with no stretch, I recommend wearing a size up for your primary size. This style is fitted and comfortable throughout the midsection and formfitting at the hips. Curvier women should consider sizing up for full hips. It works best for A - C cups sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress, so you should wear a nubra or no bra since the dress is cut so low in the back. At 5'4, the length hit mid-thigh on me. Light-as-air ruffles elegantly drape off this flirty, floral-print dress styled in sheer chiffon for ethereal charm.

Maybe with a fitted tee/bodysuit and heels for a summer date night? Agree with other reviewers that the sizing is way off, the waist is super tight and then there's a ton of fabric that gives the hips a lot of volume.

Fabric is stretchy, and I had no issue moving about, I just felt a little self-conscious about my belly. It would have been better if I'd sized up. My daughter wears a 4 and it was only a little loose on her, so it fit like a 6.

I wore this to Thanksgiving with the family and it was very comfortable. Because of the faux leather detail on the rim of the skirt and sleeves, I paired this with black tights, engineer boots, and a leather jacket. The dress was true to size.

I thought the cut was very attractive and I felt great!","I really liked the length and the fact that the dress had a bit of a sleeve. At first when I put it on, I thought the gathering at the front looked a little different, but once I added heels and jewelry, I had changed my mind. It was very flattering and the color was beautiful. The fabric had just the right stretch. I am at the top of my 'comfortable' weight range, and I still thought it was complimentary to my figure.","December 27, 2019","True to Size"

I thought the slit across the top would be too revealing, but it was just right. The only thing I didn’t like was the dress has no zipper, so I had to put it on before doing my hair and makeup.","December 15, 2019","True to Size"

The sleeves are a slightly different material and all of it is gorgeous. Let me say, though. Don't. Do not do the following 1. Put on deodorant or 2.finish your hair before the dress goes on.

I nearly didn't rent it because I thought it might be a bit boring, but I'm so glad I changed my mind.

You really can't go wrong with all the Chiara dresses that have the similar design; RTR carries them in different colors and sleeve lengths and I have worn them all; they don't disappoint. I am between a 2 and a 4 and feel the 4 fits me better as the 2's are tighter and you can't move well especially the arms.

I hate my arms, so was very happy to have 3/4 sleeves. I am 5'3"" and it hit just below my knee. The material is similar to a wetsuit- thick and tight. I felt super confident because it helped hold in all that jiggles. (I did wear longline spanx-type thigh to waist underwear to avoid pantylines). Easiest to put on by stepping into the dress, and pulling it up (rather than overhead). I would definitely rent it again!","September 30, 2019","Wedding"

I will absolutely be renting this again, however, I plan to go down, a size. I was concerned about this fitting too tight against my tummy, which I consider my problem area, but the pleats mask anything you don't love and it runs a teeny bit big.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/LAP36","Deborah","Compliments all night long!","Overall impression: This dress was incredible. Pics do not do it justice! I had strangers coming up to me telling me how good I looked. That has not happened since I was in my 20s!! (I am 35 now.) And I received compliments galore from my friends and co-workers all night. It was incredible! About the dress: I usually wear a size 10 dress. I am a size 12 on top (due to a large cup size) and an 8 on bottom. The size 46 (10) worked the best for me in this dress. I also tried the 44 (8) and 48 (12). They all could have worked due to the type of fabric used, but I liked the fit of the 12 the best around the shoulders. It can be worn both on (similar to what I did) or off (like some of the other reviewers) the shoulder. On the shoulder was more conservative and more appropriate for the type of event I was attending. About the intimates: I wore both a strapless bra and spanks with the dress. The smaller size showed the lines of my bra in the back, but the size I ended up wearing did not. As a size G cup, this dress did not have the support to go without a bra, but wearing the strapless bra was no problem. About the designer: I have worn a number of dresses from this designer (La Petite Robe di Chiara Boni) and enjoy the fit of the dresses and the feel of the fabric. If you have not tried a La Petite Robe dress before, be prepared for a very thick material (think scuba swim suit) that fits your body. Step into the dress for best results.","May 3, 2019","True to Size"

If you need bra support it may not work because a strapless might show lines too much. Mine are implants so I just wore the liner things that go inside bikini tops and that was just so I wasn't on ""alert"" because the dress is only lightly lined. The fabric reminded me of a wetsuit and it's very flattering. I want to buy this dress outright I loved it so much","May 3, 2019","Formal Affair"

Unfortunately, it was clear to me that RTR had NOT dry cleaned the dress prior to sending it to me, as it smelled horribly of B.O. when I unpackaged it. Luckily, I was able to fix that prior to my event but it definitely made me feel gross and may make me reconsider renting again in the future.","September 23, 2019","Large"

This one definitely fit differently - it wasn't quite as flattering in the top and seemed to run smaller (I had to ask my husband a couple times if he thought the short side was too short), but it wasn't a big enough difference that I didn't like the dress.

It would be perfect for someone with narrow hips and a larger bust as it has a true A-line skirt and the entire top is slightly bloused. I have a small and narrow chest and wider hips, so I felt like the top looked saggy but I don’t think sizing down to an XS would work in the hips, which were comfortably snug on me in the Sm. I didn’t end up wearing it - I would have worn it to work but it ended up being sort of an extra item for the number of work days I had and I didn’t like it enough to keep it through the weekend for the next appropriate time to wear, so I sent it back for something else.","March 1, 2019","True to Size"

I'm normally a US 4 and sized up to a 38 for this and am glad I did. It fit snugly and well, no way a smaller size would have worked. It's VERY low cut, in my opinion too low for a wedding so I used double sided tape to raise the neckline - what you see in the pic is way higher than it is without tape. It's short!!

I think wearing it with leggings and boots gives it a good casual everyday look. The material is awesome. Feels great on. Fit was weird for me. Top fit perfect, but too small on my hips, causing the front hem to roll weird and show the underlining. I'll probably wear it once and send it back.

I wore a camisole underneath, as it is low cut, but would be fine for a night out. The dress shifts a little bit throughout the day, so I had to be careful of readjusting. I think the way the dress is cut in the midsection is really flattering for apple shapes; it conceals the tummy and highlights what semblance of a waistline you might actually have. The hem of the dress flares out into a sort of asymmetrical tulip shape. It's cool- but, I teach high school. I had to calculate my accessories wisely. I wore it with ballet flats. I don't normally do shoulder pads, but these added to the dress; they were fun. The fabric is comfortable and there's a lot of room to experiment with a look, so I'd encourage anyone to try this dress out knowing there might be some issues with length.","May 11, 2019","Small"

I could also see this going well work to dinner. I have a 29 inch waist and 38 inch hip & think the 4 may have been too tight; the 6 was just a tad loose but looked nice and was comfortable.

The only drawback was that this dress seemed very well loved: some of the thread keeping the red lace at the bust was falling off the silk underneath, so it was a little floppy and sloppy.

Super flattering and hugged me in all the right places. Only con would be the fact that the slip underneath isn't attached and will show more when you sit down. Overall very comfy and form fitting.

This dress was gorgeous and made me feel like I was glowing all night. Honestly, I never wanted to take it off. It was lightweight, vibrant, and fun. I also thought the pattern and the ruffles were slimming.

I wore this to a religious service in the morning and a bridal shower later that day. The day was very hot but I felt very comfortable, probably because this is silk. I did need to press the dress before wearing. Due to the ruffles it took a while but the dress looked so much better after ironing. This is a true wrap - the waist tie is the only thing that holds it together. No internal hooks or snaps, except for the bra strap thread at the shoulders. I also got the 10 as a backup but that gaped open so wide across my chest that I quickly put it aside. The 12 had much better coverage but was still pretty deep open - like down to the lower part of my bra. I paired a navy blue silk camisole and solved that. No pockets. So many compliments.

It's a nice, fine corduroy material - perfect for fall - and extremely comfortable. Like a pajama, but for work. I couldn't really figure out how to do the waist tie, so I ended up wrapping the strings around my entire waist and tying them in the back. Did a good job of pulling the silhouette in, since loose jumpsuits sometimes have a tendency to make you look boxy. I'm on the shorter side (5'5"") and was worried that the Small would be too long for me, but it fit very well. The only thing I will say is that the shoulders, at least on me, stood out way more than the shoulders on the model in the picture - almost like a David Byrne ""big suit"" vibe (or an 80s shoulderpad) due to the blousing. I balanced it out by adding a slim gold necklace, and ended up liking the funkiness of this jumpsuit, but be aware that this essentially has shoulderpads.","October 24, 2019","True to Size"

The 8 fit me perfectly.","February 9, 2020","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SAL58","Di","Pretty dress that you can easily pump in.","I rented this dress for an outdoor wedding in the beginning of September 3.5 months postpartum. I rented it because it was pretty, I could wear a regular bra with it and it had a zipper in the back which would allow me to easily to take down the top portion when I needed to pump (I was happy that the zipper in the back was easy enough for me to zip up and down by myself). The dress was not heavy even though it looks like a lot of fabric, and was the perfect length to wear flats (I'm only 5' 3""). I'm 144lbs post-baby, so I had to guess my size based on the reviews of other ladies. I ordered the 10 and 12 as a back-up, and although they basically fit the same (the 12 was just slightly looser in the hips), I went with the 10 because the 12 looked much more worn out. The top cleavage area was a little too low on me (I think if I had a longer torso it would be perfect), so it showed my bra a bit. I just used a safety pin to pin it a little higher than the little clasp on the dress and it was fine. I was happy with the rental overall!","September 2, 2019","Wedding"

The 6 was a little more body hugging but since I wanted to be comfortable & didn't want to wear spanx, I went with an 8. I'm 5'1"" and with heels it doesn't touch the floor.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/REF1","Natalie","Super versatile and comfortable","I rented this as part of my update for the month. I wore it 4 times, which says a lot about how many different ways this works! I wore it dressed up for the holidays and out to dinner, I wore it walking around New Orleans on vacation, and I even wore it to work with a blouse over the top. Generally I wore it without a bra, which is typical for me, but you could wear it with a strapless. The straps do fall down, there's nothing you can really do about it, it has to do with where they are sewn on the bodice. Pockets are a plus, though they are shallow. I'm 5'2'' and it was a bit longer on me than the model, as expected, but not weird. Felt like a million bucks, considered buying it. Definitely fitted in the waist, so take that into consideration when sizing. I typically wear a 4-6, and I'm in between a S and M, but my waist is very defined. I went with the 4 and it was tight in the waist, but not uncomfortable.","January 15, 2020","True to Size"

I love that it could be easily worn dressed up or down. I added a jean jacket for church and it looked very cute. It's such a simple dress but still a head turner because it moves beautifully. My only negative comment for the dress would be the straps. They are adjustable but very flimsy so even with the right tightness they loosen and fall a bit. So just know you'll need to have perfect posture to keep those straps in place. All in all I would recommend and rent again!","April 2, 2019","Everyday"

I wore it to my boyfriend's work party where we ate dinner, and danced all night and it was perfect. The top of the dress was much stretchier than I anticipated (which was actually really nice). It fit me perfectly without feeling like I was being squeezed to death. I go back and forth between size 4 and 6 in dresses, but in this case the 6 was perfect for me. I also wore 3 inch heels with the dress and I loved the mid-calf length on me. The only negative thing I would say is the straps are super wide set, so they were kind of rubbing and digging into my armpits throughout the night. However, I also have pretty broad shoulders so that may have just been the way it fit on me. The straps are also super delicate, so they kept falling off my shoulders - but neither of those should be deal-breakers though because overall the dress was super comfortable and fun to wear.

Based on reviews, I thought I would be a size S, however the dress was gaping on the side for me, so I definitely should have gotten an XS.

I ended up using two safety pins and pinning about 2 inches at the underarm area where it zipped. And then added a little double sided tape as an extra precaution.

Running true to size with no stretch, I recommend wearing your true size,for your primary size. (add if true to size) and going up for your back up. Women who are curvier should consider sizing up. This style is fitted at the bust, fitted throughout the midsection and, comfortable at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are able to wear a standard bra with this dress. At 5’3, the length hits mid-thigh knee length on me. The floral print is perfect for the spring weather coming.","April 5, 2019","True to Size"

The dress is more fitted than I expected and hugs the waist. Beware: There is a huge hole on the left side of the dress. Very odd design but I am sure it is made a for a tall, skinny person.

The cut/drape is amazing with a bit of asymmetry a lot of flow, the fabric has sheen, it's really unique and yet can easily be dressed up or down with the right fierce attitude. I had people stopping me in the street to compliment me. Note that it's pretty revealing. A bra would peek through the side open sleeve thing and the lines would be lame anyway. If you are confident enough to wear this dress, this shouldn't be a concern with today's trends. I'd find the most seamless pair of nude undies you can to pair with this. You don't want panty lines distracting from it - and it will show even the most subtle of lines.

It is very well-suited for someone very tall and very slim. The dress has a lovely drape and looks extremely expensive ( which it is!) but it is very unforgiving due to being cut on the bias.

It actually fit fine except for the length of the torso - the arm holes felt very small I think just because I was longer from my shoulder to my waist. Little scratchy there becomes it was pulling.

Running true to size with some stretch at the waist, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and going up for your back up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection with an elastic waist and loose at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are able to wear a standard bra with this dress. At 5’4”, the length hit mid-thigh with the slip underneath and tea length for the rest of the sheer fabric. The metallic circle pattern on the dress is amazing in person and makes it unique.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MNL246","Catherine","Will try again with this one!","This dress was my original first choice for my friend's 40th Birthday Weekend trip. Unfortunately, my size 14 wasn't returned on time and I only got my backup size (16) in this dress -- although RTR's stellar customer service sent me an AMAZING replacement in time for my event, so no complaints. This dress is adorable, flattering, and so much fun in person. It also runs a full size too big, in my opinion. I ended up wearing a size 14 and a size 16 that weekend in other RTR dresses, so I can definitely wear both sizes... but this size 16 had room for a size 2 to climb in with me. I'm 5'10, 170ish, 36F/G, and measure 42-34-42. Typically, I have trouble getting the bust section of dresses to zip, but as you can see, I was swimming in this one. Waistline is elasticated, and has good stretch, but was also pretty loose on me. Loved the dress, but I'll try again in a 12. I'd recommend getting your true size and sizing down as your backup, unless you're smaller ok top... then maybe size down once for your primary pick and twice for your backup.","December 9, 2018","Party"

It works best for all cup sizes and is comfortable at the bust. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this jumpsuit so you should wear, nubra or no bra since the back is low cut.

First, I could zip/unzip it myself (hallelujah). And while the material is very thick, it wasn't overly hot for an 80 degree wedding. The cut of the jumpsuit is extremely flattering - I was worried about the wide leg pant but may be now on board with this trend. I sized up 2 sizes from my normal size, and was happy I did so. It was comfortable and I wasn't worried about it pulling and the pockets bulging out. It was also a perfect length - I'm 5'10. I wore with silver ankle strap heels, rhinestone earrings and a statement red lip. Got so many compliments and most of all was comfortable and looks fantastic in pictures (this is a first!).","October 16, 2018","Wedding"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TYB56","RTR Customer","This jumpsuit is EVERYTHING","My favorite rental so far. So glam and chic. Very well made, the fabric is very thick and substantial. Would not recommend for an outside affair in hot weather- you may sweat to death. But we were in Cali on the coast and it was perfect for a 60 degree evening. It runs small- one full size small. Trust me. Thank goodness I read the other reviews. I'm a true XS/zero and ended up ordering a 2 and a 4 for backup. The size 2 was perfect. Would not have wanted to try to zip anything smaller. It needs to be fitted to be flattering- the waist is the best part. Draws you in before the wide leg. The button details make it. I'm short and wore with 4 inch heels and it was perfect. You don't need high heels because it runs long per se, you need high heels to counteract the wide leg. The zipper was a bit tricky but that's to be expected with the thick fabric. I want to buy this.","September 15, 2018","Small"

I was nervous getting the two and even cancelled the order to order the size 2 and size 6 as my back order ( four wasnt in stock) I did this because on the tory burch website the size 2 was a XXS (NO THANKS). I finally tried on the size 2 and it was actually perfect! I was also nervous because i've gained 7-10 pounds ( 110 to 120)and didn't know if I was the size four because of this. I believe if I was 110 I would have been the size zero. I am currently 5'2 and 117-120 pounds with most of weight in my legs with a small waist and no butt. I am a 32 C and the chest was fine. The size 6 was waaay to big on me. I recieved tons of compliments from people at my boy friend's law school graduation to the waitresses at the lunch after.","May 17, 2018","Other"

I wore this without a bra and I was completely fine however it would have filled out a little better. I'm glad I went with the six regular because it did run a little bit small I believe. Although I think I probably could have squeezed into a four. And no major jewelry pieces needed I just work really blingy earrings I got so many compliments I even had a complete stranger stop in the on the side of the road when I parked my car asking me where I got my outfit or just complementing me out of the blue. That rarely happens to me. This is a stunning piece I wish I could afford just buying it out right!!!

It is so glam! Everyone - friends, strangers, bartenders - commented on how amazing it is. One friend kept telling me all night “there is no way you can send that back - it is so cute!” Apologies for the bad pic. I almost forgot to take one so quick threw it on after getting home at the very end of the night. I thought it might be helpful for other tall ladies to see how it fits. I’m 5’11” with a small chest and a pretty true size 10 in everything, and the L was almost too small. I don’t know that I would have worn it if it were any shorter or smaller in the chest (I could just comfortably fasten it closed).

This piece runs true to size so I would recommend getting your usual size as your primary and going up one size for the backup size. The style is fitted throughout the midsection and fitted in the hip area. Curvier women should consider sizing up for full hips. This dress is great for all cup sizes and should be worn with a strapless bra. In regards to length, this dress hit me at mid thigh. I love the intricate lace detailing on this dress and the fun, flirty skirt at the bottom of the dress. I would pair this with black heels (as pictured), some fun earrings and a neutral toned small handbag.","January 14, 2019","True to Size"

Three layers of beautiful, lace detailed material for the skirt - but not too much poof for a bar. NOTE - the dress is slightly see-through and very see-through on the bottom. You must wear real leggings (not just tights) or your butt will show (I am short and this was still the case). The top was a little tight but not uncomfortable but I could not have sized up because the waist was slightly loose. Despite sheer top, not too sexy / revealing. Overall, beautiful. Aim to dress down (a leather/denim jacket and sneakers would look great).","January 12, 2019","Everyday"

I wish I could have worn it without all the under layers because it's see through in areas that make it much more delicate. Length is plenty long where you don't need tights. I'm a 36DD and the girls fit fine. Had some extra room in the trunk & hips but I don't have much on that end.","January 11, 2019","Date"

Running small with very little stretch, I recommend wearing a size up for your primary size. This style is tight throughout the midsection and tight at the hips. It works best for A-C cups sizes, since it's fitted at the bust. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress, so you should wear a strapless bra since the dress has a square neckline. At 5'5, the length hit knee length on me. The short ruffle sleeves are the highlight of this dress and gives off a festive vibe. Pair with black heels and an envelope clutch to complete your outfit!","February 27, 2019","Small"

I would call it understated, classy and comfortable. The sleeves give it the added fun. It's not really a wow dress but it was right for me for the night. ( didn't want to stand out too much). I had my friend pin the top of the sleeves to my bra, because it felt like they could slide down. This worked perfectly and I had no problem. I wore a regular black bra.

The true waist and skater skirt nicely covers over any less than desirable tummy. A tshirt bra can be worn underneath no problem. However, I'm 5'6 (I wore the small) and would not wear this much as it's right on the edge of comfortable length for this style of skirt. I like to sit and have the skirt cover my bottom, any shorter and that would not have been the case. It did make a great rental.","October 9, 2019","Party"

Comfortable fabric and doesn't wrinkle. Cons: the fit was just big in all the wrong ways on my hourglass frame. I think if I had sized down it would have been too short and too tight across my bust. In the XL, it was pretty roomy between my chest and my waist. Then the skirt just pooped a little too much a little too soon. It ended up reading boxy. Tips: a cardigan that ended at my hips helped create a better silhouette.","August 1, 2019","Work"

It can be smart or casual, daytime or nighttime, worn with sneakers or even heels. I know I'll wear this a bunch so I bought it so I can use my RTR subscription for other items that are more one-off. Initially I tried the size 2 and 4 but even with my bra size, the 2 fit best. Also, this dress manages to make it look like you have more curves, without being tight.

The cut in front is quite low. So if you have a larger chest, or boobs that are friends (aka close together) it might feel a bit too revealing. The split flutter sleeves are adorable. The waist is super flattering, though a touch fitted if you have a larger rib cage. Hips are forgiving. I'm usually a size 8 and felt it fit well, but i could've made a 10 work, not a 6.

Luckily, when I finally got a dress, it was perfect. The material is stretchy and thick so I didn’t need to wear shapewear to smooth lines. Both the 8L and 10L fit well, but I went with the 8L because I felt a bit better with a slightly tighter fit. I am 5’ 8” and wore 3.5” heels and the length was perfect. I didn’t wear a bra but you could certainly wear a backless one. I usually have a tough time with dresses fitting in both the waist and hips as my hips aren’t proportional to my waist, but the front slit really helped give me the tiny bit of room necessary to accommodate both.

I added a brooch to cinch the waist a bit as it was a bit big in the waist. I hate Italian sizing but once you get over the need to order a ridiculously large number size, the dress is lovely. The cape made me feel like a super hero. But a fabulous one. Fabric is a little thicker but soft and kinda comforting. It was a perfect dress for a girls night out wine event!","June 12, 2019","Other"

The dress was stretchy and super comfortable and I got lots of compliments on it, especially the color. I have difficulty finding dresses because my bust is a size or two larger than my waist and hips. The stretching of the fabric made this not a problem and at the same time the dress didn't feel tight.

The color is outstanding and I got so many compliments. I generally wear a size 2-4 and went with the US equivalent of a 2 because that's what was in-stock but may have been able to wear a 4. The material is thick and holds you in but you can't hide much in this dress. With some spanx and a Nu-bra I felt amazing. I have a long torso, small chest, and bigger butt, but the dress hugged perfectly. The armpits were a bit tight but ultimately didn't bother me.

However, unless you are really confident about the shape of your midsection or own really great seamless Spanx, this may not work for you. I found the smooth and tight fabric (no zipper- you slide into it like a sausage casing) to be unforgiving in that it shows every lump and bump in the middle. Spanx helped but not enough. I'm a size 4-6 but wouldn't return to this dress unless I am feeling super fit. Great color and it seemed comfortable.","December 4, 2019","Formal Affair"

It somehow felt really dressy and special while being effortless and casual at the same time, which was perfect for the barn wedding I wore it to. I wasn't sure whether I should wear the XS or the Small, because the XS was a little too snug around the thighs, but the Small looked baggy. I went with the XS, which turned out to be the right decision because the dress loosened up slightly within a few hours and fit perfectly.","May 19, 2018","True to Size"

Pro: Color is beautiful and vibrant, the pockets were a perfect touch, length in the 4 Regular fit well on my 5 Ft 4 inch Frame. Con: Cold shoulder straps were undone by the seams, and wouldn’t stay up. Half way through the event I tucked into the dress. Zipper a little challenging to zip, but once up it stayed put.

It fit very well, and the fabric is a beautiful, with gorgeous colors that are rich and romantic (without being overly feminine or kitsch) in person. The heavy weight fabric made it structured and lovely. The strap that is semi attached to the sleeves kept sneaking up, so I sewed it in place temporarily for the event. It worked well. It is a heavier material which was not ideal for a tropical setting, but well worth it.","March 18, 2019","Formal Affair"

My only issue with it is that it runs VERY large for those of us who are not well endowed . I am 5'10 and very lanky with no curves. I typically wear a 4 in dresses and the 4 was gigantic.

Such a unique dress. Flattering shape. Rich fabric almost like a tapestry. Vibrant pattern and colors. Pockets. Contrary to previous reviews saying the sleeves were restricting on the dance floor, I did not find this to be a problem. However, the elastic straps that attempt to hold up the sleeves DO show sometimes. I tried to pin them with safety pins but they ended up popping about an hour after. I'm sure no one even noticed and it's a small price to pay for such an awesome dress.","February 23, 2019","Wedding"

The size 2R fit perfectly. I did wear my strapless bra with it but probably could have gone without. Stayed up securely, no tugging up necessary. Flattering shape, but plenty of room to eat and drink without discomfort. Only complaint is the straps for hanging the dress poked out a few times throughout the night. It was so much fun to wear this! It felt like a work of art- definitely formal enough for a black tie affair but could have been a stunning piece at a cocktail party too. The pockets are a good size- kept a small wallet, pack of tissues, lip gloss and iphone very comfortably. It photographs well. I wish I had more events in my life so I could buy this dress and wear it to every one! I loved it so much I never even tried on my back-up dress.","February 17, 2019","Formal Affair"

I ended up tucking them in the dress and had to do that constantly all night but it didn't make me love it less.

I noticed it was there and there were some constraints but I didn't notice any discomfort or pain.

To compare fit, I'm 5'10"", have broad shoulders and an athletic build. This fit like a glove and a fun, sophisticated alternative to run of the mill party dresses. The zipper was a little sticky but a little candle wax helped it along. I loved the silhouette and the sleeves. It's a perfect fall or winter dress for sure as the fabric has some heft and structure to it.

Pockets made it super cute and helped give yourself a place to put your hands for photos. The fabric was just stretchy enough that I wish I had sized down. By the end of the night, it seemed to have gotten even bigger from all the dancing! I've read reviews about the elastic arm straps showing; I never experienced that problem. They stayed up just fine and never showed in photos, etc. The bust was a little too big for me, but I have a very small bust. I didn't wear a bra because the fabric was so thick, it didn't require it, but I'm sure I could have filled the top in a bit more had I worn one.

It had cut-outs and slits, but didn't feel sexy. And yet it's long with a high neck and you can't wear it to work. I was also really thrown by the fabric. It's a houndstooth pattern but the fabric is slick - now I was wearing it in late spring so definitely didn't want or expect a heavy houndstooth but felt it was still a bit odd. Overall the fit was a bit on the small side. I normally wear a medium but only the large was available and after wearing the large I'm not sure the medium would have been ok. The fit on my butt wasnt great - I would expect a dress like this to hug my body, but instead the fabric pooled a bit.","June 22, 2019","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/UNW6","Amanda","Wore this Dress to a Memorial Service","I usually don't add reviews but when I was looking at ordering this dress, I didn't see a lot of feedback from shorter gals like myself. So, I'd like to provide one for those who are thinking about renting the dress and are 5 ft. I wore this dress to my MIL's Memorial Service. My husband and I hosted the service so I needed something that was both elegant and appropriate. This dress was perfect for the occasion. The quality of the material is absolutely amazing. The fabric and lace is thick and the details on the dress are stunning. The satin band around the waist can be both a blessing and restrictive. On one hand, it is great for creating shape for your body but on the other hand, it makes it hard to move around. Just know, you will have excellent posture in this dress. The length of the dress rested below the knees which allows the slit in the middle to be sexy and feminine yet still conservative/churchy. It was perfect for my particular occasion. RTR dresses can usually run long for 5ft gals. So, again this was a pleasant surprise to have the dress the perfect length. Also, when I sat the slit didn't rise up to over expose my inner thighs. Last, the 6 was a good fit because the 8 (my back up size) provided the right amount of comfortableness around the waist but then the bottom flared out too much and was way too big. This is a dress I would definitely rent again.","August 4, 2019","Other"

I'm a 32DDD, so I didn't have a problem with the top other than the strap length - which was an easy fix. Truly loved this dress.","June 24, 2019","Party"

The kiosk at the front auto populated my information after I put my email in and I had a dressing attendant right on the spot. They could see the frantic rush I was in and got me squared away within 5 minutes. She found the 16L on the rack, I threw it on and it was perfect. She put it in the bag and I was on my way out in total time of 7 minutes. It was 6pm on Saturday and they were busy. I got married on Sunday. I can't thank RTR more than I can.

I had an issue keeping the lace up around my neck. I tried ironing, starching, pinning right before pictures, and I still kept having to check that the lace was not tucking down (in the picture you can see that one side is up and one is down on the front of my neck).

A few things about it that are different than the picture: it is not as shiny as it appears and was longer than I had thought. It runs a little snug on the top, which is great for a strapless dress, but something to consider when renting to go one size higher. The only downsize with renting this dress is that the little hook on the top of the zipper was broke, but the zipper was never an issue.

I ended up wearing the 2, but the chest was very tight. I'm on the shorter side, and I loved where the tea length hit on me, about mid/lower calf.

The embroidery is stunning in person and the length of the dress was perfect. I am 5'4"" and the hem hit me just below mid-shin. This dress was made of a heavier material that would have made it difficult to wear in the summer or in a hot location. I wore this to a winter wedding with black pumps and pink fringe earrings.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS153","RTR Customer","Beautiful and comfortable dress","This dress was my backup style but I ended up wearing it because I loved it more than my original pick and because it fit a bit better. I have a big rib cage, which sometimes causes difficulty with strapless dresses. I sized up one size, and was glad that I did. The dress was a little loose at the top (I don't have a lot to fill out the bust) but the built-in bra helped keep everything snugly in place. We were attending a ""boots and black tie"" gala, so I liked that it was appropriately formal while still allowing me to show off my boots. I got so many compliments on the dress, and I was comfortable all night. And since it has pockets, I didn't even need to carry a purse. It was a little cool out, so I wore a pink pashmina, which was the perfect complement to the dress.","January 17, 2019","Formal Affair"

The straps don't do the best job of staying up and we're a bit pesky all night.

I got an XL, and I normally wear a 14-16. It was a little tight (the XL in this brand is a 12), but with some good shapewear, the dress fit well. I have a larger chest and a bit of a tummy, and a small butt and thighs, so this dress fit well for me.

The fabric is really comfortable, but like the other reviews say, this dress is LONG. I'm 5'9"" and wore 2"" heels and I was still stepping on it. The slit helps so I just held the dress so that I could walk easier with the slit in front. The color is really beautiful, a soft pinky/coral and the sleeves and button detail are really flattering.

I tried wearing black thong spanx under the dress (bc spanx are life) and you could totally see them underneath. The dress is also really long. Tried it with heels, still too long. Despite renting 3 different dresses from RTR and wearing my last resort, RTR was incredibly understanding about everything and refunded me for all three failed rentals- no questions asked.

There is no stretch, so keep your body type in mind, also no zippers, giving it an informal feel while looking fancy, which is perfect. I wish it had some stretch in it, and wish it could go more casual, but it feels pretty dressy on. The built in slip is actually a shorter length underneath, a really nice feature and keeps the whole dress feeling light. Looks so much better in person than in my photo.

I was comfortable in the backup size 4 and didn't feel like it was going to fall down on me. One thing I didn't like about the dress was the back hem. The hem has thicker material at the bottom to weigh it down and I kept getting my heel stuck in it when I would stand up or step backwards.

Pros: 1) this dress accentuated all the right things - shoulder, arms, the girls, upper waist, lower legs. 2) you can eat without getting too uncomfortable (though it's tight on the ribcage so not a complete free-for-all). 3) SO PRETTY you will feel like a princess all night 4) even the bride will compliment your pretty dress . Seriously I've never gotten so many compliments after an event, including my wedding day. 5) POCKETS. I've never actually worn a dress with pockets for an event like this and holy crow I probably won't ever wear one without them again. It was amazing. Cons: you have to send it back. Seriously that's it. People say order a size up. I think it ran a little small but honestly pretty true to size. For reference, I'm breastfeeding and wear a 34DD. Forgot my pump so by the end of the night I was really busting out of the top. Also, I did order the 8 as well, and it was a better fit for my breasts but a little less fitted in the waist, and it was ripped so I decided to squeeze into the 6. I maybe could have worn a bra with the 8, but no way with the 6.","July 14, 2019","Wedding"

I have a small chest and carry most of my weight in my lower half so I expected that the 6R would fit best. Instead I wore the 8R and it fit perfectly. If you want to wear a bra or have a larger bust, I would recommend going up a size.","July 2, 2019","Small"

Friends and strangers complimented me and my dress throughout the evening. I felt absolutely stunning! I'm 5'4, 108 pounds and have a petite chest, so it fit well in the bodice but was rather loose in the chest, even with a push up strapless bra. Overall the dress was comfortable despite the extra room in the chest and it sat well with my heels on but was just short enough I didn't step on it/ it didn't drag when I kicked my heels off!

My favorite are the pockets that can hold essentially anything without adding any bulk to the dress. My biggest frustration with it, however, was that the bottom hem wouldn't lay flat. It looked really weird in most photos I took. But in person, it's a stunner! I think it runs a little small. I'd call this more of a ""2"" fit than a true ""4"".","June 2, 2019","Small"

I wear a 36C bra size, I didn't quite fill in the top so I had to pin it so it wasn't too low cut. I wore spanx underneath because I have a bit of a tummy that needs tucking And I felt like the fabric was so thin I wasn't comfortable with such movement in my derrière.

I would be slightly concerned if I was to wear this out during the day in the sunlight, it isn’t lined and pretty see thru. I wore it to dinner at my in laws for Easter so I wasn’t worried but I think it would need a slip or something. Since it’s a true wrap dress though it would need to be a pretty short slip because the wrap opens when you sit down and cross your legs. It does have an eye hook at the bust but I still needed to wear a cami. My boobs fall out of my bra cause they are just bags of skin. If you have nice perky boobs you shouldn’t need a cami.","April 23, 2019","Everyday"

I was so excited to see this brand available as part of rtr unlimited. Rented for an evening outdoor party this coming weekend and can not wait to wear. The cut is VERY figure flattering, and as with all Yumi Kim dresses the snap in the bust area can give a more modest fit, but if you chose to wear open you can for a more racy look.

The fit was perfect for me. It was a little roomy in the bust (I'm a 32A, so that's not too surprising), and I wore a lacy cami underneath.

Luckily, whoever rented previously left a safety pin on the dress that worked in a pinch for me to keep the dress closed and not reveal too much of my chest. I loved the high-low length and wore this with blush colored flats to work. I will also mention that I wouldn't recommend wearing this on a windy day - I wore a slip underneath for comfort, though you could do without. The dress skirt gets easily blown up with the wind as it's a true wrap and I think the ruffles give it some lift - I especially had to be alert when walking down stairs.

But once you manage to get it on, it's well tailored and the ruffled edges add nice detail. It stayed in place off the shoulders. It's a bit cropped and I paired with high waist jeans. If it was cheaper I would have bought it. Though it was quite worn out and the colors were fading and it had some pulling.","October 6, 2018","Date"

I just politely asked her and my father for a ride to downtown where I spent the rest of the night trying to get a cute picture of this crop top and failing miserably.

The quality is really superb. I will say, they keyhole to the chest is very noticeable and can be a bit..chilly. If you are going for a modest look maybe don't choose this.

I received compliments both times wearing it. I wore with a belt at the waist once, and then without the belt for an even more casual, cool look. The only thing that would make this dress better is pockets! This fits true to size but since it's obviously not fitted, could probably fit a range of sizes pretty well. It's a high-low cut, so longer in the back which I liked. Lots of dimension!","July 23, 2019","Vacation"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/BSH25","RTR Customer","Good but not great","This dress was very comfortable. Lots of room in the arms and the material felt great. The neckline is low so I wore a tank top underneath. Wrapping the dress made the hemline look a bit uneven, and the fabric was slightly crumpled along the neckline. The belt was crumpled as well, so it was not as wide as it is on the model. The shoulders made me feel a bit like a football player. These details made me feel like the dress was good for a casual outing, but I wouldn't want to wear it anywhere where I had to look super polished.","July 22, 2018","Everyday"
