Running true to size with some stretch, I recommend wearing your true size for your primary size and and going down for your back-up. This style is fitted throughout the midsection and loose at the hips. It works for all cup sizes. You are not able to wear a standard bra with this dress, so you should wear strapless since the dress is off the shoulder. At 5'0"", the length hit just above the knee on me. I love the small pineapples on the dress and it adds a little bit of fun to this Spring/Summer dress. Pair with cute sandals and a small purse accessory to complete your outfit!","May 25, 2018","True to Size"

The silhouette had no structure so it just hung all flaccid and fattening. The frills at the mid-arm put it over the top as just fussy and costumish.

The fabric is so forgiving and fits to your curves in a smooth, flattering way. I am VERY pear shaped, so I loved that the hem of the dress fell straight down instead of continuing with the contours of my hips/thighs -- some sweater-type dresses do that and way OVER accentuate my shape, but this dress gave me a perfectly feminine form. The length was also great for my taller-than-average height. The only draw-back was that I felt the stripes hit at weird parts on my body, but this was a very minor con.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/SW623","Melody","Could be nice for going out... not for work","The slit is way too short for work--may not seem like it at first but once you start walking around, it shows a lot of leg. I didn't listen to the sizing down recommendations in other reviews, because I have pretty curvy hips and thought hey, if it's a little loose that could make it more work appropriate. Wrong! I had to pin it at the waist because it was so loose, and the extra room around my legs made the slit situation worse as I walked. I could see myself renting this in a small instead of medium for a night out, but I would never wear this to work again.","August 8, 2019","Large"

Since I have a larger chest and wanted more coverage on top, I ordered one size up (size 12) from my usual RTR size of 10 (for reference, I am 5'8'; 156 lbs; 36C), which worked well. Otherwise, it fits true to size. This dress is 100% silk, with the skirt and the sleeves made out of woven silk with no stretch and the body made out of jersey silk with some stretch. No lining. The sleeves were surprisingly billowy. I ended up not wearing this dress because it was too short-waisted for me (e.g. the waist of the dress was higher than my natural waist) and I couldn't move the belt lower because the fabric changes from red to green at the waist seam.","June 4, 2018","True to Size"

The print is beautiful and bold but doesn't wear you. The bodice is traditional DVF silk knit and the sleeves, skirt and belt are silk charmeuse like a Hermès scarf. It's definitely a beautiful departure from the traditional DVF wrap dress, which is always a good fashion choice in its own right. This runs slightly larger than DVF wrap dresses, which run a full size small. I am a true 6 and got an 8 in this and could have worn a 6. That said, if I were larger chested the 8 would have been fine. I'd advise a skinny tank or nude spanx underneath simply because the white flowers are a bit sheer.

I am built with a long body and shorter legs, so when I read it was long in the torso, I actually got excited. And it is long in the torso, but has these cool snaps to cinch in the waist with 2 different settings. I wore an XLR because I am curvy and like the slightly baggier jump suit look with my curves giving it shape. This worked perfectly for that. The only challenge with long body short legs, is the leg length on this, which is awkward for 5'5"" person. I rolled up, perf for summer, but I feel I look a bit out of proportion when I have them down at full length. Great rent!","August 1, 2019","True to Size"

I then wore it to fly home, and the next day for a day out at Home Depot and a visit to the botanic gardens. Highly versatile, and probably good for almost anyone.

I generally wear a size 4 in VB blazers but this was not roomy. I sent it back without wearing. It's very cute, I personally will size up if I rent again.

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/KS232","RTR Customer","Simply Lovely","If the dress was easier to get into, I'd give it 5 stars. I loved the style and the material was luxurious. The colors and patterns were feminine and perfect to wear to an afternoon graduation party as well as to work. I liked the scarf neckline detail but chose to wear my hair down, thus not showing it off too much. The 14R fit well though getting into it wasn't easy. Doing a side zipper alone can be near impossible, so I actually opted to leave it zipped then gently ease it on over my head. This method required massive flattening of my breasts to fit it. However, once everything was in place, the dress looked great. This method of putting it on also negated the confusion about arm holes that some people noted in their reviews. I was very happy with the rental.","July 3, 2019","Party"

I'm 5'9 and the hem hit me just slightly lower than on the model, so I'd your average/short this dress might be an awkward length for you. Then again, if you're really short it'll probably be a moxi.

I wore it to work and felt like I was floating through meetings, presentations, hallways. Just floating above and through it all. The fit is amazing - the middle hits right above the natural waist in a way that flatters most women. I loved the flowy skirt and the material is sumptuous and feels rich. Finally, the tie around the neck gives it an elegance that you don't normally find in functional work-type dresses. I would have purchased it if I could but it is always unavailable and so hard to get your hand on! If you do, then snatch it up. you won't regret it.","December 20, 2019","True to Size"

I am a true medium in almost everything an felt that this sweater was a just a little bit snug - unsure if it just runs a little small or perhaps the one I rented was washed/dry cleaned and shrunk a little bit. Was definitely still wearable, but as the braiding makes it a bit see through, I had intended on wearing a camisole underneath and was not able to do so because it was a bit tight and short. I will note that the sweater was NOT itchy at allll without anything underneath, which was a huge plus and luckily the see-through-ness from the braiding was hardly noticeable. Would rent again, but would probably go for a size up as I tend to like my sweaters a bit looser (like how it looked like it fit on the model).","February 12, 2020","Small"

The bum felt a bit tight, the bust a bit loose. Even when adjusted to the tightest button that connects on the interior at back, the straps were just a bit too long. Color: The jumpsuit looked almost pale pink, but still came across white, likely because I wore a black linen cardigan with it since we had unexpectedly cool weather. However, I had intentionally ordered a white item for rehearsal dinner. Likely, the one I receive was just dingy from previous wears and washes. Fabric: Heavier than expected - had the weight and feel of canvas. I would not have worn this fabric with metallic heels, as it is styled in the RTR images. I wore with a low-heeled suede sandal, which was more suitable.

It felt a little shapeless and sloppy on its own, but I made it work with a long vest and scarf.

I will likely rent this again. I wore it with a belt because it looked better that way in the morning and I received a lot of compliments in the morning. The print looked a bit Versace and the material made me feel expensive. The compliments started to die down later on when the fabric started to crease around the belt and from sitting at the office. It's 2019 - I just don't understand why we can have self-lacing shoes, but not make clothes that don't wrinkle? Like, yes, it's 100% silk, but if my $25 sale Gap Softspun dress doesn't wrinkle, I frankly expect more from a $500 Tory Burch.

Sleeves were a bit long, but I just rolled them up. I thought about wearing a belt but it just never looked right. The one downside is that the fabric is almost see-through in the butt area, so I had to wear nude underwear. The long white tank top I wore underneath could be seen.","May 29, 2019","Large"

The pattern and colors are absolutely amazing, and I received so many compliments both times I've worn it. It's also super comfy- it feels like you're wearing a nightshirt. The only thing I could find wrong (and I had to look hard) was that it wrinkles pretty easily.","March 20, 2019","Large"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/TYB114","Sophie","Lovely silk- lots of compliments","PROS— 100% silk, gorgeous feel and fab pattern. CONS— no pockets, sleeves a bit snug and not long enough for me but not in a chic way (6' tall), neck too tight to button all the way up, dress slightly too short + too much static to risk wearing to work if it clung to my butt or something. So I wore it as a top. Luckily had a skirt that matched! A bit shapeless too but I feel like this style is supposed to be a tailored fit? Would not recommend for larger busts as it's a true button-up and would gap... luckily mine arrived with 2 safety pins in the perfect places so wasn't an issue at all for me! WOULD BE PERFECT FOR: Someone 5'3 to 5'9"" with a wirey frame or someone with a pear shape if you add a belt? Idk the material is lovely.","December 1, 2018","Work"

I'm a size 6 in the Charcoal Flat Boucle but size 2 in this coat. This coat appears to be on the lighter/thinner side so it would probably be best for 40-50 degree weather for fall/beginning of winter. The fur collar came separate from the coat so I had to put it on but it is nice that it is removable. The coat is BIG overall - very loose in the hip/waist (and I have wider hips) and you can also tell based on the shoulder pads coming a little farther than my shoulders. It looks like it's just tan/white and red in the pictures but there are specks of blue which is nice and unexpected. Would rent again but in one size smaller!","December 27, 2019","Large"

I wore the smallest size available, and it is still big, so I even don't think sizing down is going to achieve a fitted look for most people. Instead, realize that if you want to wear only fitted blouses, this isn't the blouse for you. I personally love an oversized silk blouse with skinny jeans. Thus, this blouse was a hit with me. I think it's weird that people on RTR gauge the success of an outfit on the amount of external validation received, but since it seems to be worth mentioning for so many people, I concede that I received many compliments on the top, and have worn it several times in the week I've have it during my unlimited subscription.","March 9, 2019","Everyday"

"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/MAR53","Lisa e","Cool and editorial, a bit tricky to style","I love this fabulous shirt, although to be honest I had a difficult time styling it – I think mostly because of the colors. I do love the colors – the pink is so pretty and I like how the patterns mix on the front and back of the shirt, and there is light blue piping which is probably hard to see in pictures but really gives it an extra special something. In terms of fit, it’s definitely super oversized. It wasn’t too long, but long enough that you can wear it with any low-waist pants you may have left over without exposing anything. A bit too long to wear with shorts without tucking it in. You could definitely size down if you are between, or even size down one size probably regardless, but it’s supposed to be an oversized fit. The shirt looks very nice over skinny pants – I wore it with white jeans, which was a good color combo, but because of the dark royal/navy I didn’t think it looked good with blue jeans except for a really light wash. It also looked surprisingly great tucked into a casual short black summer skirt with a relaxed, medium-rise waist – I tried it with something high-waisted and full-skirted and that didn’t work AT ALL. I liked it generally over a fuller skirt untucked too, but that is very editorial and will not please girls who are looking for something “flattering.” All in all, it doesn’t really play with a structured bottom well and is best either over something similarly relaxed or over a legging pant. It’s a challenging item but very chic and worth a try – the perfect rental.","June 19, 2018","Large"

At times, I've had to wear a tank under these, but didn't with this one. It is a heavy, but not hot, material with the metallic thread. I did have to really watch how I stood or sat, as the material slides past each other very easily and sitting down, could have easily had it fall open to my waist if I didn't hold it! But was aware, so was careful and got a lot of compliments on this. Will be a great one for casual holiday parties too.","October 4, 2018","Party"

Running true to size, I recommend sizing up for a backup size for a looser fit. The S I wore was great for tucking in - but for a more casual fit I would size up. The stars on this sweater were eye catching and gave the sweater a cool vibe. The fabric stretched and gave in necessary areas (i.e the bust & hips). The sleeves had a little volume when sitting properly which gave the top another interesting element! I think this is a great sweater for everyday wear but can also easily be dressed up.","December 3, 2018","True to Size"
"https://www.renttherunway.com/pdp/items/PK192","Teresa","A touch of sparkle","I kept this for a few weeks over the holidays and it was perfect for several informal occasions, delivering just a little bit of a festive vibe. The stars are knit with some metallic thread for a subtle shine, and the sleeves provide an interesting but wearable silhouette. Only downside, the fabric is a tiny bit stiff. But that does mean the sleeves keep their shape, rather than drooping as some oft-worn rentals seem to do. Fit-wise, it was a tad short on me and I would maybe have preferred more length in the sleeves, but I have a long torso. Overall a fun everyday piece.","February 18, 2018","Everyday"

I'm really into stars this season and thought this print was super fun, I worked it to a wine tasting with high waisted black jeans. The stars are the tiniest bit sparkly but not too flashy at all. The material is a little different for a sweater, it's kinda slinky, makes it a little more dressy. I loved the loose sleeves and also the waist is a little fitted I think giving an overall slimming look for a sweater.

Fun & unique bell sleeves, but they're cropped so you don't have to worry about getting them in your food or anything if you're out to eat, which I was. I'm tall, so the sleeves were about 3/4 length on me. I have a long torso, and it hit below my belly button. Rented this to wear for Valentine's Day out with a couple other couples. I felt really cute in it! Material isn't as soft as I expected, but it wasn't an issue at all. Paired it with black jeans and black boots on a very cold night, wore an undershirt, and a long warm coat. I'm usually a Small, but that wasn't available. Glad I actually got the Medium, it was on the smaller side of Medium, which was a nice and comfy fit. Nice fitted fit, but without being tight, worked well. I don't like bulky sweaters, and that wasn't an issue with this at all. It wasn't too thin either. Right in the middle. Wanted to buy! Will prob. rent again, loved it :)","February 16, 2020","Small"

Although I didn't love it in Chicago October, I do think this could be appropriate for warmer weather, a tropical vacation, or something like that. I ended up wearing it to a day of casual meetings at work, and I think it would be too casual for my actual job as a high school teacher unless I dressed it up well. I got a few compliments, but it did remind me of the scrubs my mom wears in her job as a pediatric nurse. That said, this jumpsuit was SUPER comfy and relatively flattering. I'm 5'4"", so the length was a little awkward (just a tiny bit cropped). All in all, I would consider renting this again for a more appropriate occasion/weather.","October 17, 2019","Everyday"

The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I got a size 40R and I probably should have gotten a 42R.

I followed advice and sized up where I am usually a 10 / 42 - rented the 44.

I would definitely recommend them for anyone with more of an hourglass figure, as the waist was great on me, but definitely runs small compared to the rest of the cut.

I went a size up and it was still tight. The material is thick, though, and had a tiny bit of stretch. Not the kind of stretch one expects from stretchy jeans, just enough that after the second wear, they fit great and after the third wear they were very comfortable but still supportive. They are jeans, but my work environment is business casual for women and I've been able to get away with wearing these to work since they don't technically look like jeans. I kept them so long the first time I had them I just sent them back to be cleaned. Now I'm thinking of renting them again.","February 5, 2020","Small"

I'm typically a 30 and rented a 32, they fit well and didn't stretch out too much. I have fuller hips/butt so if you have a straighter shape I'd say sizing up 1 size would be best. Overall they're a nice mom jean that is fitted enough in the hips/stomach to avoid the front pooch that mom jeans sometimes create. They're a little longer than what was looking for so wore them a few times and then returned for another pair of cropped Agolde jeans that I'm currently loving.","February 7, 2020","Small"

I'm tall with fairly wide shoulders.. I don't usually have much issue with dressing, this dress was a little tight in my shoulders while being a little loose in the waist. It was pretty short for work, but that's to be expected with my height. As many others have commented the neck line is pretty weird. I don't mind things that are loose on the top, but this really hung open and had zero structure. Mine also had a weird crease that I just couldn't get to lay right. I wore this one with nothing underneath and felt too exposed when I moved around. The second time I wore it with a black tank top and that was better. It wasn't a total flop, but I definitely wouldn't rent again.","July 29, 2019","True to Size"

Sleeves are a great length too, as I have a scar on my upper left arm I don't like to broadcast too often. The ruching at the shoulders gives it that extra flair for the office.

It's a wrap style, so it's nice to be able to cinch as tight or loose as you want. It's a little low cut especially for someone with a larger chest but I didn't mind and I feel like this picture doesn't so it justice - the color is awesome and I felt really comfortable all day.

I'm a bit shorter so this sits right above my knees, which makes it a perfect work dress. This can easily be worn to a fancy dinner with a pair of heels.

I have a slender neck, but the dress was uncomfortably tight around my neck. It would also probably fit a straight/narrow body type best, as I have hips and a butt and it was far too clingy around that area to be appropriate (or flattering) for any type of work or formal event. The longs were also WAY too long for my 5' 4"" frame. For reference, I'm 165 lbs and a true hourglass figure. Sent it back unworn.","March 2, 2020","Small"

In addition, the sweater itself is boxy and oversized, and the neck hole was too wide. It was unflattering all around. My entire family laughed at it and told me to take it off.

I normally wear an 8, but I needed for an event and they were only available in a 10 which fit me fine, so I would say they probably run a bit small. I loved the pockets, the length and the slit at the bottom, but the issue was that they were boxy, so you really needed to tuck in a shirt, but they were SO high waisted (right below my ribs) that it would not have looked right to tuck anything in.

I love the material and details, but there was some things off about the overall fit. I generally have a shorter torso and longer legs... with that said, the bottom of the top hit right around the hip area making your hips look larger than they are. Also the under lining (while necessary) is large and not form fitting making your stomach area also appear large. For work I tucked the lining in while leaving the lace layer out which greatly helped it in appearing not flattering. Since the top is so flowy I would suggest sizing down.","August 21, 2018","Work"

I like my shirts a little loose, and even sizing down to a small, there was still quite a bit of room. It was a nice shirt to wear to work, and I'd probably rent it again for that purpose. Wasn't exciting enough to wear out for a date night, or a night out with friends, but something different for work. Personally, I probably couldn't wear this in the winter when I was slightly paler because it would completely wash me out.","August 15, 2018","Large"

They are very light and I neither loved nor hated them. Firstly, they are extremely comfortable - quite stretchy but nice and thick, with a great high waist. In terms of fit though, they run pretty small. I ordered the 27 hoping they would be super relaxed and roomy for my holiday vacation and when I put them on they were perfect and tight - they fit like a 25 imo. I didn’t love the length combined with the very slight flare - what is a cute kick flare on the model was sort of a frumpy, full-length, barely-bootcut on me. Bottom line: I might try these a size down to see if they end up a little shorter, sometime that I have occasion for a sleek tight jean.","December 27, 2019","Small"

I'd prefer it didn't have the huge white label but wore with sweaters, so this wasn't a problem. In addition, while prepared for the marbled material, I would probably have purchased if they were solid black (which I think would've looked more dressy).

The wool is so soft and the inside is lined with silk - only thing to keep in mind is if you have a pet, this really catches every bit of hair so keep a lint roller on hand. I recommend sizing up if you plan to wear chunky sweaters underneath. While the wool makes this pretty warm, it is a bit thin - I wore this in 30F temperatures and was warm if I layered a thick sweater underneath and wore a hat and scarf.

(But too short of a dress for work)","Sorry for the terribly obnoxious photo, hahahaha... anyway, I am usually always a size M, and when I'm not an M, I'm an L. I wore this size M sweater with just tights - not even leggings, tights - and it covered my behind enough for me to go to a bar and play darts/pong/drinking games all night without showing anything. So yeah, quite oversized! The cut of the neckline is a little strange, not quite a scoop neck. the sweater is a cute pink color which was a nice feminine balance to the bagginess. Pills rather easily and got lint stuck on it relatively easy too. I would rent this again but would not buy it.","December 18, 2018","Date"

Nice enough for you to dress up, cocktail party, and formal enough to wear at work (if you wear a blazer of course).
