# Introduction
Remember, when we were younger, our mother used to give our old clothes to our siblings or other smaller kids in the neighborhood. It was a tradition of almost all the families, to reuse the old stuff. This tradition is now taking it's whole new level. It is not confined just within the family but is a billion-dollar industry on its own. Many new companies are now emerging daily, with millions of users buying used items from them. One can find almost all the items ranging from electronics, furniture, properties, and much more. But due to the rise in social media, there are new trends every day.
